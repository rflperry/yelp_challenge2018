==Early life, education and career==
Napolitano was born and raised in [[Brownsville, Texas]]. After high school, she married and moved with her husband to California where they raised five children.

Napolitano began her political career as a member of the [[Norwalk, California|Norwalk]] City Council, winning her first election in 1986 by a mere 28 votes. Four years later she won re-election by the highest margin of votes recorded in city history. In 1989, Napolitano was elevated by her council colleagues to serve as Mayor. During her council tenure, she focused much of her attention on providing access to constituents and on redevelopment and transportation issues to address the city's need for jobs and a more diversified economic base.

Following her retirement in 1992, she was elected to the [[California Assembly]], and became a leader on international trade, environmental protection, transportation and immigration.

===Congressional Mental Health Caucus===

The bipartisan caucus included more than 70 members during the 108th Congress and over 90 members during the 109th Congress.

Napolitano is also concerned with suicide prevention among Latina adolescents noting that nearly one-out-of-three has seriously contemplated suicide, the highest rate for any ethnic or racial group in the country. In 2001, she claimed responsibility for getting funds included in the Labor-HHS-Education appropriations bill for a pilot project supporting school-based, mental health services in her district. To date, $1.6 million has been secured for this program now operating in 4 local schools.

In 2011, Napolitano voted against the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362?page=1 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2013-09-21}}</ref>

===Health Task Force===
Napolitano established a district Health Task Force composed of health providers, educators and experts throughout the local area. The Task Force helps keep the Congresswoman apprised of key health issues facing her constituents and works with the Congresswoman to devise programs and projects to improve health care and health outcomes for the local area. The Congresswoman also works with the Health Task Force to pursue funding options through California's Proposition 63 Mental Health Services Expansion and for additional training of nursing professionals at both the entry level (CNAs and LVNs) and RNs with advanced degrees.

===Manufacturing Task Force===
The Congresswoman has initiated a Manufacturing Task Force in her district, composed of various small and mid-sized companies. The task force meets as needed to examine key issues and work on strategies that will foster more manufacturing jobs and create a positive climate for manufacturing retention and growth.

===Local events===
Napolitano hosts various events throughout the year, informing residents of her District on the impact of federal legislation and policy, and honoring local constituents for their outstanding achievements. Prominent among these events are the annual [[Congressional Art Competition]] and Women of the Year recognition ceremonies.

==Coverage by Mainstream Media==
A 2009 story first reported by Bloomberg News<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&sid=aUZXCuqGb_Lw#| title = California's Napolitano Makes $220,000 From 1998 Campaign Loan. | date = 2009-02-13 | accessdate = 2009-02-13 | work=Bloomberg}}</ref> and further detailed by the Los Angeles Times<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2009/feb/14/local/me-napolitano14|publisher=Los Angeles Times}}</ref>  questioned the personal loan interest rate that the [[Federal Election Commission]] had authorized her to use during her initial 1998 run for Congress.  Both Bloomberg and the Times noted that the FEC had accepted the argument that the eighteen percent rate was equivalent to the early withdrawal penalty that Napolitano was subject to by withdrawing $150,000 from her employee retirement fund and then loaning those funds to her campaign.  Both sources also reported the rate dropping to ten percent in 2006, and cited FEC filings as of December 31, 2009 indicating that $221,780 in interest had been paid.  [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]], a Washington DC based newspaper, reported that Federal Election Commission filings<ref>{{cite web|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/fecimg/?C00334706|publisher=Federal Election Commission|accessdate=14 March 2014}}</ref> for the campaign reporting period ending September 30, 2010 had indicated that the debt had been completed retired.<ref>{{cite news | url = http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1007-other/217681-report-members-of-congress-keep-money-in-the-family| title = Report: Members of Congress find ways to keep money in the family | date = 2012-03-22 | accessdate = 2012-04-02 | work=The Hill}}</ref>  The story was again referenced by CBS News in a 60 Minutes episode in October 2013.  This was the first such time that the Congresswoman responded firsthand, where she countered the media's implication that she had personally benefited from the loan, stating “It isn’t like I’ve really profited. I still live in the same house. I drive a small car. I am not a billionaire, or a millionaire, for that matter.”

In January 2011, CNN State of the Union featured Napolitano<ref>{{cite web|title=Lawmakers: Close look needed at mental health issues|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2011/01/16/lawmakers-close-look-needed-at-mental-health-issues/|publisher=CNN}}</ref>  as part of a bipartisan panel alongside Republican [[Timothy F. Murphy|Tim Murphy]] to discuss adolescent mental illness in the wake of the January 8, 2011 shooting in Tucson, Arizona that resulted in the deaths of six and wounding of nineteen, including Arizona Congresswoman [[Gabrielle Giffords]].  Asked why there wasn't more coverage of the mental health issues outside of this and other gun violence tragedies, Napolitano Napolitano told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley. "Unfortunately it does not hit the radar scope in Washington or almost in any state house ... It's always something you don't talk about, you don't discuss because of the stigma, and I think we need to address that heavily."

In February, 2011, MSNBC's NewsNation interviewed Napolitano alongside LA Lakers basketball player [[Ron Artest]] to discuss her introduction of HR 751, the Mental Health in Schools Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m9L7_UB7pMs|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>   When asked why she was focusing her attention on mental health issues, she explained her experience with a successful local pilot initiative partnering with the [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration]] (SAMHSA), however noted that securing funding was challenging despite recent violent school tragedies, saying "Children don't vote - and to me that's a crime because our children need help and we need to provide it for them."

==Personal life==
Napolitano is married to Frank Napolitano, retired restaurateur and community activist. They have five grown children, fourteen grandchildren, and one great grandson. She is not related to former [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], [[Janet Napolitano]].
