Jo Bonner (R) |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/jo-bonner-al/  |work=National Journal Almanac |publisher=[[National Journal]]}}</ref>

Two years later he started working as campaign press secretary for U.S. Congressman [[Sonny Callahan]], a Republican representing [[Alabama's 1st congressional district]]. In 1989, Bonner was promoted to Callahan's chief of staff and moved to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].<ref name="bio"/>

Bonner has served as a member of the board of directors for the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, [[Rotary International|Rotary]] Club, Leadership Mobile, and the Mobile Chapter of the University of Alabama Alumni Association. In 2000, the College of Communications at the University of Alabama honored him as their Outstanding Alumnus in Public Relations. He was a member of Leadership Mobile, Class of 2000, where his classmates elected him co-president.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://bonner.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2164&Itemid=83|title=Congressman Jo Bonner, Biography|publisher=Jo Bonner's Congressional Website|accessdate=2012-02-24}}</ref>

===Elections===
{{Further|Electoral History of Jo Bonner}}
;2002
In 2002, he ran for seat vacated by retiring Republican U.S. Representative [[Sonny Callahan]]. In the primary, he ranked first with 40% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=87126</ref> In the run-off election Bonner defeated Tom Young, chief of staff to [[U.S. Senator]] [[Richard Shelby]] 62%-38%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=87127</ref> He won the general election with 61% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=914</ref>

;2004&ndash;2010
During this time period, Bonner never won re-election with less than 63% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=2529</ref>

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2012|#District 1}}

After redistricting, Bonner decided to run for re-election to his sixth term in the newly redrawn [[Alabama's 1st congressional district]]. In the Republican primary, he drew three opponents.<ref>[http://blog.al.com/live/2012/02/mobile_bar_polls_judicial_race.html ''Alabama Press-Register'' "Mobile Bar polls judicial races; new candidate in AL-01 (Political Skinny)" February 13, 2012]</ref>

An anti-incumbent super [[Political Action Committee|PAC]] called the [[Campaign for Primary Accountability]] spent $21,000 to try to unseat Bonner. Bonner told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that “obviously, when the Supreme Court made their decision to open up corporate war chests, this is the result." Bonner said he believed he would survive the primary challenge because his campaign expenditures far exceed the money being spent against him. “If I hadn’t had $1 million in my account, I could be underwater right now,” said Bonner.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/us/politics/anti-incumbent-super-pac-adds-to-congresss-insecurity.html?_r=2 ''New York Times'', "‘Super PAC’ Increasing Congress’s Sense of Insecurity", March 8, 2012]</ref> According to [[Federal Election Commission]] records, Bonner spent $650,000 on his re-election campaign. His three opponents spent a combined total of under $275,000. No Democratic candidates have filed to run against Bonner in the general election.<ref>[http://blog.al.com/live/2012/03/post_173.html ''[[Press-Register|Alabama Press-Register]]'', "Rep. Jo Bonner wins GOP nomination for Alabama's 1st Congressional District", March 13, 2012]</ref>

Bonner won the Republican primary with 56% of the vote. He won all of the counties in the district.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=743052</ref>

===Tenure===
Bonner has been a moderate Republican representing a conservative district. Perhaps his most notable dissention was his opposition to on-shore [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) terminals for Mobile, but went on to propose an off-shore option for the future. He pushed for Representative Callahan's seat on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] but did not carry the support of his colleagues. Bonner hosted the [[Gulf Coast Congressional Report]] from 2003 to 2006, when the program was halted in response to an equal-time complaint by Vivian Beckerle, Bonner’s opponent in the 2006 election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Gulf Coast Congressional Report Free Online|url=http://www.ovguide.com/gulf-coast-congressional-report-9202a8c04000641f80000000055901f8#|publisher=[[OVGuide]]|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes on Mobile & Baldwin Politics & Law|url=http://modmobilian.com/notes/notespolitics/|publisher=Mod Mobilian|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref>

Prior to being sworn into the 108th Congress, [[Majority Whip]] [[Roy Blunt]], a [[Missouri]] Republican, named Bonner an Assistant Whip. The appointment made Bonner one of a number of freshmen who were part of weekly leadership meetings with Blunt, the second-ranking member in the Republican Leadership behind only  the [[Majority Leader]]. Blunt has since become a U.S. senator. On December 14, 2005, Bonner voted for the reauthorization of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. On June 29, 2005, he voted for a $25 million increase in funding for anti-[[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] print and television ads. On October 6, 2005, he voted for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. On July 13, 2006, he was one of thirty-three votes against renewal of the [[Voting Rights Act]].<ref name="bio"/>

In December 2011, Bonner voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required Congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name ="FreedomWorks">{{cite web|title=FreedomWorks Scorecard|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/jo-bonner-0}}</ref>

According to the website Open Congress, Bonner votes with the Republican Party 93.5% of the time. This ranked 88th among the 242 House Republicans in 2011.<ref>[http://www.opencongress.org/people/votes_with_party/house/republican ''Open Congress'' "Voting With Party," Accessed October 28, 2011]</ref>

[[Heritage Action for America]], a conservative policy advocacy organization, reports that 55% of Bonner's votes align with Heritage's preferred policy stances.<ref>[http://heritageactionscorecard.com/scorecard/index.html#B001244#member''Heritage Action for America'' "Scorecard," Accessed March 10, 2012]</ref>

Bonner has received a 0% on the legislative scorecards  for [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]], the [[Human Rights Campaign]], and the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].<ref>[http://thehill.com/resources/lawmaker-ratings/76379-rep-jo-bonner-r-ala''The Hill'' "Rep. Jo Bonner (R-Ala., 1st) Lawmaker Scorecard," Accessed March 10, 2012]</ref>

In 2008, following Bonner's appointment to the [[United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], free-market advocacy group [[FreedomWorks]] called on Bonner to accept a personal one-year moratorium on accepting earmarks. A FreedomWorks statement said that "Representative Bonner has a long history of securing earmarks for his district, and voting in favor of egregious pork projects on the House floor."<ref>[http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/freedomworks-calls-on-rep-jo-bonner-r-al-to-take-p''FreedomWorks'' "FreedomWorks Calls on Rep.

Bonner has declined to join the [[Tea Party Caucus]], saying:<ref>Talbot, George.  [http://blog.al.com/live/2010/08/talbot_jo_bonner_runs_into_ang.html "Talbot: Jo Bonner runs into anger during weeklong district tour"], ''[[Press-Register]]'' (August 25, 2010).</ref>

<blockquote>I try not to get involved in caucuses that make me look like a radical, right-wing nut. I don’t think that’s what the Tea Party is, but I want to avoid the appearance.</blockquote>

In 2007, Bonner voted to increase the federal [[minimum wage]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll018.xml''House of Representatives Vote Results'' "Fair Minimum Wage Act," January 10, 2007]</ref> In 2008, he voted in favor of [[Troubled Asset Relief Program|TARP]], the financial bail out package.<ref name=post>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jo-bonner-r-ala/gIQAoL2cKP_topic.html''Washington Post'' "Jo Bonner (R-Ala.)," Accessed February 24, 2012]</ref> Bonner voted against Republican-supported regulations on the credit-card industry and the Cash for Clunkers program.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll228.xml''House of Representatives Vote Results'' "Credit Cardholders’ Bill of Rights Act of 2009," April 30, 2009]</ref> Bonner supported the Iraq war and opposed a timetable for withdrawal of American troops.<ref name=post/> He supports warrantless wiretapping.

;2012 Africa trip
In March 2013, ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]'' reported that in August 2012 Bonner and his wife took a $16,214.66 trip to a private 66,000-acre ranch in Kenya, paid for entirely by the [[International Conservation Caucus Foundation]].
