===Legislation sponsored===
Whitfield introduced the [[Electricity Security and Affordability Act (H.R. 3826; 113th Congress)]] into the House on January 9, 2014.<ref name=3826sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3826 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3826|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=6 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would repeal a pending rule published by the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) on January 8, 2014.<ref name=cbo3826>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 3826|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45112|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 February 2014}}</ref> The proposed rule would establish uniform national limits on [[greenhouse gas]] (GHG) emissions from new [[Power station|electricity-generating facilities]] that use [[coal]] or [[natural gas]].<ref name="cbo3826"/><ref name=HousevotesBlock>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes to block EPA regs on coal-fired electricity plants|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/e2-wire/e2-wire/200096-house-votes-to-block-epa-regs-on-electricity-plants|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=6 March 2014}}</ref> The rule also sets new standards of performance for those power plants, including the requirement to install [[Carbon capture and storage|carbon capture]] and [[Carbon sequestration|sequestration]] technology.<ref name="cbo3826"/> Whitfield said that, if finalized, the EPA's rule would "make it impossible to build a new coal-powered plant in American...

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kentucky, 2010}}
Whitfield had been a Democrat for most of his life, but in 1994 filed to run in the 1st District as a Republican. He defeated the 1992 Republican nominee, Steve Hamrick, in the primary, and then narrowly defeated freshman Democratic Congressman [[Thomas Barlow (politician)|Tom Barlow]] by only 2,500 votes. He narrowly defeated Dennis Null in 1996 even as [[Bill Clinton]] carried the district, but hasn't faced a close race since.  Although Democrats have a nearly 2-to-1 edge in registration, they tend to be very conservative on social issues, a trend that has helped Whitfield strengthen his hold on the district.
Whitfield’s major legislative accomplishments are creating the 170,000 acre of National Recreation Area at the Land between the Lakes, introducing and passing legislation to create a Health Compensation Program at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion plant. He paid over $315,000,000 in compensation to the 3,139 employees and survivors. He also helped create the first Medicare Prescription Drug benefit plan for seniors and is an active advocate for the humane treatment of animals. <ref>{{cite web|last=NA|title=Congressman Ed Whitfield|url=http://whitfield.house.gov/about/biography|accessdate=3/8/2012}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Whitfield's wife, Constance Whitfield, is a former Assistant [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] and now a paid lobbyist for the Humane Society of the United States
