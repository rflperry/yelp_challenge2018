=== Elections ===
;2009
{{Main|California's 10th congressional district special election, 2009}}
Despite living outside of [[California's 10th congressional district]], Garamendi announced his intention to run for the 2009 special election in the 10th district, where Democratic U.S. Congresswoman [[Ellen Tauscher]] had vacated her seat. There was some confusion about the location of Garamendi's residence. Garamendi said: "My front yard is in the district, our bedroom is not."<ref name="Changes course">{{cite news|last=Marinucci|first=Carla|title=Garamendi changes course for Tauscher's seat|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/04/22/BAAF1776NO.DTL|accessdate=7 June 2012|newspaper=SF Gate|date=23 April 2009}}</ref>  Garamendi continued to fuel speculation about the location of his residence when he made similar comments to the NYT in July, stating the same thing. The Sacramento Board of Elections later confirmed that no portion of Garamendi’s property lies within Congressional District 10.

In the September election, no candidate reached the 50% threshold to avoid a run-off election. Garamendi ranked first among Democrats with 26% of the vote, defeating State Senator [[Mark DeSaulnier]] (18%) and Assemblymember [[Joan Buchanan]] (12%). In the November run-off special election, Garamendi defeated Republican nominee [[David Harmer]] 53%-43%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=557824 Our Campaigns - CA - District 10 - Special Election Runoff Race - Nov 03, 2009<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elect-results/cd10-results.htm California Secretary of State election results, Tenth CD, November 2009]</ref> After winning the special election on November 3, Garamendi was sworn in as a member of the US House of Representatives on November 5, 2009.<ref>[http://www.kcra.com/politics/21531579/detail.html "Garamendi Takes Oath In Congress"], KCRA.com, November 5, 2009.</ref>
