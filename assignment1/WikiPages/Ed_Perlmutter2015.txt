===2006===
{{Main|Colorado 7th congressional district election, 2006}}
Perlmutter won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for the 7th District by defeating former State Representative [[Peggy Lamm]] and college professor [[Herb Rubenstein]], with 53% of the vote in the primary. State education chairman [[Rick O'Donnell]] was unopposed for the Republican nomination. [[Dave Chandler]], a Green, was also a candidate.

The seat was held by Republican [[Bob Beauprez]], who was reelected to a second term in [[U.S. House elections, 2004|2004]] with 55% of the vote, after winning his first term by only 121 votes. He left the seat at the end of the 2004–2006 term, having failed in his bid to become [[Governor of Colorado]].

In late September, O'Donnell was put on the defensive when ads appeared noting that he had previously supported abolishing Social Security. A Survey USA poll soon after that showed Perlmutter with a 54 to 37 percent lead, although GOP consultants guessed that the support was "soft".<ref>[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_5024085,00.html ]{{Dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref> An October 4 poll released by Zogby showed Perlmutter ahead of O'Donnell by 45-34 percent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Results in key House races: Reuters poll|agency=Reuters|date=2006-10-04|work=Washington Post|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100400310.html}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> ''Cook Political Report'' rating: ''Republican Toss Up''. ''CQPolitics'' rating: ''No Clear Favorite''.

In the end, Perlmutter (54%) soundly defeated O'Donnell (42%) for the congressional seat, helping Democrats to regain the majority in the U.S. House.

===2012===
Perlmutter defeated Republican nominee [[Joe Coors Jr.]] on November 6, 2012. Perlmutter's victory came despite new congressional boundaries that made his district 4 percent less Democratic.

Perlmutter led Coors by 17 percentage points in Adams County, where 40 percent of the constituents in the newly drawn 7th District live.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_21941755/neighbors-perlmutter-coors-square-off-new-7th-district|title=Perlmutter wins fourth term, Coors tapped out in 7th district|last=Bartels|first=Lynn|date=2012-06-11|publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=7 August 2014}}</ref>
