==Early life, education, and business career==
McNerney was born in [[Albuquerque, New Mexico]], the son of Rosemary (née Tischhauser) and Col. John E. McNerney. He is of Swiss and Irish descent.<ref>[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/mcnerney.htm Profile], freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com; accessed November 20, 2014.</ref> He attended St. Joseph's Military Academy in [[Hays, Kansas]], and, for two years, the [[United States Military Academy]] at West Point. After leaving West Point in 1971 in protest of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War,<ref>[http://www.opencongress.org/wiki/Gerald_McNerney Profile], opencongress.org; accessed November 20, 2014.</ref> he enrolled at the [[University of New Mexico]] in Albuquerque, where he received Bachelor's and Master's degrees and, in 1981, a Ph.D. in Mathematics, with a doctoral dissertation in differential geometry.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://genealogy.math.ndsu.nodak.edu/id.php?id=102206|title=Mathematics Genealogy Project|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}</ref>

McNerney served several years as a contractor to [[Sandia National Laboratories]] at [[Kirtland Air Force Base]] on national security programs. In 1985, he accepted a senior engineering position with U.S. Windpower (Kenetech). In 1994, he began working as an energy consultant for [[Pacific Gas and Electric|PG&E]], FloWind, The Electric Power Research Institute, and other utility companies. Before being elected to Congress, Jerry served as the [[CEO]] of a 2004 start-up company manufacturing [[wind turbine]]s, named HAWT Power (Horizontal Axis Wind Turbine Power). A 1992 article that he co-authored in an IEEE journal is a good example of his writings during this period.<ref>G. McNerney and R. Richardson, “The Statistical Smoothing of Power Delivered to Utilities by Multiple Wind Turbines”, IEEE Transactions on Energy Conversion 7:4 (Dec. 1992), pp. 644–47.</ref>

===Elections===
;2004
McNerney first ran for Congress against [[Richard Pombo]] in California's 11th congressional district in the [[U.S. House elections, 2004|2004 House elections]]. He entered the race two weeks before the primary election as a write-in candidate. He qualified to be a [[write-in candidate]] for the March 2004 primary by one signature. Having no primary opponent, he won the primary and qualified for the November general election ballot as the Democratic nominee. He lost the general election, 61%-39%. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

;2006
{{Main|California 11th congressional district election, 2006}}
McNerney launched his 2006 campaign early in the fall of 2005. In June 2006 he won the Democratic primary with 52.8% of the vote, defeating Steve Filson, who had been endorsed by the DCCC, and Stevan Thomas. {{cn|date=November 2014}}

In late July, Republicans [[Pete McCloskey]] and Tom Benigno (both of whom ran in the Republican primary against Pombo) endorsed McNerney.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/24/AR2006072400877.html|title=missingtitle|author=missingauthor|work=[[Washington Post]]|date=2006-07-24}}</ref> In September, analysis of the campaign was changed from "Republican safe" to "Republican favored" due to the emergence of McNerney's campaign.

For his first three terms, McNerney represented a district that encompassed eastern [[Alameda County]], most of San Joaquin County and a small portion of Santa Clara County.  After redistricting, his district was renumbered as the 9th District.  It lost its portion of Alameda County, including McNerney's home in [[Pleasanton, California|Pleasanton]], while picking up part of Sacramento County.  After the new map was announced, McNerney announced he would move to San Joaquin County in the new 9th. Although the new district is somewhat more Democratic than its predecessor, it is influenced by the Central Valley.<ref>{{cite news|last=Garofoli|first=Joe|title=Jerry McNerney looks at new political map, moves to San Joaquin County|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/blogs/nov05election/detail?entry_id=94178|accessdate=25 August 2011|newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle|date=28 July 2011}}</ref> He eventually bought a home in Stockton.
