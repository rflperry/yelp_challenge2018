In 2004, Cleaver was elected to {{ushr|MO|5}}, where his district includes the southern three-fourths of [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]], including  all of the city south of the [[Missouri River]].

He is the first [[African American]] mayor of Kansas City. During the last days of his tenure as Mayor, Reverend Cleaver agreed to an international visit to [[London, England]]. On the invitation of [[United Kingdom|UK]] [[NGO]] Operation Black Vote he assisted in campaigning for increased electoral participation in the elections for the [[Mayor of London]] and the [[London Assembly]].

==Political campaigns==
[[File:Emanuel Cleaver, official Congressional photo portrait.JPG|thumb|right|Earlier official photo of Cleaver]]
In late 2003, [[Karen McCarthy]], who had represented the 5th district since 1995, announced her retirement. Despite having served in city government for 20 years, including eight years as mayor, Cleaver initially posted weak numbers in the Democratic primary and general elections. Cleaver went on to defeat former [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] Administration official [[Jamie Metzl]] in the Democratic primary by a margin of 60-40 percent. In the general election, [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Jeanne Patterson used her own fortune to fund her candidacy and made the race far more competitive than conventional wisdom would suggest for the district, which has long been reckoned as the second-most Democratic district in Missouri. The Democrats have held this seat for all but eight years since 1909, and without interruption since 1949.  By comparison, McCarthy won 65 percent in 2002.

Cleaver has been reelected twice with some opposition.  In 2010, Jacob Turk (Republican) received 45 percent of the vote, with Cleaver receiving 53 percent.  In 2012, Cleaver received 60 percent of the vote, with Turk receiving 37 percent. <ref>{{cite web|title=5th District (MO) Election Results|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Missouri%27s_5th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=BallotPedia.org|accessdate=15 October 2014}}</ref>

===2008 Presidential election===
During the course of the Democratic Presidential Primary, Cleaver endorsed [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]].<ref>[http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=2953 Missouri Rep. Emanuel Cleaver II Endorses Clinton] ''hillaryclinton.com'', August 21, 2007</ref> Cleaver claimed that African American [[superdelegate]]s who supported Clinton were subjected to harassment, threatened with primary opponents and called “[[Uncle Tom]].” He said they were told, “You’re not black if you’re not supporting [[Barack Obama]]. … It's ugly.”<ref>[http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/10266 Cleaver: Black superdelegates backing Clinton are being "threatened"] ''Kansas City Star'', Keith Chrostowski, February 28, 2008</ref> On March 30, 2008, he was interviewed on ''The Sunday Edition'' on [[CBC Radio]] and said he realized he was on the losing team: "Even though I don't expect the [[Kansas City Chiefs]] to beat the [[Indianapolis Colts]], I cheer for the Kansas City Chiefs." <ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/blogs/trailhead/archive/2008/04/01/what-not-to-say-on-canadian-radio.aspx What Not To Say on Canadian Radio], Christopher Beam, ''Slate'', April 1, 2008</ref> According to [http://BlackMissouri.com BlackMissouri.com].,<ref>[http://blackmissouri.com/digest/emanuel-cleaver-of-missouri-endorses-hillary-clinton.html Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri Endorses Hillary] ''blackmissouri.com'', February 15, 2008</ref> [[U.S. Representative]] [[Jesse Jackson, Jr.|Jesse Jackson Jr.]] of [[Illinois]] asked Cleaver, “If it comes down to the last day and you’re the only superdelegate? … Do you want to go down in history as the one to prevent a black from winning the [[White House]]?" “I told him I’d think about it," Cleaver explained. Cleaver said during the course of the primary he'd be shocked if Obama wasn't the next President but made it clear he still supported Clinton until she suspended her bid.
