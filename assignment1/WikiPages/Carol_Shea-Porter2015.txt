==Town hall disruptions==
Following the passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], many members of Congress held town hall meetings throughout their districts in an effort to explain and, in some cases, defend their votes. Shea-Porter, like several of her colleagues, found herself on the defensive at two such events held in [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]] and [[Bedford, New Hampshire|Bedford]]. She took about a dozen questions at each, the majority of which “were in opposition to Shea-Porter's health care vote.”<ref = "ULdisrupt">[http://www.unionleader.com/article.aspx?headline=Tempers+hot+at+Shea-Porter+health+meetings&articleId=bbfc20cf-7050-40f0-a894-d72828de6399 "Tempers hot at Shea-Porter health meetings" Union Leader (August 30, 2010)]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref><ref>[http://www.wmur.com/politics/23018268/detail.html "Protesters Question Shea-Porter On Health Care Law: Tea Party Members Plan Protests At Town Hall Meetings" WMUR (March 31, 2010)]</ref>

Shea-Porter was re-elected to a second term in November 2008, defeating Bradley for the second time, winning by 54% to 46% margin.
