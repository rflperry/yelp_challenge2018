==Early life and education==
A fifth generation resident of [[Calhoun County, Alabama|Calhoun County]] in East Alabama, Rogers graduated from Saks High School and earned both his undergraduate degree in Political Science and Masters of Public Administration at [[Jacksonville State University]] in [[Jacksonville, Alabama]].{{source needed | date=February 2014}}

== Early political career ==
At 28 years old, Rogers became the youngest person and first Republican to join the Calhoun County Commission. {{source needed | date=February 2014}} While serving on the Commission and working for the United Way, Rogers enrolled at the [[Birmingham School of Law]] along with his wife, Beth, and upon graduating with honors began a general law practice in Anniston.{{source needed | date=February 2014}} Three years later he started his own firm, which grew to become Anniston's largest.{{Citation needed|date=June 2008}}

In 1994 he won a seat in the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], and became Minority leader in his second term. In 2002, Bob Riley successfully ran for governor, leaving the 3rd district vacant.

In the general election, he faced Democratic veteran Joe Turnham, Jr., who had served three years as state party chairman and had run against Riley in the congressional election in 1998.<ref>"Riley a Rerun in U.S. House," ''The Anniston Star'', November 4, 1998, p. 1A</ref>

He dissented with the Morocco free trade agreement due to potential job losses in the Alabama textile industry.{{source needed | date=February 2014}} On social issues Rogers has voted in opposition to abortion, gay marriage and immigration.{{source needed | date=February 2014}} However, he has acted to protect the Armed Services industry in his area.{{source needed | date=February 2014}} On the Armed Services Committee, he opposed a new series of military base closures and won passage of a bill that would assure that universities would provide access to their facilities for military recruitment purposes and ROTC.{{source needed | date=February 2014}} Despite this, in 2008, he received a rating of 50% from the [[American Conservative Union]], one of the most moderate voting records of a Southern Republican for that year.<ref>[http://www.acuratings.org/2008house.htm ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref>

Rogers was a recipient of former [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]'s [[ARMPAC]] campaign contributions.{{source needed | date=February 2014}} DeLay was prosecuted and convicted on charges of felony money laundering of campaign finances and conspiracy to launder money. To date, Rogers has not offered to return any of the $30,000 he received.<ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by |url=http://ourfuture.org/media_releases/new-data-26-congressmen-bought-out-rep-delay |title=Campaign for America's Future: 26 Congressmen Bought Out by Rep.

After the Democratic Party took control of the House of Representatives in the 2006 elections, Rogers joined many relatively junior Republican members of the House in seeing their perceived influence diminish.  Knowlegis, a nonpartisan lobbying information firm, dropped Rogers from being ranked as the 138th most influential Representative to being 402nd in that category.<ref>"Rogers' Power Drops: Ranking of Congress Members Gives District 3 Representative Low Score," ''The Anniston Star'', April 11, 2008, p. 1A</ref>

Rogers is a signer of [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]â€™s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref name="ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref>

In December 2011, Rogers voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required Congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/michael-rogers-0 |title=Mike Rogers &#124; Congressional Scorecard - FreedomWorks |publisher=Congress.freedomworks.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>

Rogers supported an amendment to declare that people retain the right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property, including schools. He cosponsored legislation to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Rogers sponsored a bill expressing the continued support of Congress for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/mike-rogers/legislation/co_spons_bills.shtml Congressman Mike Rogers: Official Website]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}</ref> He also introduced legislation making it illegal to satirize or in any way parody the Transportation Security Administration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Mike|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3011|title=Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act of 2011|publisher=govtrack.us|accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In a very close election, the Turnham-Rogers contest was one of the most closely watched in 2002.  Both Democratic and Republican National parties targeted the district, with Speaker Dennis Hastert promising Rogers a seat on the Armed Services committee should he win.  Rogers heavily outspent Turnham, raising and spending $1,656,290<ref>[http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_02+H2AL03032 FEC Candidate Summary Reports: Rogers, Michael]</ref> to Turnham's $1,015,132,<ref>[http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_02+H8AL03039 FEC Candidate Summary Reports: Turnham, Joseph]</ref> with Rogers enjoying an even greater margin in independent expenditures.
