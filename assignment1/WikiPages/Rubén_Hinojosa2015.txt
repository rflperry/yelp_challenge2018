'''Rubén E. Hinojosa''' (born August 20, 1940) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|TX|15}}, serving since 1997. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district stretches from [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] (east of San Antonio), to [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] on the Mexican border. Much of the region is rural, although Hidalgo County is part of the third fastest growing metropolitan statistical area in the country.  He serves on the [[House Financial Services Committee|Financial Services]] and [[House Education and the Workforce Committee|Education]] committees.

==Early life, education, and career==
Hinojosa was born in [[Edcouch, Texas]]. The eighth of 11 children, Hinojosa was raised in Hidalgo County, which borders on Mexico, and earned two business degrees at the University of Texas.<ref name="WP Politics"/> He earned his [[bachelor's degree]] in business administration from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and his [[MBA]] from the [[University of Texas-Pan American]]. He served as president and chief financial officer of his family's food processing company, H&H Foods, for twenty years.  President Reagan named H&H the “Number One Minority-Owned Business in America” in 1983.  In 1987 the U.S. Small Business Administration named the Hinojosas “Minority Entrepreneur of the Year.”<ref>{{cite news |title= Court OKs debt plan for H&H Foods|author= Sean Gaffney|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/court-89938-debt-oks.html|newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= 11 September 2008|accessdate= }}</ref>

By 1994, the company was one of the major employers in the Rio Grande area, with 350 employees, and had begun to produce ready-to-eat foods. In 2005 it had $40 million in revenue but had 270 employees.<ref name="H&H">{{cite news |title= Mercedes' H&H Foods files for bankruptcy|author= Kyle Arnold|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/mercedes-83207--.html|newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= |accessdate= }}</ref>

In 1974, he was elected to the [[Texas State Board of Education]], serving for ten years.

Hinojosa’s father and uncle founded H&H Foods in 1947 as a slaughterhouse. Control of the firm passed to himself and his brother, Liborio, in 1976.  He gave up his executive position when he entered Congress, but remained a director and major stockholder.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mercedes' H&H Foods files for bankruptcy|author= Kyle Arnold|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/mercedes-83207--.html|newspaper= The Brownsville Herald|date= 4 January 2008|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
After 32-year incumbent [[Kika de la Garza]] announced his retirement, Hinojosa won a five-way primary for the seat by only 588 votes.  This practically assured him of being only the sixth person to represent this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district.  He defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Tom Haughey with 62% of the vote. He defeated Haughey again in 1998, winning 59% of the vote. In 2000 he took 89% of the vote, facing only independent Frank L. Jones III. In 2002, he was reelected unopposed.  In 2004, Hinojosa faced Republican Michael Thamm in the redrawn District 15 and defeated the former major, winning with 59 percent of the vote. In the 2006 mid-term election he faced Paul Haring and Eddie Zamora, both Republicans. Hinojosa won 61 percent of the vote in the once-again redrawn district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1761 |title=Ourcampaigns.com |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>

In the general election scheduled for November 4, 2014, Hinojosa again faces the Republican 
Eddie Zamora, who received 7,776 votes (54.9 percent) in the primary election held on March 4. Douglas A. "Doug" Carlile (born c. 1963) polled the remaining 6,393 ballots (45.1 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref>

==Political positions==

Hinojosa has been called as a “hard-core [[Liberalism|liberal]]” and a “rank-and-file Democrat”.<ref>{{cite news |title= Texas House: Ruben Hinojosa|author= |url= http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Ruben_Hinojosa.htm |newspaper= On the Issues|date= |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/ruben_hinojosa/400179|title= Rep. Rubén Hinojosa|author= |date= |work= GovTrack|publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>  The 'That's My Congress' website has given Hinojosa a “Liberal Action Score” of 37/100 and a “Conservative Action Score” of 16/100 for his votes in the 112th Congress.<ref name="GovTrack">{{cite news |title= Rep. Ruben Honojosa|author= |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/ruben_hinojosa/400179 |newspaper= GovTrack|date= |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref><ref name="Thats Congress">{{cite news |title= Democratic Representative Rubén Hinojosa of Texas|author= |url= http://thatsmycongress.com/house/repHinojosaTX15112.html |newspaper= That's my Congress|date= |accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>

During the [[111th Congress]], Hinojosa voted with his party 99 percent of the time. He voted to extend the [[Patriot Act]] and supported the 2011 budget compromise.  He voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], otherwise known as, [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act |"Obamacare"]], the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], otherwise known as, “Cap and Trade”, <ref name="Thats Congress"/> and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]].<ref name="GovTrack"/>

Hinojosa has emphasized assisting minorities and low-income Americans gain access to higher education. He has been especially active in supporting water-conservation projects along the Mexican border, and in replacing federal subsidies for student loans with direct government loans. Hinojosa and George Miller were responsible for constructing the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, which increased the maximum Pell Grants available to low-income students and authorized additional funding for minority-serving schools.

He co-sponsored a 2010 bill for enhanced border security, but has opposed the construction of a wall along the border.  

He has also been a very strong supporter of free-trade agreements, and was one of 15 House Democrats to vote for the 2005 Central American Free Trade Agreement.<ref name="WP Politics"/>

Hinojosa supported the introduction, in 2010, of full-body scanners at Valley International Airport.  He said that we need to take more precautions when it comes to public safety, and that the new technology “gives TSA employees a distinct advantage in the prevention of terrorist events.”<ref>{{cite news |title= Valley International Airport to get full-body scanners|author= Gabriel Saldana|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/font-112944-size-small.html |newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= 5 June 2012|accessdate= }}</ref>

In June 2011, Hinojosa introduced legislation that would expand the authority of NADBank, which had already funded more than 100 projects to prevent the release of untreated sewage into the Rio Grande and other bodies of water, to finance infrastructure projects designed to enhance economic development along the border and raise environmental standards.<ref>{{cite news |title= Wastewater projects improve Rio Grande water quality|author= Jared Janes|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/wastewater-128140-rio-water.html|newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= 25 June 2011|accessdate= }}</ref>  

He has also supported measures to aid undocumented workers. He backed the “AgJobs” bill aimed at helping undocumented farm workers. He has been an advocate of the DREAM Act, which would provide citizenship to people who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents.<ref name="WP Politics">{{cite news |title= Ruben Hinojosa (D-Tex.)|author= |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ruben-hinojosa-d-tex/gIQAvN7UAP_topic.html#at-a-glance|newspaper= Washington Post|date= 24 July 2012|accessdate=8 August 2012}}

Rubén Hinojosa) |publisher=TheHill |date=2010-09-21 |accessdate=2014-08-10}}</ref>  He cited his concern that these children came to the US alongside their parents and should not be faulted. Hinojosa argued that “[o]ur country is much better off by being able to let those children get a college education and serve in the military and contribute to the prosperity of our country.”<ref>{{cite news |title= Hinojosa, Hispanic Tea Party support DREAM Act|author= Neil Morton|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/support-129153-bill-local.html|newspaper= The Brownsville Herald|date= 24 July 2011|accessdate=8 August 2012}}</ref>

[[J. M. Lozano]], Republican member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]] in [[Kleberg County, Texas|Kleberg County]], for a time worked on Hinojosa's staff in McAllen beginning in 2003. At the time Lozano was a Democrat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/J.M._Lozano|title=J. M. Lozano|publisher=ballotpedia.org|accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Hinojosa is married to Martha Lopez Hinojosa and they have two daughters, Kaitlin and Karen. He has one son, Ruben Jr., and two daughters from a previous marriage.

===Bankruptcy===
Hinojosa declared personal bankruptcy in December 2010.  He had $2.9 million in debts, mostly owed to Wells Fargo Bank.  
Hinojosa's bankruptcy stems from his personal guarantee of a loan made to his family's food processing company, H&H Foods.
