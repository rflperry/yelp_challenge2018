'''William J. "Bill" Posey'''<ref>http://www.city-data.com/elec2/10/elec-ROCKLEDGE-FL-10.html</ref> (born December 18, 1947) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|FL|8}}, serving in Congress since 2009. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He formerly served in the [[Florida Senate]] and the [[Florida House of Representatives]].

==Early life, education, and business career==

Posey was born in [[Washington, D.C.]], the son of Beatrice (née Tohl) and Walter J. Posey. His mother's family immigrated from [[Russia]].<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/posey.htm</ref> Posey moved to Florida in 1956, as his father took a job in engineering with [[NASA]]. In 1969, he graduated from [[Brevard Community College]] with an [[Associate of Arts]] degree.

He obtained his own work at NASA,{{clarify|date=August 2009}} but was laid off at the end of the [[Apollo Space Program]]. From 1974 to 1976, Bill Posey worked on the Rockledge Planning Commission. In 1976, he was elected as a member of the City Council, and from 1986 to 1992, he was a member of the Brevard County Business and Industrial Development Commission. Posey then founded his own real estate company in the 1970s. He later became director of the state [[National Association of Realtors|Association of Realtors]]. While serving in local politics, he also became a researcher on government [[accountability]] and [[transparency (behavior)|transparency]].

==Florida legislature==
In 2006, Posey authored ''Activity Based Total Accountability'', which outlines his suggestions for improving American politics.

While serving in the state legislature, Posey was a chief sponsor of a bill designed to modernize the Florida election process, in response to the [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|2000 presidential election controversy]]. He also worked to revise insurance policy, so as to aid hurricane victims.<ref>[http://posey.house.gov/about/index.shtml ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><!---general statements are really inadequate here because they are superficial.

===Tenure===
Bill Posey is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection Pledge.<ref>[http://www.atr.org/current-taxpayer-protection-pledge-signers-th-a2851 Current Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers] [http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=28603&can_id=24280]</ref>

On March 12, 2009, Posey introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] H.R. 1503.<ref>[http://www.politico.com/static/PPM119_090313_posey_smith.html Text of H.R. 1503]</ref> Posey claims that the bill, which would require future presidential candidates to provide a copy of their original [[birth certificate]], is a reaction to claims that President [[Barack Obama]] [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|is not a natural born U.S. citizen]].<ref>[http://www.politico.com/blogs/bensmith/0309/Birther_bill_hits_Congress.html Birther bill hits Congress], The Politico, March 13, 2009</ref><ref>[http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2009/03/13/gop-congressman-wants-presidential-candidates-to-prove-citizenship/ Republican wants WH candidates to prove citizenship], CNN, March 13, 2009</ref> Critics, including the editorial board of ''[[The Orlando Sentinel]]'', have claimed that the bill further perpetuates the theories.

When asked whether or not he believed Obama to be a [[natural born citizen]], Posey remarked that his beliefs on the matter were irrelevant.<ref>[http://blogs.orlandosentinel.com/news_politics/2009/03/posey-future-presidential-candidates-should-show-their-birth-certificates-wont-say-whether-he-believ.html Posey: Future presidential candidates should show their birth certificates; won’t say whether he believes Obama is a US citizen], Orlando Sentinel, March 13, 2009</ref> Posey's bill gained the support of 12 Republican co-sponsors.<ref>Rep. [[Bob Goodlatte]] [VA-6] - 5/5/2009, Rep. [[John R. Carter]] [TX-31] - 6/12/2009, Rep. [[John Abney Culberson|John Culberson]] [TX-7] - 6/12/2009, Rep. [[Randy Neugebauer]] [TX-19] - 6/12/2009, Rep. [[John B. T. Campbell III|John Campbell]] [CA-48] - 6/17/2009, Rep. [[Marsha Blackburn]] [TN-7] - 6/26/2009, Rep. [[Ted Poe]] [TX-2] - 7/7/2009, Rep. [[Dan Burton]] [IN-5] - 7/7/2009, Rep [[Kenny Marchant]] [TX-24] - 7/9/2009, Rep. [[Louie Gohmert]] [TX-1] - 7/28/2009, Rep. [[Trent Franks]] - 9/9/2009, Rep. [[Mike Conaway]] - 4/28/2010</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01503:@@@P |title=Bill Summary & Status - 111th Congress (2009 - 2010) - H.R.1503 - Cosponsors - THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

On June 13, 2014, Posey wrote an op-ed in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' arguing that the [[Autism CARES Act of 2014]] needed to be rewritten and improved.<ref name=PoseyOpEd>{{cite news|last1=Posey|first1=Bill|title=Fix the Combating Autism Act|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/healthcare/209310-fix-the-combating-autism-act|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=13 June 2014}}</ref> Posey argued that, after a federal program spent eight years and $1.7 billion dollars trying to address the autism crisis and failed to do so, Washington was "on a path to rush through a five-year reauthorization, raise spending 20 percent and hope for better results without addressing fundamental structural flaws in the current program."<ref name="PoseyOpEd"/> According to Posey, one flaw with the current system is that while the Interagency Autism Coordinating Committee is charged with writing a strategic plan for organizing the research and spending on autism, the federal government ignores that strategy to have the National Institutes of Health instead, resulting in money being spend in a disjointed manner.<ref name="PoseyOpEd"/> Posey argued that he would like to take the time to improve this bill, possibly using some of the improvements suggested by the Autism Reform Policy Coalition, instead of moving forward too hastily with this bill.<ref name="PoseyOpEd"/>
