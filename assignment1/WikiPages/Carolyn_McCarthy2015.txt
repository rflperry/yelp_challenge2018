After the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] expired in September 2004, McCarthy introduced the [[Assault Weapons Ban and Law Enforcement Protection Act of 2007]] to reauthorize it in February 2007. McCarthy's proposed act would ban 65 models of firearms, as opposed to the 19 models banned under the earlier law. In addition, McCarthy's law would ban any semiautomatic rifle, shotgun, or handgun that was "originally designed for military or law enforcement use, or a firearm based on the design of such a firearm, that is not particularly suitable for sporting purposes, as determined by the Attorney General." However, the bill also included language that stated "a firearm shall not be determined to be particularly suitable for sporting purposes solely because the firearm is suitable for use in a sporting event" - possibly an attempt to rebut those that would argue that several of the firearms proposed to be banned are used in the national rifle matches held at [[Camp Perry]] each year.<ref name="h110">GovTrack.us.

On the April 18, 2007, episode of MSNBC's program [[Tucker (television program)|Tucker]], Tucker Carlson interviewed McCarthy about the [[Virginia Tech massacre]] and her proposed reauthorization of the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]]. He asked her to explain the need to regulate [[barrel shroud]]s, one of the many provisions included in her bill. She did not directly respond, instead stating it was more important that the legislation would ban [[Magazine (firearms)#High capacity magazines|large capacity "clips"]] (sic) of the type used in the Virginia Tech massacre and that the class of guns chosen prohibited by the law were those used by [[gang]]s and killers of police officers. That statement was factually incorrect; Cho's largest magazines held fifteen rounds, thus making them illegal under the AWB.<ref>http://www.governor.virginia.gov/TempContent/techPanelReport-docs/10%20CHAPTER%20VI%20GUN%20PURCHASE%20AND%20CAMPUS%20GUN%20POLICIES.pdf</ref> When Carlson pressed her twice more on the question about barrel shrouds, she admitted that she did not know what a barrel shroud was, and incorrectly stated, "I believe it is a shoulder thing that goes up."

However, local Republican officials showed no support for her candidacy.<ref name="NYT110796" /> So, with the support of the local and national Democratic parties, and the endorsement of ''[[Newsday]]'', the local daily newspaper, McCarthy ran as a Democrat and defeated Frisa by seventeen points.<ref>{{cite web

Before the election, it was reported that Democrats were concerned that McCarthy was in danger of losing her seat.<ref name="NYDN McCarthy">{{cite news|title=New York Democrats anxious as Long Island Rep.

Earlier in 2010, it was widely reported that McCarthy was considering entering the [[United States Senate special election in New York, 2010|2010 special senatorial election]] to challenge Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], owing to the latter's support for gun rights.<ref>{{cite news |author=Danny Hakim |author2=Nicholas Confessore |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/nyregion/24senator.html |title=Paterson Picks Gillibrand for Senate Seat |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 2009 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/northeast/view/2009_01_23_New_York_pol_fumes_over_Senate_choice/ "New York pol fumes over Senate choice", ''The Boston Herald'']{{dead link|date=July 2013}}</ref> Gillibrand had been appointed to the seat on January 23, 2009 by Governor [[David Paterson]] to succeed [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]], who had left the Senate to become Secretary of State in the new [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]]. McCarthy commented, saying: "I've spent 15 years trying to prevent gun violence in this country, and if he [Paterson] does pick her [Gillibrand] and if no one goes and primaries her, I will primary her." She said she would not let New York be represented by someone with a 100% rating of the NRA. On Hardball, McCarthy said that she thought Gillibrand was working for the NRA.<ref name="150 minutes">{{cite news|title=150 Minutes With Carolyn McCarthy|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/54343/|newspaper=NY News and Feature}}</ref>  On June 4, 2009, however, McCarthy announced that she would not mount a primary challenge to Gillibrand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kleefeld |first=Eric |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/06/mccarthy-not-challenging-gillibrand-in-2010-senate-primary.php |title=McCarthy Not Challenging Gillibrand In 2010 Senate Primary &#124; TPMDC |publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]] |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>
