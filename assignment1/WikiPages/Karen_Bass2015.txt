Bass was criticized{{By whom|date=October 2013}} for the following statement to [[Los Angeles Times]] reporter [[Patt Morrison]]: "The Republicans were essentially threatened and terrorized against voting for revenue. Now [some] are facing recalls. They operate under a terrorist threat: 'You vote for revenue and your career is over.' I don't know why we allow that kind of terrorism to exist. I guess it's about free speech, but it's extremely unfair."<ref>{{cite news

Bass has been against general Budget-Wide Cuts like Resolution 38 which would reduce spending to 2008 levels. She has also opposed budgets with deep cuts like the 2011 Budget. However, she has supported the H Amendment 16 for Reducing Navy and Air Force Appropriations. She has supported mainly military cuts.

Bass has supported keeping taxes low for the middle class and “tax credits for small businesses to hire new employees”. She states that the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest should expire because “the wealthy…don’t need these breaks”.<ref name="votesmart" /><ref>{{cite web|title=Jobs & the Economy|publisher=Karen Bass|url=http://bass.house.gov/issue/economy|accessdate=2014-02-15}}</ref>
