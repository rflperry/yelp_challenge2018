Born in [[Bridgeton, New Jersey]], LoBiondo attended [[Georgetown Preparatory School]], and received a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Business Administration from [[Saint Joseph's University]] in [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. He worked for twenty-six years in a family-owned trucking company.

==Early political career==
LoBiondo served on the [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] from 1985 to 1987.
