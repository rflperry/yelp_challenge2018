;Fundraising
According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Bill Foster received $637,050 from labor related political action committees during his runs for Congress. $180,000 of this money came from PACs linked to public sector unions. $110,000 of these donations came from PACs linked to industrial labor unions.

According to the Federal Election Commission, [[Nancy Pelosi]] gave $4,000 to Bill Foster’s 2012 campaign committee. PACs under the control of Pelosi have donated $10,000 to his 2012 campaign.

;Taxes
Foster supports allowing the Bush tax cuts to expire. During a debate with his opponent in the 2012 election Foster said, “The tax cuts were promised to generate job growth, but did not. If you follow the money, when you give a dollar to a very wealthy person, they won’t typically put it back into the local economy.” He said the tax benefits ended up in overseas accounts and spent on luxury purchases.<ref>{{cite web
