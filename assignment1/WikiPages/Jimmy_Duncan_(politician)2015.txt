==Early life, education, and legal career==
Duncan was born in [[Lebanon, Tennessee]]. His "paternal grandparents were small farmers in [[Scott County, Tennessee|Scott County]], which in 1861 left Tennessee, refusing to follow the Volunteer State into the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], and declared itself 'the Free and Independent [[state of Scott]].'"<ref name=Kauffman>[[Bill Kauffman|Kauffman, Bill]] (2005-09-12) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2005/sep/12/00011/ Volunteer Statesman], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref> Duncan's parents were Lois (Swisher) and [[John Duncan, Sr.]], who "hitchhiked into [[Knoxville, Tennessee|Knoxville]] with five dollars in his pocket,' and after an education at the [[University of Tennessee]] was elected mayor of Knoxville and then congressman."<ref name=Kauffman/> The elder Duncan was also a co-owner of the [[Tennessee Smokies|Knoxville Smokies]] of the "[[Southern League (baseball)|Sally League]]," for which his son "was a batboy, a ball shagger, scoreboard operator, and, as a freshman at the University of Tennessee, the Smokies’ public-address announcer."<ref name=Kauffman/> Duncan also worked as a grocery bagger and salesman at [[Sears]] while working his way through school. Duncan supported [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[United States presidential election, 1964|1964]] presidential campaign, and sent the first paycheck he earned as a bagboy at the local [[A&P]] to the Goldwater campaign.<ref name=Kauffman/>

Duncan graduated from the [[University of Tennessee at Knoxville]] in 1969 with a [[Bachelor of Journalism]] degree and subsequently received a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from [[George Washington University Law School]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] in 1973 and was admitted to the [[bar (law)|bar]] that same year. He also served in the [[United States National Guard|Army National Guard]] from 1970 to 1987. He was an [[Lawyer|attorney]] in private practice until he became a state court [[judge]] in [[Knox County, Tennessee]], where he served from 1981 to 1988.

The Lincoln Memorial University Duncan School of Law in Knoxville, TN was named after Jimmy Duncan.<ref>http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/jan/19/judge-denies-lmus-request-to-force-aba-removal/#comments</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
He was first elected to [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in 1988, in a [[special election]] to succeed his late father, [[John Duncan, Sr.]] and elected to the seat for a full term in his own right the same day. He has been re-elected every two years since then from a district that has been held continuously by Republicans (or their antecedents) since 1859, and by a Duncan since his father was first elected in 1964.<ref name=Kauffman/> He has never faced a serious or well-funded challenge for reelection, and was reelected without major-party opposition from 1994 through 2000.

===Tenure===
Duncan voted against authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|War in Iraq]] based on opposition to what he believed to be an unnecessary foreign involvement. He also opposed and voted against a June 2006 House declaration in support of the war.<ref>[http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/nationworld/2003067352_vote17.html NWSource.com]</ref> He was one of the most [[conservatism|conservative]] Republicans to do so.<ref name="VoteSmart">[http://www.vote-smart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=H3711103&type=category&category=Conservative Vote-smart.org]</ref> Duncan later remarked that the [[Iraq War]] vote had been

{{cquote|a tough one for me. I have a very conservative Republican district. My Uncle Joe is one of the most respected judges in Tennessee: when I get in a really serious bind I go to him for advice. I had breakfast with him and my two closest friends and all three told me that I had to vote for the war. It’s the only time in my life that I’ve ever gone against my Uncle Joe’s advice. When I pushed that button to vote against the war back in 2002, I thought I might be ending my political career.<ref name=Kauffman/>}}

Duncan and [[Ron Paul]] were the only two Republicans to vote against funding for the [[Iraq War]] on May 24, 2007.<ref>{{cite news |first=John |last=Bresnahan |url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/05/25/politics/politico/thecrypt/main2852390.shtml |title=McNerney Takes Tough Vote On The War |work=CBS News |publisher=[[The Politico]] |date=2007-05-25}}</ref> Duncan voted, along with three other Republicans, to withdraw U.S. troops from Iraq by April 2008 on July 12, 2007.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll624.xml</ref>

On March 10, 2010, Duncan again joined three other Republicans in voting for the removal of troops from Afghanistan.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll098.xml</ref> Duncan and Paul were the only members of Congress to vote for the removal of troops from Afghanistan and against all recent bailout and stimulus bills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rlc.org/2009/03/26/17-courageous/ |title=17 courageous Congressmen voted against all bailouts &#124; Republican Liberty Caucus |publisher=Rlc.org |date=2009-03-26 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref>
