'''Leon Acton "Lynn" Westmoreland''' (born April 2, 1950) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Georgia|3|}}, serving since 2007. He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. The district stretches from the far southern [[Atlanta]] suburbs to the suburbs of [[Columbus, Georgia|Columbus]]. He previously represented [[Georgia's 8th congressional district]] from 2005 to 2007.

==Early life, education and career==
Westmoreland was born in Atlanta, Georgia, the son of Margaret Ferrell (n√©e Lawson) and Leon Acton Westmoreland.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/westmoreland.htm</ref> He grew up in metro Atlanta. He has no degree beyond a high school diploma. He attended [[Georgia State University]], but dropped out to work in a family construction business in which he later became an executive. He served in the [[Georgia House of Representatives]] from 1993 to 2005, rising to the position of House Republican Leader in 2001. He held that position until 2003 when he stepped down in order to devote time to his Congressional campaign in late 2003. He continued to serve in the Georgia House until his election to the U.S. House in 2005.

As Republican Leader in the Georgia House, he led the fight against intense partisan [[gerrymandering]] during the redistricting process controlled by the Democratic majority in 2001. He was instrumental in the mid-decade redistricting that took place in 2005 after Republicans won control of the Georgia legislature in the 2004 elections.<ref name=WashTimes>{{cite news |url=http://images.washtimes.com/national/20050225-111610-4014r.htm |title=Election districts drawing attention |publisher=The Washington Times |date=February 26, 2005 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20061101011854/http://images.washtimes.com/national/20050225-111610-4014r.htm |archivedate=November 1, 2006}}</ref><ref name="NYT">http://www.nytimes.com/2007/12/20/us/20murphy.html</ref><ref>[http://times-georgian.com/view/full_story/3278580/article-Georgia--Carroll--Haralson-remember-Tom-Murphy Times-Georgian - Georgia Carroll Haralson remember Tom Murphy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Tenure===
During his first term in the [[109th United States Congress]], Westmoreland was appointed to the [[U.S. House Committee on Small Business]], [[U.S. House Committee on Government Reform]], and the [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

As a U.S. congressman, Westmoreland cosponsored a bill to place the [[Ten Commandments]] in the House of Representatives and the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. Westmoreland also sponsored a bill that the Ten Commandments could be displayed in courthouses in a historical setting.<ref name=11alive>{{cite news|url=http://www.11alive.com/news/news_article.aspx?storyid=43064|title=GOP Intros 10 Commandments Bill|agency=Associated Press}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> In May 2006, political humorist [[Stephen Colbert]] interviewed Westmoreland for ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' show segment ''[[Better Know a District]]'', and during the interview, asked Westmoreland to name the Ten Commandments. The edited interview showed Westmoreland being able to name only three of them, but his press secretary later said that he had named seven of the ten.<ref name=cnn>[http://www.cnn.com/2008/SHOWBIZ/TV/06/09/tv.stephencolbert.ap/index.html Just who is this 'Stephen Colbert' character?]{{dead link|date=December 2012}}, June 9, 2008, [[CNN]].</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2006/oct/22/business/fi-colbert22 Running for office? Better run from Colbert] October 22, 2006, [[Los Angeles Times]].</ref> Govtrack.us ranked Westmoreland as tied for the most conservative member of the [[112th Congress]]

Westmoreland led a group of congressmen who opposed the 2006 renewal of certain provisions in the [[Voting Rights Act]] that require nine Southern states and a number of counties (mostly in the South) to obtain Federal permission for certain changes to election law or changes in venue.  Westmoreland and his colleagues claimed that it was no longer fair to target their states, given the passage of time since 1965 and the changes their states had made to provide fair elections and voting.  Despite Westmoreland's objections, a strong bipartisan majority renewed the Voting Rights Act for another 25 years without changes.<ref name="cbsnews">{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/14/ap/politics/mainD8IRNHO85.shtml|title=House Renews Voting Rights Act Unchanged|publisher=''CBS News''|accessdate=2008-08-29|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080427042841/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/07/14/ap/politics/mainD8IRNHO85.shtml|archivedate=2008-04-27}}</ref>

In 2008, Westmoreland ran unopposed in the Republican primary and was re-elected after defeating his Democratic opponent Stephen Camp.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.times-herald.com/local/Westmoreland-retains-seat-582222|title=Westmoreland retains seat|accessdate=2008-11-06|last=Pedraza-Vidamour|first=Brenda|date=2008-11-04|publisher=[[Newnan Times-Herald]]}}</ref> After his win, Westmoreland announced that he was considering running for the office of [[List of governors of Georgia|Governor of Georgia]] in 2010,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ajc.com/gwinnett/content/metro/stories/2008/11/05/housega_incumbents.html|title=Georgia House incumbents win their races|accessdate=13 November 2008|last=Smith|first=Ben|date=2008-11-05|work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]]|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref> but later indicated in an April 2009 press release that he would not.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ajc.com/metro/content/metro/stories/2009/04/24/westmoreland_georgia_governor.html?cxntlid=homepage_tab_newstab|title=Westmoreland won't run for governor|publisher=''The Atlanta Journal-Constitution''|accessdate=2009-07-28}}{{dead link|date=December 2012}}</ref>

In 2010 Westmoreland signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/08/westmoreland.pdf</ref>

==Controversy==
On September 4, 2008, Westmoreland described [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic]] presidential nominee [[Barack Obama]] and his wife [[Michelle Obama|Michelle]] as "[[wiktionary:uppity|uppity]]," a pejorative considered by some as historically used to describe African-Americans who have made economic, social, or political progress.<ref name="LATimes">[http://www.latimes.com/news/opinion/la-oe-shipler16apr16,0,2335261.story The Resonance of Racism], April 16, 2008, ''[[Los Angeles Times]].''</ref> He told reporters: "Just from what little I‚Äôve seen of her and Mr. Obama, Senator Obama, they're a member of an elitist-class individual that thinks that they're uppity," Westmoreland said. Asked to clarify that he used the word "uppity," Westmoreland said, "Uppity, yeah."<ref name="HILL">[http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/westmoreland-calls-obama-uppity-2008-09-04.html Westmoreland Calls Obama Uppity], September 4, 2008, [[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]].</ref><ref>[http://www.cqpolitics.com/cq-assets/cqmultimedia/audio/uppity.mp3 Audio recording of Rep. Westmoreland referring to Obamas as "uppity"]</ref>

The ensuing media attention compelled Westmoreland to issue the following statement: "I‚Äôve never heard that term used in a racially derogatory sense. It is important to note that the dictionary definition of 'uppity' is 'affecting an air of inflated self-esteem‚Äîsnobbish.' That's what we meant by uppity when we used it in the mill village where I grew up."<ref name=autogenerated1>{{cite news|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/washington/2008/09/rep-westmorelan.html|work=The Los Angeles Times|title=Top of the Ticket|date=September 5, 2008}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Westmoreland won a plurality of votes in the Republican primary election in 2004, but faced fellow Republican Dylan Glenn in a runoff. Westmoreland received 55.5% of the vote in the runoff. The district was so heavily Republican that Westmoreland's primary victory was [[tantamount to election]] in November. He routed his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, businesswoman Silvia Delamar, with almost 76% of the vote. He was handily reelected in 2006 after his district was renumbered as the 3rd and made even more Republican than before.

==Personal life==
He resides in [[Grantville, Georgia]], with his wife, Joan; they have three children and seven grandchildren.
