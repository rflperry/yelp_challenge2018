        <!------------- INTRODUCTION ------------->
        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Yelp is a company founded in 2004 that allows users of its website, Yelp.com, 
		or its mobile app to review and rate businesses ranging from restaurants to home services. It has become 
		extremely popular, with over 100 million unique users visiting its services per month during Q3 2018 and 
		generating more than 171 million reviews. Businesses have profiles and can respond to reviews but cannot 
		influence nor change the content of the reviews. Yelp recommends the reviews it deems best and most reliable 
		and has become a strong influence on the success of restaurants [3].</p>
		
		<p style='text-align: justify;'>Yelp’s goal is ‘to connect people with great local businesses.’ To better 
		achieve this, they established the Yelp Elite Squad (YES), composed of the most avid of Yelp’s users. In 
		order to join, an individual must be nominated and then selected, on the basis of a set of nondescript and 
		subjective criteria. They must then maintain this status, as it only is guaranteed for a year [5].</p>

        <!------------- DATA STORY ------------->
        <h2>Data Story and Aims of the Analysis</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'> The purpose of our project is to supplement Yelp’s subjective description of the 
		of an elite user with quantitative analysis. Yelp states that elite users are “people who are active in the Yelp 
		community and role models” and that selection is based on “well-written reviews, high quality tips, a detailed 
		personal profile, an active voting and complimenting record, and a history of playing well with others” [4]. 
		There are not many further descriptions of what it takes to be selected as an elite user, and no specific 
		quantitative thresholds or measures to meet.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The first aspect of our analysis attempts to quantify the description of elite 
		users being “active in the Yelp community” and “playing well with others” [4]. To do so, we examine the role of 
		elite users in the friendship network of Yelp. Yelp users can “friend” other users on the site and these connections 
		can be modeled in a graph. We hypothesize that elite users will display a greater number of connections and a greater 
		degree of centrality and importance in the graph, characteristics that reflect Yelp’s subjective description.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The second aspect of our analysis attempts to quantify aspects of the description that 
		elite users have “well-written reviews” [4]. Although this is quite broad, we attempt to quantify some aspects of it by 
		examining the sentiment expressed in the reviews as well as how the use of language differs. We hypothesize that elite 
		users will use more descriptive and sophisticated language as well as show more measured emotion in their words.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>For this project, the focus was on restaurants in Toronto as Toronto is a big
            city
            with
            more than a sufficient amount
            of data to perform a serious analysis, but
            small enough for various graph algorithms to be carried out. The reviews and users considered in this
            project
            were
            those pertaining to a restaurant in Toronto.</p>

        <!------------- DATASET ------------->
        <h2>The Dataset Used</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>
            The dataset is a subset of the <a href="https://www.yelp.com/dataset/challenge">YELP
                dataset challenge 2018</a> dataset
            and contains YELP review data from the period 2004 to 2018, where the majority of the reviews are made in
            North
            America.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The datasets are split into 3, namely the review, user and restaurant dataset,
            which can be downloaded via
            the links below (right click, and select "Save link as"). The review dataset had to split into 4 subsets,
            in order for GitHub to host it, since
            individual file sizes may not exceed 100 MB.</p>

        <h3>Brief Overview for the Toronto Dataset</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Period: March 1st, 2008 to August 1st, 2018</li>
            <li>Reviews: ~380,000</li>
            <li>Users: ~95,000</li>
            <li>Elite users hereof: ~7500</li>
            <li>Restaurants: ~10,000</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Prior Work</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>This analysis of elite users in the Yelp community is largely inspired by a
            technical report from Stanford [1] which investigated elite users in Phoenix, Arizona, and included, what
            they called, a ‘taste’ network which grouped Yelp users based on their taste in restaurants. Our analysis
            will not include this feature, but it will, however, draw from some of their points, such as investigating
            how big of a role the elite users play in the social network, as well in a network of Yelp reviews.
        </p>

        <!------------- SOCIAL NETWORK ANALYSIS ------------->
        <h2>Yelp's Social Network in Toronto</h2>
        <img style="margin:auto; width:70%;display:block" src="graphics/friends_graphx.svg">

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Two users may choose to become on Yelp, for example, if they share interests.
            This feature is very analogous
            to that of the social network of Facebook, and even has the same limit on the number of friends each user
            can have, which is 5000.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>A big part of this analysis involves analyzing the influence of Elite users in
            Yelp’s
            social network. A social graph was built from the review dataset, with all the users who left one or more
            reviews on a Toronto restaurant's Yelp page. These users were inserted in a network, as well as all the
            users appearing in their respective friendlists, and an edge was drawn between each pair of friends.

            The resulting network is an undirected social graph, with a total of 95,000 nodes and 380,000 edges. The
            size of the network meant that some of the algorithms took a considerable amount of time to run. An
            alternative to including all of the 95,000
            nodes would be to only consider the nodes which had left a review in Toronto, even for the friendlist,
            which was also done but will in the groups opinion less success. The resulting network of including only
            friends who left a review in Toronto was a network with Nodes: 13,600 nodes and 9,400 edges.</p>

        <h3>Social Network Degree Distribution</h3>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The nodes of the social network all represent Yelp users, which are either
            regular users or Elite users.
            For understanding how the distribution of friends looks like, the degree distribution for all nodes, Elite
            nodes and regular user nodes was plotted. From the distributions it becomes apparent that a power law
            governs the number of friends of the Yelp users; an exponentially large part of the users have very few
            friends, and for the regular users this number is down to one single friend.

        <h3>Centrality Measures for the Social Network</h3>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>For understanding the roles of the nodes in the network, two centrality
            measures were used: degree
            centrality and eigenvalue centrality. The degree centrality speaks to how popular a node is in the network,
            in this case, how many friends a user has. The eigenvalue centrality represents how popular the friends of
            a
            particular node is, i.e. their friend count.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>For the social network, these two measures are for the most part correlated,
            which makes intuitive sense
            since having more friends increases the chance of having popular friends.</p>

        <h3>Robustness Analysis</h3>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>
            To quantify the influence of the Elite users in the social network, an experiment was conducted wherein a
            fraction
            of users corresponding to 1 percent of the Elite user base was removed in each iteration, until a number of
            users
            equal to the number of Elite users, was removed. The social network contained just under 7500 Elite users,
            meaning
            that 75 users were removed in each iteration. The largest connected component was calculated for each
            iteration,
            which tells us how many users are actually part of the social network, and those that were only connected
            to the
            social network via an Elite user which was removed will no longer be part of the largest connected
            component.
        </p>

        <img src="./plots/robustness_plot.svg" />

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>
            The figure tells us that by removing all Elite users from the network, the total number of nodes in the
            social
            network drops to around 65% of the original size, while only around 0.5% of the total number of nodes were
            removed.
            For removing regular users only, we see that the network size drops by around 4% after removing 7500 users,
            and
            for
            random users, i.e. a mix of both Elite and regular users, the resulting loss of network size is around 5%.
        </p>


        <h4>Robustness Analysis of the Smaller Social Network</h4>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The aforementioned smaller social network was also run through the robustness
            analysis, and the results were
            very analogous to those of the bigger network, except the smaller network was more susceptible to sudden
            huge losses in network size.</p>

        <!------------- REVIEW NETWORK ANALYSIS ------------->
        <h2>Yelp Review Network Analysis</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'> A review is made when a user reviews a business, a business referring to a
            restaurant and other service places. A review contains a rating of 1 to 5 stars, as well as a written
            statement,
            which is used to clarify the given rating.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>For our analyses, we aim to build a network of reviews and a social network of
            who are friends with who on Yelp, as well as analyze the review text to discern what, if any, differences
            exist between Elite and regular users as well as between reviews of different stars.</p>

        <!-- END: REVIEWS DEGREE DIST -->

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Very clear example of a power law, with the overwhelming majority of users
            having reviewed extremely few
            restaurants. Users are only included if they have in fact reviewed a restaurant in Toronto, meaning the
            spike is likely at 1 single review.

            The degree distribution for the Elite users in Toronto is unsurprisingly also a power law, with most users
            having left a single review. However, the distribution is somewhat less dense around one single review,
            compared to the
            review distribution for overall users. Below is shown the distrubtion, but on a logarithmic scale.

        <!-- END: DELTAS CAROUSEL -->

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Elite users are somewhat representative of the reviews made by all users, of
            which they make up a 38
            percent. This means the data set is only reduced by less than a third, however, the user count is reduced
            from 95k to 7.5k. This may be useful if one were to perform trend analyses, and the task of tracking all
            users in the network was overwhelming - instead it would make a lot of sense to start looking at the Elite
            users, first and foremost.</p>


        <h3>Rating Distribution</h3>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The second component of our work was analyzing the text present in the reviews.
            As
            previously states, there are
            approximately 380,000 reviews of Toronto restaurants. These reviews are dated and thus we can determine if
            a
            user
            was Elite when they made a review. Before beginning with any text analysis, it is relevant to check how
            Elite
            and
            regular users differ in the distribution of the number of stars they award. If one assumes that most
            restaurants
            are
            in some middle tier, with some much better and some worse, we would expect to see a distribution resembling
            a
            bell
            curve. </p>

        <img style="margin:auto; width:70%;display:block" src="./plots/review_dist.svg" />

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>As we can see, the Elite users mostly give four or three-star reviews, although
            the
            distribution is shifted to the
            higher reviews. In contrast, we notice that the regular users have a rating distribution more resembling an
            inverse
            bell curve. The highest fraction comes from five-star reviews and then it decreases down to two stars and
            finally
            rises slightly with one-star reviews having a greater fraction than two-star reviews. This may indicate, or
            conform
            to preconceived notions, that regular users are not as good at distinguishing mid-tier restaurants and are
            so
            skew
            their ratings higher or lower.
        </p>

        <!------------- REVIEW TEXT ANALYSIS ------------->
        <h2>Review Text Analysis</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Beginning our text analysis, we investigated how word choice compares between
            Elite
            and non-Elite users and across
            star ratings using TF-IDF scores. A TF-IDF (term frequency-inverse document frequency) score for a given
            word
            and
            the document is large if the word appears frequently in the document but infrequently across all documents.
            Thus,
            the
            higher the TF-IDF score, the more important and unique a word is to the specific document. The TF-IDF
            results
            are
            visualized in the generated word clouds.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>As we can see, words of praise and negativity strongly associate with 5 star
            and 1
            star reviews, respectively.</p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>We also examined the length of the reviews written, excluding common English
            stopwords such as ‘as’, ‘the’, etc.
            There is clearly a slight downward trend, with lower ratings yielding longer reviews. The Elite users also
            clearly
            write more than the regular users, which makes sense given their status.</p>


        <h3>Sentiment Analysis</h3>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>A sentiment analysis aims to determine the attitude of a speaker, writer, or
            other subject with respect to
            some document of words, where each word maps to a given sentiment score. For our sentiment analysis, the
            sentiment score used, was the labMT 1.0 dictionary, containing sentiment scores for over 10,000 words [2].
        </p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>For the Yelp reviews, the sentiment score seems to be correlated with the
            review length, but what we are
            more
            interested in are the trends in review sentiment. Therefore, the reviews were partitioned on their average
            sentiment into three categories:
            <ul>
                <li>Those below one standard deviation of the average sentiment</li>
                <li>Those above one standard deviation</li>
                <li>Those in between</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Firstly, it appears that the low sentiment decreases and the high sentiment
            increases as the number of stars of a review increases, which is unsurprising given the previous word cloud
            analysis.
        </p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>Furthermore, the above figure also reveals that the mid-tier sentiment
            decreases, which would indicated that
            high star reviews yield more extreme sentiment. However, there does not appear to be a significant
            difference between the sentiment per star when comparing the elite to the regular users. Thus, there do
            seem to be some global trends in sentiment, but the trends are global and don’t discriminate between the
            two user types.</p>

        <h2>Results and Conclusion</h2>
        <p style='text-align: justify;'>As stated earlier, the first goal of this project was to test Yelp’s claims
            about the characteristics of their Elite users. One claim that they made was that Elite users have high
            social connectivity. Our results validate this claim with reasonable confidence. On the social network,
            Elite users are greatly overrepresented among the top degree nodes: 57% of Elite nodes are in the top 20%
            of nodes in terms of degree. Also, the average degree of Elite nodes (8.58) is significantly higher than
            the network average
            (2.46).
            Another claim that they made is that Elite users contribute greatly to the site. Our results validate this
            claim with very high confidence. Elite users are greatly overrepresented among the top reviewers: about 80%
            of Elite users are in the top 20% of users in terms of reviews written. In addition, the average number of
            reviews written for Elite users is significantly higher than Yelp users as a whole (250 vs. 36).
        </p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The last claim we tested was that the Elite users make up the “heart of the
            Yelp community.” From both a
            social and taste perspective, our results also validate this claim with reasonable confidence. First of
            all, the robustness of the social network is much more affected by removing Elite nodes than random nodes
            (the size of the largest CC decreased more than twice as fast), which suggests that these Elite nodes are
            important for maintaining the structure of the social network. In addition, the Elite nodes are
            overrepresented among the top users in terms of being central to the graph (betweenness centrality), being
            an “important” node in the sense of having high PageRank, and also being directly connected to multiple
            communities. The fact that Elite nodes have much greater values for these properties than the network as a
            whole further substantiates the claim.
            In the taste network, though, removing Elite nodes had a much smaller effect on the robustness of the
            graph. This indicates that Elites are more vital to the social network than the taste network. However,
            Elites are still more important to the structure of the taste network than non-Elites. The importance of
            Elites were verified by our results for PageRank, betweenness centrality, and direct connectedness to
            communities. Elites were over-represented among the top percentiles for these three measures. In general,
            the values of these properties were significantly higher for Elites than non-Elites.
        </p>

        <p style='text-align: justify;'>The second goal of our project was to determine which property was the most
            indicative of Elite status. As mentioned earlier, the Elite users were greatly overrepresented in the top
            reviewers on Yelp, much more so than for any of the other properties. In addition, Elite users post on
            average seven times as many reviews as the average user. This very strong association suggests that out of
            the properties we have measured,
            having a very large number of reviews is the best indication of Elite status. This conclusion implies that
            the number of reviews a user has written would likely be a good predictor of Eliteness. In addition,
            writing many reviews could be a good objective for those who are looking to become Elite.
