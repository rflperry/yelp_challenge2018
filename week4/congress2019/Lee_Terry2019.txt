==Early life==
Terry was born in [[Omaha, Nebraska]], the son of Mary Chalone (née Courtney) and Leland Roy Terry.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.legacy.com/obituaries/name/mary-markham-obituary?pid=1000000170243109|title=Mary Markham Obituary - Omaha, Nebraska|first=|last=admin|date=18 March 2014|website=Legacy.com|accessdate=4 April 2018}}</ref> He graduated from [[Omaha Northwest High School]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1998
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections, 1998#Nebraska}}
In 1998, incumbent Republican Representative [[Jon Lynn Christensen]] retired to run for [[governor of Nebraska]]. Terry ran to succeed him, winning the Republican primary with a plurality, 40%, in a three-way race. Attorney Steve Kupka came second with 30%, businessman Brad Kuiper came third with 27% and three other candidates took the remaining 4%. In the general election, Terry defeated Democratic nominee Michael Scott, a television anchor, 67% to 34%.

;2000–2004
In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2000#Nebraska|2000]], Terry defeated Democratic State Senator Shelley Kiel, 66% to 31%. In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2002#Nebraska|2002]], he defeated Democratic businessman Jim Simon, 63% to 33%. In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2004#Nebraska|2004]], he defeated Democratic State Senator [[Nancy Thompson (Senator)|Nancy Thompson]], 61% to 36%.

;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nebraska, 2006#District 2}}
In 2006, he faced his first primary contest since 1998, defeating Steven Laird, who had run against Terry in 1998 and taken 1% in the primary. Terry defeated him again, 84% to 16%. In the general election, Lee faced Democratic businessman [[Jim Esch]]. In an election that saw Democrats [[United States elections, 2006|make sweeping gains]] and retake control of the House after 12 years of a Republican majority, Terry defeated Esch by just 55% to 45%.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nebraska, 2008#District 2}}
In 2008, Terry faced another primary challenge from Steven Laird, defeating him by 84% to 16%. He also faced a rematch in the general election against [[Jim Esch]]. The election was concurrent with the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 presidential election]]. Nebraska is one of two states that uses the [[Congressional District Method]] in presidential elections: the winner of the statewide popular vote receives two electoral votes and the winner in each congressional district receives one vote. The Democratic nominee, [[Barack Obama]], therefore targeted the district in case the Electoral College was otherwise tied.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2008/09/10/politics/main4436261.shtml?source=RSSattr=Politics_4436261 "Obama Camp Targets Omaha: Obama Makes A Play In Nebraska, One Of Only Two States That Can Split It's Electoral Votes"], [[CBS]].

May 27, 2008.</ref> That effort made Terry even more vulnerable. ''CQ Politics'' forecast the race as 'Leans Republican', ''The Cook Political Report'' ranked it 'Republican Toss-Up' and ''The Rothenberg Political Report'' rated it 'Toss-Up/Tilt Democratic'. In response, Terry appealed to Obama supporters, dubbing them "Obama-Terry voters", and emphasizing that he would work with Obama if he won the election.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/10/im-voting-for-o/ "I’m Voting for Obama and Lee Terry"], NBC News.

November 2, 2008.</ref> Ultimately, Terry was reelected by just 52% to 48%.

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nebraska, 2010#District 2}}
In 2010, Terry faced another primary challenge, this one from Matt Sakalosky, a [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] challenger who accused Terry of being "insufficiently conservative". Terry refused to debate him and Sakalosky struggled to raise money but ended up taking 37% of the vote to Terry's 63%.<ref>[http://www.newnebraska.net/diary/2277/is-lee-terry-scared-of-primary-challenger-matt-sakalosky "Is Lee Terry Scared Of Primary Challenger Matt Sakalosky?"], New Nebraska.

In a year that saw the Republicans make [[United States elections, 2010|widespread gains]] and retake the House, Terry defeated White 61% to 39%.

In the primary, he emerged victorious with 59% of the vote. The anti-Terry vote was split between former University of Nebraska football player Brett Lindstrom, who took 23%, and University of Nebraska professor Jack Heidel, with 11%. Glenn Freeman and Paul Anderson took 4% and 2% respectively. After [[redistricting]] following the [[2010 United States Census]], Nebraska Republicans redrew the state's congressional map and made the 2nd district more Republican,<ref>[http://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/09/23/nebraska-g-o-p-draws-a-tougher-map-for-obama/?_r=0 "Nebraska G.O.P.

===Tenure===
When Terry first ran for Congress in 1998, he signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Limited Government]] to limit himself to three terms in office. After winning the primary and general elections, Terry reneged on his promise, saying that he had signed the pledge because "term limits is an important issue and that was the way I wanted to signify my dedication to the issue." He ended up serving eight terms in the House.<ref name=watchdog>{{cite web|url=http://watchdog.org/43627/ne-exclusive-the-congressman-and-his-pledges/|title=The Congressman and His Pledge(s)|first=Joe|last=Jordan|date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=October 15, 2013|work=[[Watchdog.org|Nebraska Watchdog]]}}</ref>

On May 10, 2006, Terry appeared on the [[Better Know a District]] segment of the satirical news program ''[[The Colbert Report]]''. He expressed his longtime support for [[alternative energy]], specifically advocating the development of a [[hydrogen economy]]. Terry later teamed up with [[Stephen Colbert]] to submit an op-ed to the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/aug/07/opinion/oe-terry7|title=Pols for comedy, unite!|author1=Lee Terry|author2=Stephen Colbert|date=August 7, 2006|accessdate=October 15, 2013|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}</ref>

Terry is a staunch advocate of federal prohibition of online [[poker]]. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition and Enforcement Act,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777:|title=Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> and H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411:|title=Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref> Poker rights blogger Rich Muny, a board member of the [[Poker Players Alliance]], rated Terry "F" on support for poker rights. Muny also included him on his "Leach List"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2008/7/9/18386/31372/191/549007|title=Daily Kos, "26 Congressmen Who Are Too Busy Pandering to Focus on the Family to Solve America's Problems", July 9, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=9 October 2014}}</ref>—a list of anti-poker Representatives who are projected to be in tough reelection fights in 2008 (named for former Rep. [[Jim Leach]] (R-IA), sponsor of numerous efforts to ban online poker).

In 2009, Terry was named one of the most bipartisan members of the House of Representatives by ''The Hill'' and was named a "heavyweight" in telecommunications and media policy in the 111th Congress.<ref>http://leeterry.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=806&Itemid={{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

While running for reelection in 2010, Terry, who had previously been a strong supporter of [[Social Security debate in the United States#Pro-privatization arguments|privatizing Social Security]], came out against it. He signed a pledge that he would "oppose any effort to privatize Social Security, in whole or in part."<ref name=watchdog/>

Terry was initially a co-sponsor and supporter of the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]]. Under pressure from internet campaigns, he later rescinded his support for the bill.<ref>{{cite news|last=Masnick|first=Mike|title=First One Down: Rep. Lee Terry Removes His Name As A SOPA Co-Sponsor|url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20120118/02111117450/first-one-down-rep-lee-terry-removes-his-name-as-sopa-co-sponsor.shtml|accessdate=January 23, 2012|newspaper=[[Techdirt]]|date=January 18, 2012}}</ref> Terry voted in favor of the [[Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act]] (CISPA), a bill often compared to SOPA by its critics.

During the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]], Terry refused to give up his salary. He was asked if he would continue to collect his paychecks and replied, "dang straight". He said that he needed his paycheck to pay for his "nice house" and his child's college education, adding that "we cannot handle it. Giving our paycheck away when you still worked and earned it? That's just not going to fly."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/04/lee-terry-government-shutdown-nice-house_n_4044511.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Amanda | last=Terkel | title=Republican Won't Give Up Salary During Shutdown Because He Needs To Pay For His 'Nice House' | date=October 4, 2013}}</ref>
