Turner High School]] in Carrollton and attended college at [[Southern Nazarene University|Southern Nazarene University (SNU)]] in [[Bethany, Oklahoma|Bethany]], [[Oklahoma]], at which he graduated with a [[Business Administration]] degree. He worked as a [[real estate developer]] and he owned a home-building company prior to entering politics.

Marchant served on the Carrollton City Council from 1980 to 1984, and was [[mayor]] of Carrollton from 1984 to 1986, both [[nonpartisan]] positions.

==Political positions==
Marchant worked closely with Bush when he was [[governor of Texas]], and bills himself as a staunch conservative.  However, he has occasionally broken ranks with the GOP, as he did to increase the [[minimum wage]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-mckenzie_20edi.ART.State.Edition1.379bba4.html Works well with others? What a flaw! | Dallas Morning News | News for Dallas, Texas | Opinion: Points<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has said that his top priority on [[Capitol Hill]] will be cutting the federal [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] with [[fiscal conservative]] policies.  The [[Sunlight Foundation]] wrote that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, Marchant has the fifth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog – Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://sunlightfoundation.com/blog/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on July 25, 2016</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Marchant had planned to run for Congress two years earlier in a bid to represent the newly created {{ushr|Texas|32|32nd district}} in suburban Dallas, but fellow Republican [[Pete Sessions]], an incumbent, chose to run there instead. During the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Marchant, in his position on the Texas House's Redistricting Committee, was ideally positioned to help draw Texas districts.  As part of this effort, the 24th District, represented by 13-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Martin Frost]], was reconfigured from a heavily Democratic district with a sizable Latino population into a heavily Republican district that was over 73 percent white.  While [[Al Gore]] easily carried the old 24th in the 2000 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] would have won the new 24th with a staggering 68 percent of the vote.  Marchant was elected to Congress in 2004, and was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast).

Marchant won his seventh term in the House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 154,845 votes (56.2 percent), he defeated the Democrat Jan McDowell, who received 108,389 (39.3 percent). Two other candidates held the remaining 4.5 percent of the ballots cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist319_state.htm|title=Election Results|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=December 17, 2016}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Marchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children as well as four grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kenny|url=http://marchant.house.gov/biography/}}</ref> They live in [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], a Dallas suburb.
Marchant's son [[Matthew Marchant]] is a former mayor of [[Carrollton, Texas]].
