In the 113th Congress, Representative Miller was appointed to serve as Chairman of the [http://cha.house.gov/ Committee on House Administration] (CHA), and in the 114th Congress she continues to serve as the Committee's Chair. CHA was established in 1947 and is charged with the oversight of federal elections and the day-to-day operations of the House of Representatives.

The Committee has the responsibility to ensure that the House of Representatives runs in an effective and efficient manner, which is vital as we work to meet the many challenges facing this great nation.  Most importantly, this committee has jurisdiction over the federal election process, and, as Chairman, Representative Miller has been committed to making certain the Committee enacts rules to ensure our nation continues to have open, free, and fair elections.

Under her leadership as Chairman, the U.S. House received consecutive "clean" audits, demonstrating her commitment to transparency and accountability. She also played a major role in advancing legislation to end the practice of using millions of dollars in taxpayer funding to host political party conventions and, instead, redirected that funding for pediatric research. Working with House officers,  she has helped to increase the availability of low-cost digital tools used by the House to improve the House's daily functions and reduce operating costs. She also oversaw the [http://cha.house.gov/press-release/house-administration-reviews-voting-process-bauer-ginsberg-commission-recommendations Committee’s review of the report generated by the Bauer-Ginsberg Commission], which focused on utilizing good, local governance over elections and made recommendations on different ideas to help locals election administrators improve upon their own voting processes.<ref name="Full Biography"/>

** [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security|Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security]]
Representative Miller has served on the [http://homeland.house.gov/ House Committee on Homeland Security] since March 2008.  Representative Miller is currently serving as Vice Chair of the full House Committee on Homeland Security and served as Chairman of the [http://homeland.house.gov/subcommittee-BMS Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security] from 2011 until February 2016.  She is also serving as a member of the [http://homeland.house.gov/subcommittee-CTI Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence].

The federal government's first and foremost responsibility is to provide for our national defense, and our common defense begins with a secure homeland.  The Committee is charged with oversight of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and ensuring its primary focus remains on the protection of the American people.

As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, Representative Miller exercised effective oversight and initiated legislative efforts to ensure our nation's borders are adequately secured against international terrorist organizations, illegal immigration, drug and human smuggling, as well as the exploitation of the legitimate visa process.

During the 113th Congress, Representative Miller championed legislation to formally authorize Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and clarify the security mission of the agency for the first time since the Department of Homeland Security was created in 2002. The legislation passed the House on July 28, 2014.  She has also long advocated for ways to strengthen the Department of Homeland Security's ability to identify and stop terrorists with western passports, authoring legislation in that would allow DHS to suspend a country's participation in the U.S. Visa Waiver Program if it fails to provide the U.S. with pertinent traveler information related to terror threats. Additionally, Representative Miller crafted legislation to increase oversight over the maritime security mission of DHS, as well as strengthen maritime security at home and abroad as we trade with our trusted partners.

In the 114th Congress, Representative Miller continued to push needed legislation that helped ensure we implement strong protections for our borders and global supply chain.  Our nation's borders can and must be secured, and her goal has been to see that DHS is making progress to confront the threats of terrorism, cyber terrorism, and mismanagement of the Department in these areas vital to our national security, and continuing to work towards a secure border and a safer homeland.

Michigan's 10th Congressional District is a border district.  It is home to the Blue Water Bridge, which is the second-busiest border crossing on the northern tier; Selfridge Air National Guard Base, which has expanding missions in the area of homeland security; Coast Guard stations at Selfridge, Port Huron, and Harbor Beach; it borders Chemical Valley, which is one of the largest collections of petro-chemical operations in North America; the CN Rail Tunnel, which is the busiest rail artery in the U.S.; and is the genesis of important trade arteries, interstates I-94 and I-69.

Miller focused her efforts on building a stronger presence of homeland security assets at Selfridge, enhancing the security of our airways, roadways, railways, and waterways, in addition to securing our food and water supplies by enhancing Northern Border security.

The Committee on Homeland Security was established in 2002 to provide congressional oversight for the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and better protect the American people against a possible terrorist attack.  Many of the programs at Selfridge and the armed service reserves throughout the 10th Congressional District fall under the purview of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security.  The Committee on Homeland Security provides oversight for the department and handles issues dealing with transportation security, border and port security, critical infrastructure protection, cyber security, and science and technology, emergency preparedness, emerging threats, intelligence and information sharing, investigations, and management and procurement.<ref name="Full Biography"/><ref name=":0" />

In 2007, Representative Miller was appointed to the full [http://transportation.house.gov/ House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure].  Representative Miller is also a member of the [https://web.archive.org/web/20130915090121/http://transportation.house.gov/subcommittees/railroads-pipelines-and-hazardous-materials Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials], the [http://transportation.house.gov/subcommittees/subcommittee/?ID=107422 Subcommittee on Water Resources and Environment], as well as the [http://transportation.house.gov/subcommittees/subcommittee/?ID=107417 Subcommittee on Aviation].  Representative Miller is the only member from Michigan serving on this Committee and takes seriously the need to advocate on behalf of Michigan to ensure the state is returned its fair share of tax dollars for many infrastructure needs.  She believes all avenues of transportation, whether on land or on the sea, are important to improve, maintain, and support surrounding economic growth.

Michigan's 10th Congressional District is host to the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron, which is the second most traveled border crossing in North America.  It is a vital component of economic expansion not just for the district, but for the region, state, and nation.  This Committee allows her to offer enhanced oversight and influence to ensure this portal and others like it receive the federal attention they need and deserve.

In 2014, Representative Miller was appointed to the House Committee on Transportation and [http://candicemiller.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-special-panel-releases-final-report-on-p3s Infrastructure’s Public-Private Partnership Special Panel.]  This panel was created to examine the current state of public-private partnerships (P3s) across all modes of transportation, economic development, public buildings, water, and maritime infrastructure and equipment, and make recommendations on balancing the needs of the public and private sectors when considering, developing, and implementing P3 projects to finance the Nation's infrastructure. As the only Michigan Member, her involvement was critical in examining innovative ways that P3s can benefit infrastructure projects in Michigan, such as the expansion of the Customs and Border Plaza at the Blue Water Bridge.

The Committee also holds jurisdiction over water quality issues. Throughout her career in public service, protecting the Great Lakes has been one of Representative Miller's principal advocacies.  She is a vocal proponent of policy designed to preserve and protect Michigan's most cherished natural resource.  During the 113th Congress, as the only member of the Committee from the state of Michigan, Miller tirelessly advocated for the Great Lakes during House and conference negotiations of the Water Resources Reform and Development Act (WRRDA) and secured the inclusion of her provision designating all ports and harbors on the Great Lakes as a single, comprehensive navigation system for budgeting purposes – the Great Lakes Navigation System – essentially allowing the Great Lakes ports and harbors to create a unified front when it comes to federal funding.

The Committee has jurisdiction over all modes of transportation: aviation, maritime and waterborne transportation, highways, bridges, mass transit, and railroads.  The Committee also has jurisdiction over other aspects of our national infrastructure, such as clean water and waste water management, the transport of resources by pipeline, flood damage reduction, the management of federally owned real estate and public buildings, the development of economically depressed rural and urban areas, disaster preparedness and response, and hazardous materials transportation.

The Committee's broad oversight portfolio includes many federal agencies, including the Department of Transportation, the U.S. Coast Guard, Amtrak, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Federal Emergency Management Agency, the General Services Administration, the Army Corps of Engineers, and others.<ref name="Full Biography"/>

For the 110th Congress Miller was appointed to continue her service on the [[House Armed Services Committee]] and was added to the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, which has jurisdiction over not only surface transportation but also water quality issues related to the Great Lakes. Miller was appointed to the House Committee on Homeland Security in March 2008 and has since left the House Armed Services Committee.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

==Admonishment by House Ethics Committee==

During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote.

{{quote|The subcommittee released a 62-page report... that admonished Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) and House Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for possibly breaking House rules by offering support for Smith's son in exchange for a vote and threatening retaliation if Smith did not vote for the Medicare bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63387-2004Sep30.html|title=Ethics Panel Rebukes DeLay (washingtonpost.com)|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref>

The report... admonished Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) for making comments about Brad Smith during the Nov 22 roll call that appeared to be "a threat of retaliation" for Nick Smith's vote against the bill.

Representative Miller told the Investigative Subcommittee that the first time she spoke to Representative Smith about his vote on the Medicare legislation was on the House floor while the vote was open, after Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she spoke with him during the first hour of the time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith's no vote on the board and she "didn't like the way that he voted." Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: "Is this how you're going to vote; or, This is how you're going to vote? And he said, Obviously."

Representative Miller recalled that she responded by saying words to the effect of: "Well, I hope your son doesn't come to Congress, or I'm not going to support your son, or something to that effect." Representative Smith then "rose up out of his seat and said, You get out of here." That was the end of the interaction between the two Members. Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote on the Medicare legislation.

Representative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smith's recollection was that Representative Miller "came up and said something like, I haven't been involved in this campaign before, but if you don't change your vote, I'll get involved, and I'll make sure Brad isn't elected."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethics.house.gov/committee-report/investigation-certain-allegations-related-voting-medicare-prescription-drug|title=Investigation of Certain Allegations Related to Voting on the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003 - House Committee on Ethics|publisher=|accessdate=October 24, 2016}}</ref>}}

In her first bid for public office, Miller lost to Democrat [[David E. Bonior]] for [[Michigan's 12th congressional district]].

===1994===
Miller was elected [[Michigan Secretary of State]], unseating 6-term incumbent [[Richard H. Austin]]. She was the first Republican to serve as Secretary of State in Michigan in 40 years since [[Owen Cleary]] left office in 1955.

===1998===
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and the [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Perry Spencer by 1 million votes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/98gen/03000000.html |accessdate=May 9, 2012 |title=Election Results November 03, 1998 Secretary of State 4 Year Term |date=February 9, 1999 |publisher=[[Michigan Secretary of State]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090615115352/http://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/98gen/03000000.html |archivedate=June 15, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> the largest margin of victory for a candidate running statewide in Michigan.

===2002===
After the [[2000 United States Census]], the [[Michigan Legislature]] reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[David Bonior]]. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb]]. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the [[governor of Michigan]] rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a "[[Hubert Humphrey]] Democrat", and Miller called herself a "[[George W. Bush]] Republican." She outraised Marlinga, and secured the [[Teamsters Union]] (but not [[AFL-CIO]]) endorsement.<ref name=Barone_2010>{{cite book

===2006===
Miller faced no opposition in the Republican primary, and was [[Acclamation|acclaimed]] as the Republican candidate on August 8, 2006. In the general election Miller was challenged by Democrat [[Robert Denison]] and three third-party candidates. Miller defeated Denison 178,843 to 84,574 votes.

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]], Miller endorsed Former [[New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, "When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation."

Miller spoke on behalf of Senator [[John McCain]] and was a vocal supporter of Governor [[Sarah Palin]]. She was a member of Gov. Palin's "truth squad" leading up to the 2008 presidential election.
