==Football career==

===Early years===
Runyan was born in [[Flint, Michigan]] where his father was an employee of [[General Motors]].<ref>[http://runyanforcongress.com/about/ Runyan campaign bio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203021310/http://runyanforcongress.com//about/ |date=2010-12-03 }}</ref>

===Professional===

====Houston/Tennessee Oilers/Titans====
Runyan was [[NFL Draft|drafted]] in the fourth round (109th overall) of the [[1996 NFL Draft]] by the Houston Oilers (now the [[Tennessee Titans]]). He played with the Houston Oilers in [[1996 NFL season|1996]] and became a [[Starting lineup|starter]] in only the sixth game of his rookie season. He moved with the team as they became the Tennessee Oilers in [[1997 NFL season|1997]] and [[1998 NFL season|1998]], and finally played one year in the new jerseys as the Tennessee Titans in [[1999 NFL season|1999]] when the team made it to [[Super Bowl XXXIV]].  Runyan was the last active player in the NFL to have played for the Houston Oilers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:HCBF&rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&rft_dat=1203F3E0DBF6EB98&svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&req_dat=0D0CB579A3BDA420|title=And then there was one – After McNair's retirement, Eagles tackle Runyan is last Oiler standing|accessdate=September 30, 2009|date=April 20, 2008|work=[[Houston Chronicle]]|author=McClain, John}}</ref>

====Philadelphia Eagles====
Runyan was signed by the [[Philadelphia Eagles]] to a six-year, $30 million contract on February 14, 2000 as an [[unrestricted free agent]]. The contract made him the highest paid offensive lineman in NFL history at the time.<ref>{{cite news |title=RB Stewart heads to Motor City |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=RN0nAAAAIBAJ&sjid=IOwDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3662,3896861 |date=February 15, 2000 |accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> Runyan was selected to the Pro Bowl in [[2003 Pro Bowl|2002]].

On March 24, 2006, the Eagles announced that Runyan had re-signed with the team with a three-year contract.<ref>{{cite web|author=Pasquarelli, Len|title=Eagles, OT Runyan agree to three-year contract|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2382786 |publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=March 24, 2006|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> He had visited with the [[New York Jets]] on March 21 prior to re-signing with the Eagles.<ref>{{cite web |author=Robinson, Charles |title=Bargain shopping begins|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news?slug=cr-freeagents032106&prov=yhoo&type=lgns|publisher=Yahoo! Sports|date=March 21, 2006|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref>

In a ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' magazine in October 2006, Runyan was ranked second on a list of the Dirtiest Players in the NFL.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pats' Harrison can't wash hands of dirtiest player label|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=2631666|publisher=[[ESPN.com]]|date=October 19, 2006|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref> Bills linebacker [[Shawne Merriman]] stated that Runyan "was one of the dirtiest players I've ever been against in my whole entire life. He was real good at being dirty".<ref name="yahoo1">{{cite web|url=https://sports.yahoo.com/nfl/news;_ylt=AnRkPoOmuMi2Z.bU8g2lhCRDubYF?slug=ap-chargers-runyan&prov=ap&type=lgns |title=Yahoo! Sports – Sports News, Scores, Rumors, Fantasy Games, and more|publisher=Sports.yahoo.com|date=|accessdate=August 22, 2010}}</ref> Runyan did not deny the charges, criticizing the current game instead: "That's the way the game's supposed to be played. I think they’ve tried to change that over the years. It's turned into a basketball game out there."<ref name="yahoo1"/>

In a 2007 game against the [[Dallas Cowboys]], Runyan instructed Eagles running back [[Brian Westbrook]] to take a knee at the one-yard line rather than score a [[touchdown]] with two minutes left in the game so that Dallas would not get the ball back.  Westbrook followed Runyan's direction, the play worked, and Philadelphia won the game.<ref>{{cite web|title=Eagles RB Westbrook credits Runyan for his stop inside 1-yard line|url=http://www.cbssports.com/nfl/story/10534431|publisher=CBSSports.com|date=December 17, 2007|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref>

A 2008 poll revealed that getting blocked by Runyan on a screen pass was one of the scariest things in the NFL.<ref>[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?page=hotread7/seifert ESPN article on 2008 poll re getting blocked by Runyan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081102155414/http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/columns/story?page=hotread7%2Fseifert |date=2008-11-02 }}</ref>

Runyan held the remarkable streak for an [[offensive lineman]] of having started 190 consecutive regular season games. This was the second longest streak among active NFL players in [[2008 NFL season|2008]]. He has also started in all 18 playoff games his teams have appeared in during this streak.

On January 28, 2009, Runyan had microfacture surgery on his right knee.<ref>{{cite news|author=Tucker, Ross|title=Old man and the knee: Runyan eyes return despite injury issues|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/ross_tucker/05/27/runyan/?eref=T1|work=[[Sports Illustrated]]|date=May 27, 2009|accessdate=March 7, 2010|authorlink=Ross Tucker}}</ref> In February 2009, Runyan's contract expired with the team. He worked out for the Eagles on September 10,<ref>[http://www.philadelphiaeagles.com/news/Story.asp?story_id=18686 Eagles Work Out Runyan – Philadelphia Eagles]</ref> but did not sign a contract.  He was signed by the [[San Diego Chargers]], playing in five games before retiring.
