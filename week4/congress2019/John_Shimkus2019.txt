==Early life, education, and career==
Shimkus is a lifelong resident of [[Collinsville, Illinois|Collinsville]], part of the [[Metro East]] portion of the [[St. Louis]] [[Greater St. Louis|metropolitan area]]. He is the son of Kathleen N. (née Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus. His paternal grandfather was of [[Lithuania]]n descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/shimkus.htm |title=shimkus |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref> While in the Army, he earned the [[Expert Infantry Badge]], [[Ranger tab]], and [[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]]. He served overseas with the [[54th Infantry Regiment (United States)|54th Infantry Regiment]] in [[West Germany]].<ref name="AUSA2011">{{cite web|url=http://www.ausa.org/legislation/congressionalinfo/Documents/OAS%20112th%20Congress.pdf |title=Once a Soldier...

He first ran for office in 1989, when he was elected a [[Collinsville Township, Madison County, Illinois|Collinsville Township]] trustee. A year later, he was elected as [[Madison County, Illinois|Madison County]] treasurer—the first Republican elected to a countywide post in 10 years. In 1994, he became the first Republican to be re-elected as county treasurer in 60 years.

==Political positions==

===Domestic issues===

====Climate change====

On March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley]], during a [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]] hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of [[carbon dioxide]] in [[global warming]]:

<blockquote>It's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.<ref name="capping co2">{{cite web |url=http://www.progressillinois.com/2009/3/27/shimkus-carbon-emissions-plant-food|title=Shimkus: Capping C02 Emissions Will "Take Away Plant Food"|accessdate=2009-04-16|date=2009-03-27|publisher=Progress Illinois|author=Doster, Adam}}</ref></blockquote>

Shimkus has quoted the Bible to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44958.html |title=John Shimkus cites Genesis on climate change - Darren Samuelsohn |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref> He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on something that cannot be changed versus the changes that have been occurring forever. Specifically, Shimkus said, "Now, do I believe in climate change? In my trip to Greenland, the answer is yes. The climate is changing. The question is more about the costs and benefits and trying to spend taxpayer dollars on something that you cannot stop versus the changes that have been occurring forever. That's the real debate."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1328366/John-Shimkus-Global-warming-wont-destroy-planet-God-promised-Noah.html | work=Daily Mail | title='The planet won't be destroyed by global warming because God promised Noah,' says politician bidding to chair U.S. energy committee | location=London | date=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

====Food safety====
Shimkus has been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was passed by Congress and signed by the president. Of the bill, he said: "When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority."<ref name="food safety"/>

===Keystone pipeline===
In May 2013, Shimkus stated he would renew his support for the [[Keystone pipeline]]. The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian [[crude oil]] through the Midwest, including Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/05/31/illinois-reps-shimkus-and-davis-renew-push-for-keystone-pipeline/ |title=Illinois Reps. Shimkus and Davis Renew Push For Keystone Pipeline |date=May 31, 2013 |publisher=St. Louis-CBS Local |accessdate=27 July 2013}}</ref>

===National security===
Shimkus spoke positively of President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to temporarily curtail immigration from specified countries until better screening methods are devised. He stated that "This temporary halt will give Congress and the new Administration time to evaluate and improve the vetting process, and in the meantime gives Secretary Kelly authority to grant exceptions to the restrictions as needed. One of those exceptions must be to green card holders, who have already undergone extensive screening."<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref>

===Social issues===

====2006 Mark Foley scandal====

Shimkus said "that in late-2005 he learned—through information passed along by Alexander's office—about an e-mail exchange in which Foley asked about the youngster's well-being after [[Hurricane Katrina]] and requested a photograph."<ref name="pageconcerned">{{cite news | url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/09/sixteenyearold_.html | title=Sixteen-Year-Old Who Worked as Capitol Hill Page Concerned About E-mail Exchange with Congressman | publisher=The Blotter, [[ABC News]] | date=September 28, 2006 | accessdate=2006-10-05 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004124649/http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/09/sixteenyearold_.html | archivedate=October 4, 2006 | df= }}</ref>

====Cannabis====
Shimkus has a "D" rating from [[NORML]] for his voting history regarding [[cannabis]]-related causes. Shimkus opposes veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their [[Veterans Health Administration]] doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.<ref name="NORML">{{cite web|title=Illinois Scorecard|url=http://norml.org/congressional-scorecard/illinois|website=NORML|accessdate=27 December 2017|language=en-us}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 1992, while still serving as Madison County treasurer, he won the Republican nomination to run for the U.S. House seat in what was then the 20th District. He was defeated by 10-year [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Dick Durbin]].

Four years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the [[United States Senate]]. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced [[Illinois House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Jay C. Hoffman]] in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.

He has only faced one credible Democratic opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th District of two-term Democratic representative [[David D. Phelps]]. The new district retained Phelps' district number, but geographically and demographically was much more Shimkus' district, as he retained 60% of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families.<ref name="stay close"/> Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, he was easily reelected.

Shimkus announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge<ref name="pledge">[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/1285.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205206/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/1285.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.

When seeking his 11th term [[United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2016#District 15|in 2016]], Shimkus faced Illinois [[Illinois Senate|State Senator]] [[Kyle McCarter]] in the Republican primary. McCarter ran to the [[Right-wing politics|political right]] of Shimkus<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bnd.com/news/local/article38146497.html|title=McCarter kicks off campaign against Shimkus; declares himself more conservative|work=[[Belleville News-Democrat]]|last=Brueggemann|first=Brian|date=October 7, 2015|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | last1=McDermott | first1=Kevin | title=A Short Run-Down of Illinois' Primary Situation Headed Toward March 15 | url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/kevin-mcdermott/a-short-run-down-of-illinois-primary-situation-headed-toward/article_fa92320a-283d-55ba-8e9e-1e65aba8d860.html | date=February 16, 2016 | publisher=''stltoday.com'' | accessdate=February 19, 2015}}</ref> and criticized his accommodation with the Obama administration as well as national Republican party leadership.<ref>{{cite web|last=Greenfield |first=Jeff |url=http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-score/2016/03/shimkus-among-three-house-incumbent-primaries-to-watch-tuesday-emilys-list-dominating-maryland-senate-race-senate-spending-vote-drama-in-ohio-213186 |title=Shimkus among three House incumbent primaries to watch Tuesday |website=Politico.com |date=2015-12-31 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}</ref> Shimkus won the primary with 60.4% of the vote to McCarter's 39.6%.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elections.il.gov/ElectionResults.aspx?ID=SKR13%2f24Geo%3d |title=Election Results – General Primary – 3/15/2016 |publisher=Illinois State Board of Elections |accessdate=December 12, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Donaldedonald |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.bnd.com/news/politics-government/article66291932.html |title=Shimkus holds off challenge from McCarter; Vandersand concedes to Davis &#124; Belleville News-Democrat |website=Bnd.com |date=2016-03-15 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}</ref>

FEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] in 2005. The fund also made contributions to [[Peter Roskam]], a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to [[David McSweeney (politician)|David McSweeney]], a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 8th district, in 2006.<ref name="query">{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_supopp/C00390831/ |title=Committees and Candidates Supported/Opposed |publisher=Query.nictusa.com |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150505044213/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_supopp/C00390831/ |archivedate=2015-05-05 |df= }}</ref><ref name="query1">{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H6IL06117 |title=Committees Who Gave To This Candidate |publisher=Query.nictusa.com |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019000309/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H6IL06117 |archivedate=2015-10-19 |df= }}</ref><ref name="query2">{{cite web |url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H8IL08044 |title=Committees Who Gave To This Candidate |publisher=Query.nictusa.com |accessdate=2015-03-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504174837/http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H8IL08044 |archivedate=2015-05-04 |df= }}</ref> In 2006, the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned.

==Electoral history==
The {{ushr|Illinois|20|20th district}} was disbanded after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]] due to reapportionment and Illinois' loss of a U.S. House seat, which is why Shimkus faced [[David D. Phelps]], incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district. The district includes much of the southern portion of the state, including a portion of the [[Metro-East]], which is the Illinois side of the [[St. Louis]] area.
