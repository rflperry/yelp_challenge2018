'''Kevin Patrick Brady''' (born April 11, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|TX|8}}, serving since 1997. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district includes a large swath of suburban and rural territory north of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Brady was born in [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], one of five children of William F. and Nancy A. Brady. His father, a lawyer, was killed in 1967 in a courtroom shooting in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] when Brady was 12 years old.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=AP|title=Wild Shooting Spree Caught On Tape|journal=Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date=September 27, 1967|volume=XLII|issue=232|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b24eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mskEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3571%2C5262217|accessdate=December 17, 2015}}</ref> His mother was left to raise five children by herself. While at [[Central High School (Rapid City, South Dakota)|Central High School]], he was student body president and a four-sport athlete. He graduated in 1973. Working his way through college holding a variety of jobs—construction worker, meat packer, manufacturing worker, waiter, and bartender, Brady earned a degree in mass communications from the [[University of South Dakota]] in Vermillion,<ref>https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/22038/</ref> where he played varsity baseball, served in the student government association and became a member of the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. In 2005, he was named a distinguished alumnus of the university, and in 2001, was a recipient of the order of achievement by the national Lambda Chi Alpha organization.

A chamber of commerce executive at the Rapid City area chamber of commerce, Brady was elected to the Rapid City common council, at age 26. In 1982, he moved to Texas to work for the Beaumont chamber of commerce and later the south Montgomery county, The Woodlands chamber of commerce.

==Texas House of Representatives==
Brady began his Texas political career in 1990 when he was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]], representing The Woodlands, parts of Montgomery County, and five other counties west and north of Houston.<ref>[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=b000755 Brady, Kevin Patrick.] Biographical Directory of the United States Congress: 1774–present.

In 2002, Brady voted in favor of the [[Authorization for the Use of Military Force Against Iraq]], authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|U.S. invasion of Iraq]] the following year.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll455.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 455], On Passage, H.J.Res. 114 (107th): Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002], Office of the Clerk of the House of Representatives.</ref>

In 2005, Brady was a chief supporter of the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (DR-CAFTA), working with the [[George W. Bush administration]] to secure passage of that [[free-trade agreement]].<ref>Peter Baker, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/05/12/AR2005051201809.html Bush Brings In Backup to Help Sell CAFTA], ''Washington Post'' (May 13, 2005).</ref><ref>Howard Roden, [http://www.chron.com/neighborhood/article/Brady-to-spearhead-U-S-campaign-for-CAFTA-9789727.php Brady to spearhead U.S. campaign for CAFTA], ''Houston Chronicle'' (January 12, 2005).</ref><ref>[http://www.ncbfaa.org/Scripts/4Disapi.dll/4DCGI/cms/review.html?Action=CMS_Document&DocID=8993&MenuKey=news NCBFAA Honoring Rep.

Brady is known as the author of a federal "[[sunset clause|sunset law]]" that would require every federal program not specifically written into the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/directory/kevin-brady/ |title=U.S. Rep.

Brady is the chairman of the U.S. House–Senate joint economic committee, the third Texan to lead the committee, after Sen. [[Lloyd Bentsen]] and Rep. [[Wright Patman]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In March 2012, he proposed the Sound Dollar Act, legislation to require the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to [[Gold standard|monitor gold]] and the [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange value]] of the U.S. dollar. The bill would also repeal the Federal Reserve's dual mandate (controlling unemployment and inflation) and replace it with a single mandate for U.S. dollar [[price stability]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812060553/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow|title=King Dollar Will Cut Oil Prices|author=Larry Kudlow|archivedate=August 12, 2014|work=National Review Online}}</ref>

In March 2017, Brady introduced an amendment to the [[American Health Care Act]] (the House Republican proposal to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]]) that would allow health insurance providers to fully deduct all forms of compensation to their most highly compensated executives without limit, repealing the current law, which capped the deduction at $500,000 per executive. ''Los Angeles Times'' columnist [[Michael Hiltzik]] criticized Brady's amendment as a "secret payoff" to the health insurance industry because of the cryptic language of Brady's amendment.<ref>[https://waysandmeans.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/20170308-Amendment-in-the-Nature-of-a-Substitute-to-Subtitle-__-Budget-Reconciliation-Legislative-Recommendations-Relating-to-Remuneration-from-Certain-Insurers.pdf Amendment in the Nature of a Substitute to the Committee Print Relating to Remuneration from Certain Insurers Offered by Mr. Brady of Texas]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-obamacare-ceos-20170307-story.html |title=Here's the secret payoff to health insurance CEOs buried in the GOP Obamacare repeal bill |publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=March 6, 2017 |accessdate=June 22, 2017}}</ref>

In November 2017, Brady said that the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]] would provide "tax relief at every level"; in fact, 7 percent of households in 2018 would pay ''more'' in taxes and by 2022, one quarter of households would pay ''more''.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=http://www.factcheck.org/2017/11/cherry-picking-tax-cut-estimates/|title=Cherry-Picking Tax Cut Estimates - FactCheck.org|date=2017-11-29|work=FactCheck.org|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en-US}}</ref> Brady's claim that 70% of the tax cuts in the bill would go to households making below $200,000 was found to be "misleading" by [[FactCheck.org|FactCheck.Org]] and "cherry-picked" by [[PolitiFact]].<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/nov/30/kevin-brady/does-70-percent-tax-bills-relief-go-those-making-u/|title=Does 70% of tax bill benefits go to families under $200,000?|work=@politifact|access-date=2017-12-02|language=en}}</ref> FactCheck.org noted that "57.7 percent of the tax relief goes to those families making less than $200,000 in 2019 — not the 70 percent that Brady cited for 2019.

Incumbent Republican congressman [[Jack Fields]] of [[Texas' 8th congressional district]] decided to retire. Brady decided to run and ranked second in the Republican primary with 22% of the vote in a six candidate field. But the candidate who ranked first, Dr. Gene Fontenot, received just 36% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222672|title=Our Campaigns – TX District 8 – R Primary Race – Mar 12, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In the run-off election, Brady defeated him 53%–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222682|title=Our Campaigns – TX District 8 – R Runoff Race – Apr 09, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Bush v.
