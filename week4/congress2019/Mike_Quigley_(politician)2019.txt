'''Michael Bruce Quigley''' (born October 17, 1958) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Illinois|5|}}, serving since the [[Illinois's 5th congressional district special election, 2009|April 7, 2009 special election]]. The district includes most of [[Chicago]]'s North Side, as well as several of the city's western suburbs. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. Quigley is a former member of the [[Cook County Board of Commissioners]], where he represented Chicago's northside neighborhoods of [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]], [[Uptown, Chicago|Uptown]], and [[Rogers Park, Chicago|Rogers Park]]. He also teaches environmental policy and Chicago politics at [[Loyola University Chicago]].

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Quigley was raised in [[Carol Stream, Illinois]], where he graduated from [[Glenbard North High School]] in 1977. He then attended [[Roosevelt University]], where he earned his bachelor's degree. Quigley moved into the [[Lakeview, Chicago|Lakeview]] area of Chicago in 1982, and became involved in community activities. He attended the [[Loyola University Chicago School of Law]], where he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree, and the [[University of Chicago]], where he earned a master's degree in public policy.

Quigley was first elected to the [[Cook County Board of Commissioners]] in 1998, succeeding [[Maria Pappas]] who was elected Cook County Treasurer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-01-08/news/9801080080_1_amarillo-gag-order-endorsed|title=For Elvis' Fans, It Will Be A Jelly Doughnut Kind Of Day|date=January 8, 1998|first1=Judy|last1=Hevrdejs|first2=Mike|last2=Conklin|accessdate=August 3, 2017|newspaper=[[Chicago Tribune]]|location=[[Chicago, Illinois]]}}</ref> During his tenure, he has gained a reputation as a reformer, as he opposed tax hikes supported by Cook County Board President [[John Stroger]], and later his son and successor [[Todd Stroger]]. He contended the county could operate more efficiently, and he presented reports to support the position. Quigley also challenged the practice of finding jobs for Democratic officials with the Cook County Forest Preserve District.<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/chicago/chi-emanuel-seat-bios-quigley-cifeb19,0,2420537.story "Cook Co.

===Elections===
;2009
{{Main|Illinois's 5th congressional district special election, 2009}}
In early 2009, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman [[Rahm Emanuel]] of {{ushr|Illinois|5}} resigned to become [[White House Chief of Staff]] to newly elected President [[Barack Obama]]. The congressional vacancy was filled via [[Illinois's 5th congressional district special election, 2009|the special election]]. Quigley was one of twelve candidates to file for the special Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district. He was endorsed by the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'', which called him "a constant advocate for fiscal responsibility and a watchdog against waste and corruption".<ref>[http://www.suntimes.com/news/elections/endorsements/1431229,CST-EDT-edit15.article "Quigley right choice for 5th District seat"] ''Chicago Sun-Times'', February 14, 2009</ref> He was also endorsed by the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', which cited Quigley's efforts to improve county government, noting, "If Quigley's ideas had all been put in place, the county would not be crying now for more money".<ref>[http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/opinion/chi-0218edit2feb18,0,7339979.story "Democrats Best: Quigley"] ''Chicago Tribune'', February 18, 2009</ref> He won the March special primary with 22% of the vote. The second-ranked candidate, State Representative [[John A. Fritchey|John Fritchey]] received 18% of the vote, four points short.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487231 |title=IL - District 05 - Special Election - D Primary Race - Mar 03, 2009 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> Following the primary, Quigley won the April special election with 69% of the vote over Republican challenger and militia leader Rosana Pulido.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=489029 |title=IL - District 05 - Special Election Race - Apr 07, 2009 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref>

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2010#District 5}}
Quigley won re-election to his first full term in 2010 with 71% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=489028 |title=IL - District 05 Race - Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref>

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2012#District 5}}
After redistricting, Quigley's district was pushed into [[DuPage County]]. The new district absorbed the home of 13th District Republican Congresswoman [[Judy Biggert]]. However, Biggert opted to run for re-election in the 11th District, the successor to the old 13th. The old 5th is only slightly less Democratic than its predecessor; Obama won the district in 2008 with 70% (down three points from the old 5th), and 2010 Democratic U.S. Senate nominee [[Alexi Giannoulias]] carried it with 55% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fieldman |first=Chuck |url=http://westernsprings.suntimes.com/5624580-417/congressional-remap-pushes-democratic-chicago-districts-to-hinsdale-oak-brook.html |title=Congressional remap pushes Chicago Democratic districts to Hinsdale, Oak Brook |work=The Doings Western Springs |date=July 7, 2011 |accessdate=March 27, 2012}}</ref> No Democrat has filed to run against him.

;Gun control
In May 2011, Quigley sponsored an amendment to the [[Patriot Act]] prohibiting the sale of weapons to those on the FBI's Terrorist Watch List.<ref name="Hill">{{cite news|last=Lillis|first=Mike|title=Judiciary Republicans kill bill blocking gun sales to suspected terrorists|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/161037-judiciary-republicans-kill-bill-blocking-gun-sales-to-suspected-terrorists?page=2#comments|newspaper=The Hill|date=May 13, 2011}}</ref> Quigley believed that the Republican limitation of civil liberties under the [[Patriot Act]] contradicted their unwillingness to limit [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights. This bill, proposed as an amendment to the [[Patriot Act]], came under fire from House Republicans Reps. [[James Sensenbrenner Jr.]] of Wisconsin and [[Louie Gohmert]] of Texas, who argued that this would infringe on the Second Amendment rights of those mistakenly placed on the Terrorist Watch List. However, in a vote dictated by political party, the bill lost 21–11 with the House Judiciary panel.<ref name="Hill"/>

;Public health
Quigley has received a rating of 100 (on a scale of 1 to 100) from the [[American Public Health Association]], indicating his strong support of healthcare legislation. In April 2011, Quigley voted against [[Paul Ryan]]'s budget plan (which involved budget cuts to Medicare, as well as decreased government funding to help citizens procure health insurance). Also in April 2011, Quigley voted against repealing the "Prevention and Public Health" fund, a fund focused on Community and Clinical Prevention of chronic diseases, as well as allotting money towards health-care infrastructure and research. Quigley also voted for increases in government spending on physical and occupational therapy.

;Environment
A [[Sierra Club]] member since high school, Quigley initially joined politics because of his desire to help the environment through legislation. Quigley has enacted this desire through supporting the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], a 2009 bill to create an emissions trading plan which passed in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], but was defeated in the Senate. Quigley also introduced the Federal Birdsafe Buildings Bill, a 2011 initiative to make all buildings built by the General Services Administration built with the maximum amount of bird-safe materials and features. In April 2011, Quigley voted to prohibit invasive research on great apes.
