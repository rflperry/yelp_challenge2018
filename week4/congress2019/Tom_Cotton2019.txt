While in high school, Cotton developed an intense desire to attend [[Harvard University]], and worked intently on his studies toward that goal.<ref name="superstar" /> He was accepted to Harvard after graduating from high school in 1995, and majored in government. At Harvard, Cotton was a member of the editorial board of ''[[The Harvard Crimson]]'', often dissenting from the liberal majority.<ref name=gitom/> In articles, Cotton addressed what he saw as "[[Sacred cow (idiom)|sacred cows]]" such as [[affirmative action]].<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/04/16/tom-cotton-takes-on-the-world|title=Tom Cotton Takes On the World|first=Gabrielle|last=Levy|work=[[U.S. News & World Report]]|date=April 16, 2015}}</ref> He graduated with an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] ''[[Latin honors#types|magna cum laude]]'' in 1998 after only three years of study, having written his senior thesis on ''[[The Federalist Papers]]''.<ref name="superstar" />

====Accusations of ''New York Times'' journalists====
In June 2006, while stationed in Iraq, Cotton gained international public attention after he wrote an open letter to the editor of ''[[The New York Times]]'', accusing three journalists of violating "espionage laws" by publishing an article detailing a Bush administration secret program monitoring terrorists' finances. The ''New York Times'' did not publish the letter, but it was published on ''[[Power Line]]'', a conservative blog that had been copied on the email.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2012/10/a-fateful-letter-to-the-editor-of-the-times.php|last=Johnson|first=Scott|title=A FATEFUL LETTER TO THE EDITOR OF THE TIMES|publisher=[[Power Line]]|date=October 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Leibovich|first=Mark|title=Tom Cotton Is Not Mailing It In|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/magazine/tom-cotton-is-not-mailing-it-in.html|website=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 5, 2015}}</ref> In the letter, Cotton called for the journalists responsible for the newspaper article to be imprisoned for [[espionage]]. He asserted that the newspaper had "gravely endangered the lives of my soldiers and all other soldiers and innocent Iraqis here." The article was widely circulated online and reprinted in full in several newspapers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Baumann|first=Nick|title=The GOP Candidate Who Wants Journos Jailed|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2011/11/tom-cotton-arkansas-new-york-times|website=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]|date=November 10, 2011}}</ref>

The letter reached General [[Peter Schoomaker]], [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], who forwarded it via e-mail to all his generals, stating: "Attached for your information are words of wisdom from one of our great lieutenants in Iraq ..."<ref name=nordlinger/> Cotton said in an interview that after meeting with his immediate commander, he was "nervous and worried all night long" about losing his position and even worse, possibly being court-martialed. When he finally met the battalion commander, he was simply told "Well, here's a piece of advice: You're new here. No one's trying to infringe on your right to send a letter or whatnot. But next time, give your chain of command a heads-up."<ref name=nordlinger/>

==House and Senate elections and career, 2013–Present==
Shortly after Cotton's Afghanistan deployment ended, his former boss at the Claremont Institute introduced Cotton to [[Chris Chocola]], a former Congressman and the president of [[Club for Growth]], an influential Republican [[political action committee]].<ref name=superstar/> An attempt was made to draft Cotton for the [[United States Senate election in Arkansas, 2010]] to run against incumbent Democratic U.S. Senator [[Blanche Lincoln]]. Cotton declined, believing he would be rushing a political candidacy.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/tom-cotton-mark-pryor-senate-2014-challenger-biography-2013-8|title=10 Things Everyone Should Know About Tom Cotton, The Arkansas Politician Who Should Scare The Hell Out Of Democrats|first=Brett|last=LoGiurato|publisher=[[Business Insider]]|date=August 12, 2013}}</ref> Following his active duty service, Cotton served in the Army Reserve and did sporadic consulting work for [[McKinsey & Company]],<ref name=superstar/><ref name=nordlinger>{{cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/331200/tom-cotton-arkansas-part-ii-jay-nordlinger|title=Tom Cotton of Arkansas, Part II|first=Jay|last=Nordlinger|work=[[National Review]]|date=October 23, 2012}}</ref> before deciding to run for the [[Arkansas' 4th congressional district|Arkansas 4th]] following retirement of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Mike Ross (politician)|Mike Ross]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/173233-rep-mike-ross-to-announce-political-future|title=Rep.

In September 2011, Cotton faced criticism for an article that he wrote in ''The Harvard Crimson'' in 1998, in which he questioned the value of the Internet as a teaching tool in the classroom, referring to the internet as having "too many temptations" to be useful in schools and libraries. Cotton later stated that the internet had matured since he wrote the article in 1998.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2011/09/01/tom-cotton-learns-value-of-internet|title=Tom Cotton learns value of Internet|first=Max|last=Brantley|work=[[Arkansas Times]]| date=September 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://cei.org/blog/tom-cottons-last-minute-anti-gambling-bill|title=Tom Cotton's Last Minute Anti-Gambling Bill|first=Michelle|last=Minton|work=[[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]| date=September 26, 2016}}</ref>

Cotton accused Obama of holding up a "false choice" between his framework deal on Iran's nuclear program and war.

====Cassandra Butts nomination====
[[File:Senator of Arkansas Tom Cotton at NH FITN 2016 by Michael Vadon 08.jpg|thumb|Senator Cotton at First In The Nation Townhall, [[New Hampshire]]]]
In February 2015, Obama renominated [[Cassandra Butts]], a former White House lawyer, to be the [[United States Ambassador to the Bahamas]]. However, Butts's nomination was blocked by several Republican senators. First, Senator [[Ted Cruz]] placed a blanket hold on all U.S. State Department nominees.<ref name=Butts>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/opinion/an-obama-nominees-crushed-hopes.html|title=An Obama Nominee's Crushed Hopes|first=Frank|last=Bruni|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 7, 2016}}</ref> Cotton specifically blocked the nominations of Butts and ambassador nominees to Sweden and Norway after the Secret Service had leaked private information about a fellow member of Congress, although that issue was unrelated to those nominees. Cotton eventually released his holds on the nominees to Sweden and Norway, but kept his hold on Butts' nomination.<ref name=Butts/>

Butts told ''New York Times'' columnist [[Frank Bruni]] that she had gone to see Cotton about his objections to her nomination, and claimed Cotton had told her that because he knew that the president and Butts were friends, it was a way to "inflict special pain on the president", Bruni claimed. Cotton's spokeswoman did not dispute Butts' characterization. Butts died on May 26, 2016, still awaiting a Senate vote.<ref name=Butts/>

====Letter to Iran's leaders====
On or about March 9, 2015, Cotton wrote and sent [[s:An Open Letter to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran|a letter to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], signed by 47 of the Senate's 54 Republicans, attempting to cast doubt on the Obama administration's authority to engage in [[Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program|nuclear-proliferation negotiations with Iran]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|title=Angry White House and G.O.P.

President [[Barack Obama]] mocked the letter, referring to it as an "unusual coalition" with the [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps]] as well as an interference with the then-ongoing negotiations of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31796235|title=Obama mocks Republican letter to Iran over nuclear talks|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=March 9, 2015}}</ref> In addition, during a [[Vice News]] interview, Obama said, "I'm embarrassed for them. For them to address a letter to the Ayatollah – the Supreme Leader of Iran, who they claim is our mortal enemy – and their basic argument to them is: don't deal with our President, 'cause you can't trust him to follow through on an agreement ... That's close to unprecedented."<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/13/obama-iran-letter_n_6864134.html|title=Obama: 'I'm Embarrassed' For Republicans Who Sent Letter To Iran|first=Paige|last=Lavender|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=March 13, 2015}}</ref>

Iran's Foreign Minister, [[Javad Zarif]], responded to the letter by saying "[the Senators'] letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such mere executive agreements that have been or will be entered into by the US with various other governments". Zarif pointed out that the nuclear deal is not supposed to be an Iran–US deal, but an international one, saying that "change of administration does not in any way relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible agreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program." He continued, "I wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://en.mfa.ir/index.aspx?siteid=3&fkeyid=&siteid=3&fkeyid=&siteid=3&pageid=1997&newsview=330948|title=Dr. Zarif`s Response to the Letter of US Senators|first=Javad|last=Zarif|publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)]]|date=March 9, 2015}}</ref>

On March 15, 2015, Cotton defended the letter amid criticism that it undermined the president's efforts. "It's so important we communicated this message straight to Iran," he told CBS News' ''[[Face the Nation]]'' "No regrets at all," and "they already control Tehran, increasingly they control Damascus and Beirut and Baghdad and now Sana'a as well."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/15/freshmen-gop-sen-cotton-says-no-regrets-about-letter-warning-iran-about-nuclear.html |title=Freshman GOP Senator Cotton says no regrets about letter warning Iran about Nuclear Deterrent |publisher=[[Fox News]] |date=March 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/videos/march-15-kerry-cotton-manchin/ |title=Face the Nation: March 15 Kerry, Cotton, Manchin |publisher=[[CBS News]] |date=March 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tom-cotton-us-senator-apparently-does-not-know-the-capital-of-iran-10111640.html |title=Tom Cotton, US Senator, apparently does not know the capital of Iran |first=Payton |last=Guion |work=[[The Independent]] |date=March 16, 2015}}</ref> He continued to defend his action in an interview with [[MSNBC]] by saying, "There are nothing but hardliners in Iran.

====Support from pro-Israel groups====
Cotton has received heavy support from pro-Israel groups due to his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and for his hawkish stance toward Iran. Several pro-Israel Republican billionaires who contributed millions of dollars to [[William Kristol]]'s [[Emergency Committee for Israel]] spent $960,000 to support Cotton.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/us/politics/gops-israel-support-deepens-as-political-contributions-shift.html|title=GOP's Israel support deepens as political contributions shift|first=Eric|last=Lipton|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=April 4, 2015}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

==Political positions==
===Domestic policy===
====Gun laws====
Cotton has an A rating from the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA), which endorsed him during the 2014 election. The NRA's Chris W. Cox stated that "Tom Cotton will always stand up for the values and freedoms of Arkansas gun owners and sportsmen."<ref>{{cite press release|title=NRA Endorses Tom Cotton for U.S. Senate in Arkansas|url=https://www.nrapvf.org/articles/20140909/nra-endorses-tom-cotton-for-us-senate-in-arkansas|publisher=[[National Rifle Association]]|date=September 9, 2014}}</ref> In response to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], Cotton stated that he did not believe any new gun control legislation would have prevented the mass shooting from taking place.<ref>{{cite news|last=Shelbourne|first=Mallory|title=Cotton: Las Vegas shooter's weapon sounded like 'belt-fed machine gun'|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/353589-cotton-las-vegas-shooters-weapon-sounded-like-belt-fed-machine-gun|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=October 3, 2017}}</ref>

====Healthcare====
In September 2012, Cotton said regarding the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (ACA) that "the first step is to repeal that law, which is offensive to a free society and a free people".<ref>{{cite news|title=4th District hopefuls split on health care law|url=http://www.couriernews.com/view/full_story/20271348/article-4th-District-hopefuls-split-on-health-care-law|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=September 26, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Ramsey|first=David|title=How Tom Cotton talks when he talks about Obamacare|url=http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/04/18/how-tom-cotton-talks-when-he-talks-about-obamacare|work=[[Arkansas Times]]|date=April 14, 2014}}</ref> In April 2014, Cotton was one of 38 Republican lawmakers that signed an ''[[amicus curiae]]'' in support of Senator [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]]'s legal challenge against the [[United States Office of Personnel Management]]'s ACA ruling.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/04/22/38-gop-lawmakers-join-ron-johnsons-obamacare-lawsuit|title=38 GOP lawmakers join Ron Johnson's Obamacare lawsuit|first=Ed|last=O'Keefe|website=[[The Washington Post]]|date=April 24, 2014}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

====Immigration====
Cotton has stated "We cannot afford to grant illegal aliens amnesty or a so-called earned path to citizenship. Amnesty would cost billions of dollars that our government cannot afford. Also, amnesty would attract millions of new illegal aliens, just as the 1986 amnesty did, by advertising to the world that America lacks the political will to enforce its borders. Finally, amnesty is unjust and immoral because it favors those who broke our laws over those standing in line at embassies hoping to immigrate legally."<ref>{{cite web|title=Tom Cotton on Immigration|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Tom_Cotton_Immigration.htm|website=[[On the Issues]]}}</ref>

In July 2013, after the Senate's bi-partisan [[Gang of Eight (immigration)|Gang of Eight]] passed the [[Border Security, Economic Opportunity, and Immigration Modernization Act of 2013]], an immigration reform proposal, House Republicans held a closed door meeting to decide whether to bring the bill to a vote.<ref name=flank>{{cite news|last=Costa|first=Robert|title=Picking Tom Cotton: On immigration, a freshman speaks for the right flank of the House GOP|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/353386/picking-tom-cotton-robert-costa|work=[[The National Review]]|date=July 15, 2013}}</ref> Budget Committee Chairman [[Paul Ryan]] spoke at one podium arguing for the bill's passage.<ref name=newyorker16>{{cite news|last=Lizza|first=Ryan|title=Occupied Territory: The Republican élite struggles over whether to resist Trump or capitulate|url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/06/20/inside-the-gop-trump-dilemma|work=[[The New Yorker]]|date=July 20, 2016}}</ref> Cotton spoke at another podium arguing against the bill, even exchanging terse comments with Speaker Boehner.<ref name=flank/> Cotton noted that a tougher stance on immigration had done little to diminish [[Mitt Romney]]'s electoral support among Hispanics in 2012 compared to [[John McCain]]'s in 2008.

In an opinion piece published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' in September 2016, Cotton and [[Mike Pompeo]] compared the policy of [[Immigration to Norway]] favorably to the policy of [[Immigration to Sweden]]. He maintained that the Norwegian government had to a greater extent than that of Sweden listened to the concerns of its citizens in contrast to the dominant Swedish major parties which did not listen to its constituents. He proceeded to compare the differing results in Scandinavia to that of the United States, where immigration-friendly elites have been held in check by immigration-sceptical constituents.<ref>{{cite news | last1=Cotton | first1=Tom | last2=Pompeo | first2=Mike | title=What We Learned in Scandinavia About Migrants | url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-learned-in-scandinavia-about-migrants-1474932369 | publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] | date= September 26, 2016}}{{subscription required}}</ref>

Cotton supported President Trump's 2017 [[Executive Order 13769]] that temporarily curtailed immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries. He stated that "It's simply wrong to call the president's executive order concerning immigration and refugees 'a religious test' of any kind. I doubt many Arkansans or Americans more broadly object to taking a harder look at foreigners coming into our country from war-torn nations with known terror networks; I think they're wondering why we don't do that already."<ref>{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban|work=[[The Denver Post]]|date=January 29, 2017}}</ref>

On February 7, 2017, in the presence of President Trump, Cotton and Senator [[David Perdue]] (R-[[Georgia (U.S. state)|GA]]), jointly proposed a new immigration bill called the [[RAISE Act]] which would  limit the family route or [[chain migration]]. The bill would set a limit on the number of refugees offered residency at 50,000 a year and would remove the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]]. Senators [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-SC) and [[John McCain]] (R-AZ) both expressed opposition to the bill.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/united-states/21717106-reforming-legal-immigration-new-effort-narrow-route-permanent-residency|title=A new effort to narrow the route to permanent residency in America|work=[[The Economist]]|date=February 16, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/08/can-a-decades-old-immigration-proposal-pass-under-trump/537138|title=Can a Decades-Old Immigration Proposal Pass Under Trump?|first=Priscilla|last=Alvarez|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=August 21, 2017}}</ref>

After the violent incidents surrounding the [[2017 Unite the Right rally]], Cotton issued a statement condemning white [[supremacism]]. Cotton stated that "White supremacists who claim to 'take America back' only betray their own ignorance of what makes America so special: our country's founding recognition of the natural rights of all mankind and commitment to the defense of the rights of all Americans. These contemptible little men do not speak for what is just, noble, and best about America".<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=769|title=Cotton Statement on the Violence in Charlottesville|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|date=August 13, 2017}}</ref>

In response to the [[2017 New York City truck attack]], Cotton slammed the [[Diversity Immigrant Visa]] program as a threat to national security following reports the attack's perpetrator was a recipient of the program. Cotton stated that "Yesterday's attack was an outrage, especially because it was entirely preventable. The diversity visa lottery program has long been deeply flawed, but now we see very clearly how it's a threat to our national security."<ref>{{cite press release|url=https://www.cotton.senate.gov/?p=press_release&id=817|title=Cotton: Diversity Lottery Is a Threat to Our National Security|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|date=November 1, 2017}}</ref>

In September 2017, Cotton stated that he would support legalization of existing recipients of [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] by giving them [[Permanent residence (United States)|green cards]] if Congress passed legislation that would protect American workers from the effects of that legalization, including requiring [[E-Verify]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/byron-york-tom-cotton-top-senate-immigration-hawk-supports-legalization-in-daca-deal/article/2633325|title=Byron York: Tom Cotton, top Senate immigration hawk, supports legalization in DACA deal|first=Byron|last=York|work=[[The Washington Examiner]]|date=September 4, 2017}}</ref>

On January 14th, 2018, on ABC's Face the Nation, Cotton stated that President Trump had not disparaged Haiti, Haitians, Africa, Africans, and Salvadorans in a meeting in the Oval Office regarding immigration policy and the status of those falling under the Obama Administration's DACA protections (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals). Speaking to media again on January 16th, 2018, Cotton repeated this assertion. In both instances, his statements were predicated on his assertion that his colleagues, Sen. [[Dick Durbin]] (D-IL) and Sen. [[Lindsey Graham]] (R-SC), lied in their statements that the President had in fact disparaged those nations and peoples in the January 11 meeting, and that the President's language had been salacious, including derogatory curse words that persons on all sides of the incident had described as "vulgar".<ref>https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sen-cotton-says-trumps-words-sentiments-on-immigration-were-misrepresented/</ref>

====Minimum wage====
After not taking a position on minimum wage during his campaign, in September 2014, Cotton said he would vote, as a citizen, in favor of the Arkansas Minimum Wage Initiative, a November 2014 referendum to raise Arkansas's minimum wage from $6.25 an hour to $8.50 an hour by 2017. Cotton was criticized for failing to take a public position on the issue until public opinion was overwhelmingly in favor.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/05/tom-cotton-minimum-wage_n_5772246.html|title=Tom Cotton Says He Will Vote For Minimum Wage Hike 'As A Citizen'|first=Igor|last=Bobic|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=September 5, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2014/09/28/the-not-so-principled-stand-of-tom-cotton-on-the-minimum-wage|title=The not-so-principled stand of Tom Cotton on the minimum wage|first=David|last=Ramsey|work=[[Arkansas Times]]|date=September 28, 2014}}</ref>

====Student loans====
In August 2013, Cotton voted against the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act of 2013, which lowered interest rates on [[student loan]]s. Cotton had received federally-subsidized student loans when he was a student but said he didn't want the government in the student loan business, noting that he and his family worked for years to afford his college education.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/tom-cotton-student-loans_n_3692026.html|title=Tom Cotton, Arkansas Rep., Took Student Loans, Voted Against Them|first=Michael|last=McAuliff|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Cotton has criticized the foreign policies described as the [[Clinton Doctrine]], [[Bush Doctrine]], [[Obama Doctrine]] for failing to earn widespread public support of the [[Commoner|common American]], described by Cotton as "[[Jacksonian democracy|Jacksonian]] America". Cotton's own foreign policy ideas were described by ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' as "[[hawkish]] and realistic, though tinged with idealism", and similar to the [[Roosevelt Corollary]] to the [[Monroe doctrine]], claiming to seek to avoid intervention while steadfastly committing, "There is always a military option. That is the case everywhere in the world". Generally, Cotton believes in [[peace through strength]] by forming alliances with [[Old World]] countries (in the Middle East, Asia, and Europe), partially as defense and partially to fulfill "moral aspirations for America's role in the world".

Cotton is decidedly hawkish toward every country among America's primary "headline" relations: China, Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Cotton is perhaps most hawkish on [[Iran–United States relations]], describing Iran as a greater long-term challenge than [[North Korea]]. Cotton insists [[China]] is "a rival in every regard … not a partner", and believes the superpower rivalry between the United States and Russia is inherent given the conflicting forms of government and relative power. He has shown less concern with the [[Nationalism#21st century|rightward shift of Central and Eastern European countries]] such as [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], and [[Turkey]]. Cotton's approach almost exclusively relies on bilateral relations over multilateralism, and focuses more on security than idealism or values.<ref>{{ cite journal |title= A Foreign Policy for 'Jacksonian America' |journal= [[The Wall Street Journal]] |url= https://www.wsj.com/articles/a-foreign-policy-for-jacksonian-america-1512774761 |date= December 9–10, 2017 |last= Willick |first= Jason  |accessdate= August 5, 2018 }} {{subscription required}}</ref>

====Sanctions on Iran====
In 2013, Cotton introduced legislative language to prohibit trade with relatives of individuals subject to [[U.S. sanctions against Iran]]. According to Cotton, this would include "a spouse and any relative to the third degree," such as, "parents, children, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, grandparents, great grandparents, grandkids, great grandkids." After Cotton's amendment came under harsh criticism regarding its constitutionality, he withdrew it.<ref>{{cite news|last=Waldman| first=Paul|title=For Tom Cotton, letter to Iran is anything but a 'fiasco'|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/11/for-tom-cotton-letter-to-iran-is-anything-but-a-fiasco|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Carter|first=Zach|title=Here's Why Republicans Love Tom Cotton's Letter To Iran|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/17/americans-dont-like-tom-c_n_6887896.html|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=March 17, 2015}}</ref>
