==Controversies==
On February 11, 2017, Biliarkis hosted a townhall in Pasco County, Florida where he was faced with several protesters angry over the potential repeal of the Affordable Healthcare Act, when the chairman of the GOP in the county, Bill Akins repeated the now debunked claim that the ACA contains "what is effectively known as death panels." Biliarkis nodded in agreement and later told CNN that "The board exists, OK? And I've voted to repeal the board." Congressman Biliarkis seemed to equate the death panel with  the Independent Advisory Board, a 15-member committee that issues recommendations for reducing healthcare costs, subject to congressional oversight and approval.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/02/11/politics/death-panel-florida-gop-congressman/index.html|title='Death panel' disputes erupt at Florida GOP congressman's town hall|last=CNN|first=Eric Bradner,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-05-25}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2009/aug/10/sarah-palin/sarah-palin-barack-obama-death-panel|title=Sarah Palin falsely claims Barack Obama runs a 'death panel'|work=@politifact|access-date=2018-05-25|language=en}}</ref>
