Blumenauer was born in Portland on August 16, 1948. In 1966, he graduated from [[Centennial High School (Gresham, Oregon)|Centennial High School]] on the eastside of Portland and then enrolled at [[Lewis & Clark College]] in the southwest part of the city.<ref name=congbio>{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=b000574 | title=Earl Blumenauer | work=Biographical Directory of the United States Congress | accessdate=November 19, 2008}}</ref> He majored in political science and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from Lewis & Clark in 1970.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.bipac.net/php.asp?g=NFIB&page=Candidate_Guide&legdistrictid=5230 | title=Voter Guide for Oregon District 3 | publisher=[[National Federation of Independent Business]] | accessdate=December 30, 2006}}</ref> Blumenauer completed his education in 1976 when he earned a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the school's Northwestern School of Law (now [[Lewis & Clark Law School]]).<ref>{{cite news | title=Blumenauer speaks at law commencement | url=http://www.lclark.edu/dept/public/blumenauer.html | work=Lewis &amp; Clark Chronicle | publisher=Lewis &amp; Clark College | date=Summer 2002 | accessdate=December 30, 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108134859/http://www.lclark.edu/dept/public/blumenauer.html | archivedate=November 8, 2006 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> Starting before law school in 1970 and continuing until 1977, he worked as an assistant to the president of [[Portland State University]].<ref name=congbio/><ref name="abouteb">{{cite web|url=http://www.earlblumenauer.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?page=about |title=About Earl Blumenauer |publisher=Blumenauer for Congress |accessdate=December 30, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061213193856/http://www.earlblumenauer.com/cgi-bin/display.cgi?page=about |archivedate=December 13, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}</ref>

==Early political career==
In 1969–70, Blumenauer organized and led Oregon's "Go 19" campaign, an effort to lower the state voting age (while then unsuccessful, it supported the national trend which soon resulted in the [[Twenty-sixth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which lowered the voting age to 18). In 1972, he was elected to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] as a Democrat representing District 11 in [[Multnomah County, Oregon|Multnomah County]].<ref>[http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1973reg.html 1973 Regular Session (57th).] Oregon State Archives.

In the [[Political effects of Hurricane Katrina|political aftermath of Hurricane Katrina]] Blumenauer noted that he was among those who had pointed out the vulnerability of New Orleans and encouraged Congress to help that city and the gulf coast get better prepared:
* September 15, 2004: [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Mr. Speaker]], barely have we recovered from [[Hurricane Hugo]] and we are seeing [[Hurricane Ivan]] pose the threat that has long been feared by those in Louisiana, that this actually might represent the loss of the City of New Orleans. Located 15 feet below sea level, there is the potential of a 30-foot wall of water putting at risk $100 billion of infrastructure and industry and countless lives.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://blumenauer.house.gov/Issues/FloorSpeechSummary.aspx|title=Issues|website=Congressman Earl Blumenauer}}</ref>
* January 26, 2005: Mr. Speaker, I recently had the opportunity to view the devastation in Southeast Asia as a result of the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake|tsunami]]. As appalled as I was by what I saw, I must confess that occasionally my thoughts drifted back to the United States. What would have happened if last September, [[Hurricane Ivan]] had veered 40 miles to the west, devastating the city of New Orleans? One likely scenario would have had a tsunami-like 30-foot wall of water hitting the city, causing thousands of deaths and $100 billion in damage...The experience of Southeast Asia should convince us all of the urgent need for congressional action to prevent wide-scale loss of life and economic destruction at home and abroad. Prevention and planning will pay off. Maybe the devastation will encourage us to act before disaster strikes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2005/9/4/233718/2082|title=DAMNING Congressional Record: Cries for Help Ignored By The Federal Government [updated]|publisher=}}</ref>

In February 2009, after an incident in [[Connecticut]] wherein a domesticated [[chimpanzee]] severely mauled a woman gained national attention, Blumenauer sponsored the [[Captive Primate Safety Act]] to bar the sale or purchase of non-human [[primate]]s for personal possession between states and from outside of the country.<ref>{{cite web | work=OpenCongress | title=H.R.80 Captive Primate Safety Act | url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h80/show | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213045801/http://www.opencongress.org/bill/111-h80/show | archivedate=February 13, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}</ref> The previous year, in June 2008, Blumenauer had sponsored legislation to ban interstate trafficking of [[great ape]]s, which had passed in the House but been tabled by the [[United States Senate|Senate]].<ref>{{cite news | agency=The Oregonian | first=Charles | last=Pope | title=House passes Blumenauer bill to restrict primate sales | date=February 24, 2009 | url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/02/house_passes_blumenauer_bill_t.html}}</ref>

Blumenauer has received some media attention during the [[Health care reform debate in the United States|political debate]] over [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform]] for sponsoring an amendment to the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]] to change current procedures to mandate that [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] pay for [[End-of-life (medical treatment)|end-of-life]] counseling.<ref>{{cite news | agency=[[The Associated Press]] | first=Ricardo | last=Alonso-Zaldivar | title=It's alive!
