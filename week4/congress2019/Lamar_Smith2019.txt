{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2006}}
In 2006, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] threw out the 23rd District in ''[[League of United Latin American Citizens v. Perry]]'' on the grounds that it violated the rights of Latino voters.  The 23rd is the largest district in the nation (not counting the at-large districts), stretching across 800 road miles from [[El Paso]] to San Antonio.  Due to its size, nearly every district in the El Paso-San Antonio corridor had to be redrawn.  Smith regained most of the Hill Country, but kept a large portion of his share of Austin, including the area around the University of Texas.

In November 2006 the Texas Legislative Council <ref name="SAEN-2-8-06">Gary Martin, [http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020806.en.POLcourage.bush.a7b1b44.html "Courage, other veterans speak out against Bush"], ''San Antonio Express-News'', February 8, 2006. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929100034/http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/metro/stories/MYSA020806.en.POLcourage.bush.a7b1b44.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> found that nearly two-thirds of voters in District 21 cast ballots for statewide Republican candidates in 2004.
