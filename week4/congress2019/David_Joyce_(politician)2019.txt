===Elections===
;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Ohio, 2012#District 14}}
In July 2012, U.S. Congressman [[Steve LaTourette]] of [[Ohio's 14th congressional district]] announced that he would be retiring in 2012, rather than seek re-election. Joyce was appointed as the replacement nominee on the Republican ticket.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sherman|first1=Jake|title=Steve LaTourette blames polarizing climate for departure |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0712/79168.html|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=Politico|date=2012-07-30}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Gomez|first1=Henry|title=Northeast Ohio GOP leaders choose David Joyce to replace outgoing Rep.

Joyce ran in the November general election against perennial [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Dale Virgil Blanchard]], [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] David Macko and [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate Elaine Mastromatteo. Joyce won the election with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title=2012 Ohio House Results |url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/results/house/ohio/|accessdate=11 July 2014|publisher=Politico}}</ref>

;2014
In February 2013, Roll Call reported that Steve Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had names Joyce's seat as one of the party's top four targets in 2014. The House Majority PAC made Joyce one of its top targets to oust in the 2014 elections.<ref>Terkel, Amanda; Rep. Dave Joyce On Unfilled Jobs: Businesses Can’t Find Enough ‘Sober,’ ‘Drug-Free’ Workers; Huffington Post; August 24, 2013; https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/23/dave-joyce-workers-drug-free_n_3804552.html</ref>

In 2014, according to one news source, Joyce "survived a grueling primary against a [[tea party]]-backed candidate," and then faced "an equally tough challenge from Michael Wager."<ref>Warsmith, Stephanie; U.S. Rep. David Joyce faces another serious challenge as Democrat Michael Wager seeks 14th District seat in pricey race; Acron Beacon Journal; October 22, 2014; https://www.ohio.com/akron/news/politics/u-s-rep-david-joyce-faces-another-serious-challenge-as-democrat-michael-wager-seeks-14th-district-seat-in-pricey-race</ref>

David Joyce won 63.3% of the vote, with Wager receiving 33% and independent David Macko winning 3.7%.<ref>Ohio Election Results; New york Times; https://www.nytimes.com/elections/2014/ohio-elections</ref>

;2018
In April 2017, Betsy Rader, a Democrat, announced that she would be running against Joyce in 2018. Rader is a lawyer who represents victims of employment discrimination. Rader said that she supported "much" of the Affordable Care Act, but admitted that health care was "an issue I've got to study more." Rader criticized Joyce for opposing an increase in the minimum wage and for wanting to withdraw federal funding for Planned Parenthood.<ref>Peltzer; Jeremy; Democrat Betsy Rader will seek to challenge U.S. Rep.

In October 2017, Pastor [[Darrell C. Scott|Darrell Scott]], CEO of President Trump's National Diversity Coalition, announced he was thinking of running against Joyce in 2018 for the GOP Congressional nomination. He said that the district needed someone who stood more firmly with the President. Charlie Frye, Chairman of the Ashtabula Republican Party, supported Scott, saying he liked Joyce but did not like the way he votes.<ref>Wollet, Brian; Trump Diversity Director Pastor Darrell Scott Considering Run For Congress Against Dave Joyce; Big League Politics; October 21, 2017; https://bigleaguepolitics.com/trump-diversity-director-pastor-darrell-scott-considering-run-congress-dave-joyce/</ref>

=== Tenure ===
Asked about his legislative priorities in March 2016, Joyce cited terrorist threats, job growth, government spending, the national debt, environmental protection of the Great Lakes, and health care.<ref>David Joyce, candidate for U.S. Representative Ohio 14th District seat, March 2016 primary election;The News Herald; http://www.news-herald.com/government-and-politics/20160308/david-joyce-candidate-for-us-representative-ohio-14th-district-seat-march-2016-primary-election</ref>

[[Richard Lugar#The Lugar Center|The Lugar Center]] and the [[McCourt School of Public Policy]] ranked Joyce as the 29th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the [[114th United States Congress]] and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio.<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.thelugarcenter.org/assets/htmldocuments/The%20Lugar%20Center%20-%20McCourt%20School%20Bipartisan%20Index%20114th%20Congress%20House%20Scores.pdf|title=The Lugar Center - McCourt School Bipartisan Index|publisher=[[Richard Lugar#The Lugar Center|The Lugar Center]]|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

In July 2017, Joyce said that political discourse in the U.S. had reached a "vitriolic" level. "I do know there's a level of frustration out there," he said. "But we need to work together. [President Donald Trump] has gotten into this tug-of-war with the national media. Now we're six months into his presidency ... and infrastructure improvements, tax changes and healthcare law are not getting covered. They are dealing with the Tweet du Jour ... and [Trump's tweets] certainly don't help."<ref>Schunk, Andrew; Congressman Dave Joyce talks health care, discord over discourse; MyTown NEO; July 6, 2017; http://www.mytownneo.com/news/20170706/congressman-dave-joyce-talks-health-care-discord-over-discourse</ref>

Joyce is a member of the [[Republican Main Street Partnership]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Members|author=|url=https://republicanmainstreet.org/members/|format=|publisher=Republican Mains Street Partnership|date=|accessdate=4 October 2017}}</ref> and the [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Members|author=|url=https://royce.house.gov/internationalconservation/members.html|format=|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives International Conservation Caucus |date=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref>

;Health care
In July 2017, Joyce expressed the view that the only viable route to a consensus on health care was to take a bipartisan approach. While admitting that Obamacare was "going to fail" he said that the drafting of the GOP's then-current Senate health-care bill was "even worse than how the Affordable Care Act evolved" and that the GOP's House health-care bill "was too partisan" and that there "is nothing in this Senate bill, that is going to bring down the cost of healthcare."<ref>Schunk, Andrew; Congressman Dave Joyce talks health care, discord over discourse; MyTown NEO; July 6, 2017; http://www.mytownneo.com/news/20170706/congressman-dave-joyce-talks-health-care-discord-over-discourse</ref>

;Jobs 
In an August 2013 speech, Joyce said that part of the problem with the jobs issue was that there are "3 million jobs every month in this country that go unfilled." He noted that the ''Cleveland Plain Dealer'' had fact-checked this number and had "actually came up with a higher number than 3 million." The trouble, he explained, is that employers "can't find people to come to work sober, daily, drug-free and want to learn the necessary skills going forward to be able to do those jobs."<ref>Terkel, Amanda; Rep. Dave Joyce On Unfilled Jobs: Businesses Can’t Find Enough ‘Sober,’ ‘Drug-Free’ Workers; Huffington Post; August 24, 2013; https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/23/dave-joyce-workers-drug-free_n_3804552.html</ref>

;Military and intelligence 
In March 2016, Joyce emphasized his support for the military and intelligence communities. He noted his votes for the strengthening of the Visa Waiver Program in order to "ensure terrorists with Western passports don't enter our country," for restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, and for enhancements in cybersecurity infrastructure. He said, in summary, that he was "committed to giving our soldiers and our intelligence community all of the resources they need to do the job."<ref>David Joyce, candidate for U.S. Representative Ohio 14th District seat, March 2016 primary election;The News Herald; March 8, 2016; http://www.news-herald.com/government-and-politics/20160308/david-joyce-candidate-for-us-representative-ohio-14th-district-seat-march-2016-primary-election</ref>

;Immigration and terrorism
Also in March 2016, Joyce said that he had co-sponsored "several bills that ensured refugees underwent stricter scrutiny in order to prevent a Paris-style attack from happening in the United States."<ref>David Joyce, candidate for U.S. Representative Ohio 14th District seat, March 2016 primary election;The News Herald; March 8, 2016; http://www.news-herald.com/government-and-politics/20160308/david-joyce-candidate-for-us-representative-ohio-14th-district-seat-march-2016-primary-election</ref>

;Transportation
In 2014, Joyce introduced the Safe Streets Act with Congresswoman [[Doris Matsui]]. The bill would nationalize transportation "design elements" so that streets would be designed with the safety of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists in mind.<ref>Martin, Aaron. [http://riponadvance.com/news/bipartisan-measure-improve-road-safety/6537 "Bipartisan measure would improve road safety"]. ''Ripon Advance''. February 10, 2014. (Retrieved 02-11-14).</ref>
