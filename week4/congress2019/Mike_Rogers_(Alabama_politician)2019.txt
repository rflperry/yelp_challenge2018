'''Michael Dennis Rogers''' (born July 16, 1958) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Alabama|3|}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life and education==
A fifth generation resident of [[Calhoun County, Alabama|Calhoun County]] in East Alabama, Rogers graduated from Saks High School<ref>{{cite web|url=http://sakshighschool.org/alumni/4614800/mike-rogers.html|title=Mike  Rogers - Saks High School - Anniston, AL|website=sakshighschool.org|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> and earned both his undergraduate degree in Political Science and Masters of Public Administration at [[Jacksonville State University]] in [[Jacksonville, Alabama]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsu.edu/news/notable-alumni.html|title=Jacksonville State University -|website=www.jsu.edu|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsu.edu/news/july_dec2007/photofeature-CPS_Rogers.html|title=JSU News Wire|website=www.jsu.edu|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref>

== Early political career ==
At 28 years old, Rogers became the youngest person to join the Calhoun County Commission.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.annistonstar.com/news/gerald-willis-public-servant-and-businessman-dies-at/article_a01590ba-b3e2-11e4-a3f9-f7638a5f03c2.html|title=Gerald Willis, public servant and businessman, dies at 75|first=Laura Gaddy, Star Staff Writer,|last=lbgaddy@annistonstar.com|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref>

In 1994, he won a seat in the [[Alabama House of Representatives]], and became Minority leader in his second term. In 2002, Bob Riley successfully ran for governor, leaving the 3rd district vacant. Rogers easily won the Republican nomination. In the general election, he faced Democratic veteran Joe Turnham, Jr., who had served three years as state party chairman and had run against Riley in the congressional election in 1998.<ref>"Riley a Rerun in U.S. House," ''The Anniston Star'', November 4, 1998, p. 1A</ref>

== U.S. House of Representatives ==

=== Tenure ===

In December 2011, Rogers voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required Congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/michael-rogers-0 |title=Mike Rogers &#124; Congressional Scorecard – FreedomWorks |publisher=Congress.freedomworks.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref>

==Political positions==

In 2008, he received a rating of 50% from the [[American Conservative Union]], one of the most moderate voting records of a Southern Republican for that year.<ref>[http://www.acuratings.org/2008house.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016180313/http://www.acuratings.org/2008house.htm |date=October 16, 2009 }}</ref> Rogers supported an amendment to declare that people retain the right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property, including schools. He cosponsored legislation to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Rogers sponsored a bill expressing the continued support of Congress for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/mike-rogers/legislation/co_spons_bills.shtml Congressman Mike Rogers: Official Website] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060824212807/http://www.house.gov/mike-rogers/legislation/co_spons_bills.shtml |date=August 24, 2006 }}</ref> He also introduced legislation making it illegal to satirize or in any way parody the Transportation Security Administration.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rogers|first=Mike|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr3011|title=Transportation Security Administration Authorization Act of 2011|publisher=govtrack.us|accessdate=2011-10-15}}</ref>

===Economic issues===

Rogers is a signer of [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]’s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref name="ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref> He voted in favor of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].<ref name="Almukhtar122117">{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}</ref>

=== Foreign affairs ===
In June 2016, he called for the [[United States withdrawal from the United Nations]] in the wake of the [[Brexit]] vote by the [[United Kingdom]] to [[Withdrawal from the European Union|withdraw from the European Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://yellowhammernews.com/politics-2/wake-brexit-alabama-congressman-wants-u-s-leave-u-n/|title=In the wake of Brexit, Alabama congressman wants U.S. to exit U.N. - Yellowhammer News|date=26 June 2016|publisher=|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> On January 3, 2017, Rogers once again called for the US to withdrawal from the United Nations by introducing the "American Sovereignty Act of 2017" to the House of Representatives.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.ky3.com/content/news/A-proposal-for-the-US-to-pull-out-of-the-UN-411451915.html|title=A proposal for the U.S. to pull out of the U.N.|last=Forhetz|first=Sara|language=en|access-date=2017-01-23}}</ref> The bill is currently in the introductory state and still needs House, Senate, and presidential approval.

==Political campaigns==
In a very close election, the Turnham-Rogers contest was one of the most closely watched in 2002. Both Democratic and Republican National parties targeted the district, with Speaker Dennis Hastert promising Rogers a seat on the Armed Services committee should he win.  Rogers heavily outspent Turnham, raising and spending $1,656,290<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_02+H2AL03032|title=sdrdc.com|website=herndon1.sdrdc.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> to Turnham's $1,015,132,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_02+H8AL03039|title=sdrdc.com|website=herndon1.sdrdc.com|accessdate=26 October 2017}}</ref> with Rogers enjoying an even greater margin in independent expenditures.  Rogers narrowly won the election by a 50%–48% margin.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2002/AL-2002-General-Certification.pdf |title=Alabama Secretary of State: Certification of Results, 2002 General Election |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100316214044/http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2002/AL-2002-General-Certification.pdf |archivedate=2010-03-16 |df= }}</ref>  In this election, Rogers became a rare Republican endorsee of ''[[The Anniston Star]]''.<ref>"For Congress," ''The Anniston Star'', October 22, 2002, p. 8A</ref>

However, Rogers has only faced one other contest nearly that close. In 2008, Joshua Segall held him to only 54 percent of the vote—the only time since his initial election that Rogers has fallen below 59 percent of the vote.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

* '''2008''' Rogers won against Democratic nominee [[Joshua Segall]], a [[Montgomery, Alabama|Montgomery]] attorney, and Independent Mark Layfield. {{citation needed | date=February 2014}}

* '''2010''' Rogers defeated Democratic nominee Steve Segrest. {{citation needed | date=February 2014}}

===Campaign contributions from ARMPAC===

Rogers was a recipient of former [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]'s [[ARMPAC]] campaign contributions.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://ourfuture.org/media_releases/new-data-26-congressmen-bought-out-rep-delay |title=Campaign for America's Future: 26 Congressmen Bought Out by Rep. DeLay |publisher=Ourfuture.org |date= |accessdate=2014-01-05}}</ref> DeLay was prosecuted and convicted on charges of felony money laundering of campaign finances and conspiracy to launder money. As of August 2016, Rogers has not offered to return any of the $30,000 he received.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thetuskegeenews.com/opinion/mike-rogers-operates-under-his-own-double-standard/article_8c436c7a-1afa-590e-84cc-86bfe4c45aab.html|title=Mike Rogers operates under his own double standard|date=2016-08-04 |accessdate=2017-01-22|author=Smith, Jesse}}</ref> Rogers said that DeLay is innocent until proven guilty, and that he would not return the money "while the judicial process runs its course."<ref>[https://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/051009/delay.shtml "Allies to Keep DeLay's Money," ''The Decatur Daily'', October 9, 2005, p. 1A] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160324083354/https://legacy.decaturdaily.com/decaturdaily/news/051009/delay.shtml |date=March 24, 2016 }}</ref>
