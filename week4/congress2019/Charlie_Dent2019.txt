In April 2011, Dent voted in favor of a 2012 budget proposal authored by [[Paul Ryan]] entitled ''[[The Path to Prosperity]]'', which included several controversial changes to both health care and tax policy. Dent said of the bill that, "It's a serious, sober document ... There are some things in there that I think are interesting."<ref>{{Cite news|author1=Miller, Sean J.|author2=D'Aprile, Shane|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/154161-gop-vulnerable-members-cautiously-embrace-ryan-budget|title=Vulnerables offer praise for Ryan plan|work=Ballot Box: The Hill's Campaign Blog|publisher=The Hill|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

Dent, after announcing his retirement during late 2017, stated dealing with the "freewheeling president" became "exhausting". According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', he stated "disorder, chaos, instability, uncertainty, intemperate statements" were not "conservative virtues".<ref>{{cite web|last1=Zanona|first1=Melanie|title=Retiring GOP lawmakers cut loose on Trump|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/382028-retiring-gop-lawmakers-cut-loose-on-trump|website=The Hill|accessdate=April 9, 2018}}</ref> He delivered a farewell speech on May 10,<ref>{{cite news|title=Transcript: U.S. Rep.

====Citizenship and immigration====
In April 2010, Dent introduced a resolution urging the [[U.S. State Department]] to issue a [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]] to [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. He said al-Awlaki "preaches a culture of hate" and had been a functioning member of al-Qaeda "since before 9/11", and had effectively renounced his citizenship by engaging in treasonous acts.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Levine, Mike|url=http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/04/22/rep-introduces-resolution-strip-radical-cleric-us-citizenship|title=Rep.

In January 2012, Dent co-sponsored the [[Enemy Expatriation Act]] with Senator [[Joe Lieberman]]. The bill's purpose was 'To add engaging in or supporting hostilities against the United States to the list of acts for which United States nationals would lose their nationality', where the term "hostilities" means any conflict subject to the laws of war.<ref name="Toby1">{{cite web|last1=(112th Congress)|first1=H.

Dent criticized President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to temporarily curtail Muslim immigration until better screening methods are devised. He stated that “This is ridiculous. I guess I understand what his intention is, but unfortunately the order appears to have been rushed through without full consideration. You know, there are many, many nuances of immigration policy that can be life or death for many innocent, vulnerable people around the world.”<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump’s travel ban; here’s where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

The bill would "lower the quorum on the board so it could approve large loans once more." As of 2018, the reopened bank has a seven-member board that lacks a quorum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Scott|title=Five things lawmakers want attached to the $1 trillion funding bill|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/377682-five-things-lawmakers-want-attached-to-the-1-trillion-funding-bill|website=The Hill|accessdate=March 10, 2018}}</ref>

Dent is known for his efforts to promote LGBT equality throughout the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phillymag.com/gphilly/2013/06/17/pa-congressman-charlie-dent-co-sponsor-lgbt-specific-anti-bullying-bill|title=Pennsylvania Congressman Charlie Dent to co-sponsor LGBT-specific anti-bullying Bill|last1=Middleton|first1=Josh|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=Philly Magazine|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

====Energy====
Dent is a proponent of [[hydrogen fuel]] and is one of the four founding members of the House Hydrogen Fuel Cell Caucus. In 2006 he proposed legislation aimed at promoting the rollout of commercial hydrogen fueling stations.

====Drug policy====
Dent is a proponent of drug prohibition, and is outspoken on the dangers of novel [[designer drug|synthetic drugs]], having personally sponsored several bills aimed to schedule new psychoactive compounds. In 2011, he sponsored the [[Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2011]], which sought to schedule a large number of [[Synthetic cannabinoids|cannabimimetic agents]], as well as 26 other [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive substances]]. The bill passed the House but did not make its way through the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/1254|title=Text – H.R.1254 – 112th Congress (2011–2012): Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2011 – Congress.gov – Library of Congress|date=May 14, 2017|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> On March 27, 2017, the bill was re-introduced as the Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2017.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/1732/text|title=H.R.1732 – 115th Congress (2017–2018): Synthetic Drug Control Act of 2017 – Congress.gov – Library of Congress|date=May 14, 2017|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 14, 2017}}</ref> If passed in its current text (as of May 14, 2017), this bill would schedule a large number of novel psychoactive substances, including 96 [[phenethylamine]]s, 94 [[Synthetic cannabinoids|cannabimimetic agents]], 15 [[arylcyclohexylamine]]s, 21 [[tryptamine]]s, 8 [[benzylpiperazine]]s, 4 [[benzodiazepine]]s, 4 [[Opioid|opioid or opioid-like substances]], 8 [[piperazine]]s, and 2 [[tropane alkaloid]]s.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

====Social====
As a Republican representing a district with Democratic leanings, he sometimes crosses party lines on legislation.
