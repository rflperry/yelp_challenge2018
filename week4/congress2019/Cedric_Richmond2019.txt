In an across-the-aisle gesture which was rare in Congress at the time, Richmond in 2014 defended his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] colleague [[Vance McAllister]], who had become embroiled in an alleged adultery scandal. Richmond associated the controversy with "gotcha moments" in which the "two parties in this country have gone overboard...and taken joy in the pain of their supposed opponents".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/04/post_557.html|title=Richmond reaches out to McAllister: He admonishes both parties|date=2014-04-11 |accessdate=2014-04-11|newspaper=Times-Picayune|page=A3|location=New Orleans|first=Bruce|last=Alpert}}</ref>

On June 9, 2014, Richmond introduced the [[Honor Flight Act (H.R. 4812; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) to establish a process for providing expedited and dignified [[Transportation Security Administration#Screening processes and regulations|passenger screening services]] for [[veterans]] traveling on an [[Honor Flight]] to visit [[war memorials]] built and dedicated to honor their service.<ref name=4812sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4812 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4812 |publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>

On November 30, 2016, Richmond was elected to chair the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in the [[115th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Rainey|first=Richard|title=Cedric Richmond elected chair of Congressional Black Caucus|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=November 30, 2016 |url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/cedric_richmond_elected_chair.html |accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

===Elections===

Richmond came in third place in the seven-candidate primary election for the Democratic nomination for [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]], behind U.S. Representative [[William J. Jefferson]] and television newscaster [[Helena Moreno]]. During a primary debate, Richmond attempted to discredit Moreno with accusations of drug use, while she attempted to attack his personal integrity by bringing up his disqualification from the 2005 New Orleans City Council "D" District election.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donze|first=Frank|title=Moreno, Richmond trade barbs at 2nd District talk |publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=September 26, 2008|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/moreno_richmond_trade_barbs_at.html|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref> Later in 2008, Richmond's law license was suspended for 6 months by the State Supreme Court in a 5–2 decision after it was found that he falsified a sworn statement claiming greater than 2 years residency in New Orleans' "D" District in order to be eligible for the district's City Council position.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donze|first=Frank|title=State Rep.

Richmond challenged Republican incumbent [[Joseph Cao|Anh “Joseph” Cao]] for {{ushr|LA|2}}.

Richmond was the first candidate in the 2010 elections to have President [[Barack Obama]] appear in a television ad on his behalf.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burns|first=Alexander|title=La.'s Richmond gets Obama's 1st ad|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/1010/big_easy_pitch_97e78eff-3743-4040-834b-fe0474415f37.html|accessdate=October 4, 2010|newspaper=Politico|date=October 4, 2010}}</ref>

Most pundits reckoned Richmond as a heavy favorite to retake the seat for the Democrats, even in what was forecast to be a Republican year nationally. With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+25, the 2nd was far and away the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. The next most Democratic district on that list, [[Delaware's At-large congressional district]], had a PVI of D+7. In 2008 Obama had carried the 2nd with a 74 percent of the vote, his fifth-best performance in a Southern district and his 35th best nationally.

Richmond won the November 2, 2010 election in the heavily Democratic [[majority-minority district]] with 65 percent of the vote.<ref name="Krupa">{{cite news|last1=Krupa|first1=Michelle|last2=Donze|first2=Frank|title=Cedric Richmond wins 2nd District House race; Joseph Cao concedes|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=November 2, 2010|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/cedric_richmond_wins_anh_josep.html|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In 2008 Richmond had his law license suspended for two months following a Louisiana Supreme Court decision in response to his false testimony that he had lived in District D for more than two years when he ran for a seat on the New Orleans City Council.<ref>{{cite web|last=Morrow |first=Brendan |url=http://heavy.com/news/2017/03/cedric-richmond-5-fast-facts-you-need-to-know/ |title=Cedric Richmond: 5 Fast Facts You Need to Know |website=Heavy.com |date=2017-03-02 |accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref>

In January 2017, Richmond became involved in an argument with Republican lawmakers over the right to have a painting continue to hang in the Capitol. The painting in question shows police officers apprehending suspects, and the police are depicted as pigs.<ref name="painting1">{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/313506-dem-lawmaker-re-hangs-painting-depicting-cops-as-pigs-in-capitol  |title=Democrat re-hangs painting depicting cops as pigs |last=Marcos |first=Cristina |date=January 13, 2017 |website= |publisher=The Hill |access-date=January 13, 2017 |quote=The painting has inflamed tensions on Capitol Hill between the two parties.  The Hill asked Rep. Cedric Richmond (D-La.), chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus, if the painting would need someone to monitor it around the clock to prevent further removals.  "No," Richmond replied. "We might just have to kick somebody's ass and stop them, though."  }}</ref>  Richmond said that if the painting continues to be removed, "We may just have to kick somebody's ass."<ref name="painting1"/>  He went on to say that escalating the issue may "open up Pandoras Box" because there are other paintings that some people may also find offensive.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/congress-artwork-animals-cops-congressional-black-caucus-gop-233409  |title=CBC: ‘We may just have to kick somebody’s ass’ over painting removal |last= |first= |date=January 10, 2017 |website= |publisher=Politico |access-date=January 13, 2017 |quote=Richmond said any escalation of the issue might "open up Pandora's Box." “I’m looking at some paintings that people could probably find some offense to," he said. "So you just open up Pandora’s Box to, I think, anarchy when it comes to the art around this building." "I think it would be a bad move. I think politically it would be an awful move to do that," he continued. }}</ref>

In March 2017 Richmond was criticized for making a crude joke about a controversial photograph of [[Kellyanne Conway]] kneeling on the Oval Office couch. Richmond appeared to compare Conway to [[Monica Lewinsky]], saying "I really just want to know what was going on there, because she really looked kind of familiar there in that position there. But don't answer. And I don't want you to refer back to the ’90s.” Richmond later explained that the joke was not meant to be sexual.<ref name="washingtonpost1">{{cite news|last=Heil |first=Emily |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/reliable-source/wp/2017/03/02/rep-cedric-richmond-made-an-awkward-joke-about-kellyanne-conway-but-he-says-it-wasnt-meant-to-be-sexual/ |title=Rep. Cedric Richmond made an awkward joke about Kellyanne Conway, but he says it wasn’t meant to be sexual |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date= |accessdate=2017-07-10}}</ref>

Richmond in fact, did not apologize, he only clarified his remarks by stating “Since some people have interpreted my joke to mean something that it didn’t I think it is important to clarify what I meant, ” he said in a statement. “Where I grew up saying that someone is looking or acting ‘familiar’ simply means that they are behaving too comfortably.” <ref name="washingtonpost1"/>

===Sports===
Richmond is a player for the annual [[Congressional Baseball Game]]. Richmond was the starting Democratic pitcher for each of the five years since his election and the Democrats won each game. He had a 2.85 [[earned run average]], 1.67 [[walks plus hits per inning pitched]] and 45 [[strikeouts]] in his 27 innings pitched in that span. In 2016, Republican team [[manager (baseball)|manager]] [[Joe Barton]] called him the best player to ever participate in the game.<ref name="roll call">{{cite news|last1=Gangitano|first1=Alex|title=Cedric Richmond: Congressional Baseball’s Best Player Ever?|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/hoh/cedric-richmond-congressional-baseball-game-best-player-ever-democrats-joe-barton|accessdate=16 June 2017|work=[[Roll Call]]|date=23 June 2016}}</ref> Richmond lost his first game in 2016, a day after participating through the night in the [[2016 United States House of Representatives sit-in]].<ref name="paulkane" />
