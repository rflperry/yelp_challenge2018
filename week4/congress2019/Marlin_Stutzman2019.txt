Stutzman consistently received 90% ratings or above from the Chamber of Commerce and other small business associations for his support of pro-business legislation.  In 2008 he won the Small Business Champion Award <ref>{{cite web|author=InsideINdianaBusiness.com Report |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=27433 |title=Indy Firm Named Chamber's Small Business of the Year – Newsroom – Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2008-01-22 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229133135/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?id=27433 |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}</ref> from the Indiana Chamber of Commerce.

===Government waste===
Stutzman advocates for more accountability in state government operations.  He co-authored a bill to establish the Hoosier Grace Commission which passed in 2003.  The commission helped eliminate wasteful state government spending and has brought fraud and/or scandals to public awareness.<ref>{{cite web|author=May 15th, 2008 at 10:48 pm by Jim |url=http://hoosieraccess.com/blog/2008/05/15/marlin-stutzman-declares-for-senate-district-13-caucus-to-replace-senator-meeks/ |title=Blog Archive » Marlin Stutzman Declares for Senate District 13 Caucus to Replace Senator Meeks |publisher=HoosierAccess |date=2008-05-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

===Education===
Stutzman authored a bill that required more money to go directly to the classroom.  The bill was instrumental in paying back the $600 million that was owed by state government to schools, and increased funding for students six years in a row.

===Affordable Care Act===
In Congress, Stutzman has opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. In September 2013, he advocated attaching a measure defunding the Act to must-pass legislation funding the federal government.<ref>'This is the line in the sand,' House Republicans say, by Lisa Mascaro, LA Times, 18 September 2013</ref>

After the government subsequently shut down, Stutzman remarked that the issue at stake was no longer merely the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], and Republicans would need some concession in order to reopen the government.<ref>{{cite web|last=Hayward |first=Steven F. |url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/gop-stands-firm-against-funding-bill-will-link-to-debt-ceiling-fight/article/2536750 |title=GOP stands firm against funding bill, will link to debt ceiling fight |publisher=WashingtonExaminer.com |date=2013-10-03 |accessdate=2013-10-09}}</ref>
