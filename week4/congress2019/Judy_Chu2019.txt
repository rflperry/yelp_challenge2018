;Defense of Civil Liberties
Chu opposed the "See Something, Say Something Act of 2011," which provides "immunity for reports of suspected terrorist activity or suspicious behavior and response." She said, "if a person contacts law enforcement about something based solely on someone's race, religion, ethnicity, or national origin, they would not receive immunity from civil lawsuits."<ref>{{cite web|last=Kamboj|first=Kirti|title=H.R. 963: The 'See a Minority, Report a Terrorist' Act of 2011?|url=http://www.hyphenmagazine.com/blog/archive/2011/08/hr-963-see-minority-report-terrorist-act-2011|work=Hyphen Magazine|publisher=Hyphen Magazine|accessdate=4 September 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Dye|first=Shawn|title=Watch Rep.

;Apology for the Chinese Exclusion Act
On June 18, 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution, introduced by Congresswoman Chu, that formally expresses the ''regret'' of the House of Representatives for the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], which imposed almost total restrictions on Chinese immigration and naturalization and denied Chinese-Americans basic freedoms because of their ethnicity. This was only the fourth time that the U.S. Congress issued an apology to a group of people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hres683|title=H.Res. 683 (112th)|accessdate=August 9, 2012|author=112th Congress (2012)|date=June 8, 2012 |work=Legislation|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Expressing the regret of the House of Representatives for the passage of laws that adversely affected the Chinese in the United States, including the Chinese Exclusion Act.}}</ref>

;Ethics
In June 2011 the House Ethics Committee began an investigation after receiving information suggesting that two of Chu's top aides had directed staffers to do campaign tasks during regular work hours.  In the course of the investigation it was found that Chu had sent two emails to her staff on how to respond to aspects of the Ethics Committee's inquiry.  While the Committee found no evidence to support that Chu was aware of the actions of her staff, they did find that the emails represented actions that interfered with the committee's investigation of the matter, and on December 11, 2014, Rep. Chu was formally reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee for interfering with their investigation of her office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/APPENDIX%20A.pdf |title=Official Letter of Reproval US House of Representatives, Committee on Ethics |publisher=US House |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name="nj121114">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/chu-gingrey-rebuked-by-house-ethics-panel-20141211 |title=Chu, Gingrey Rebuked by House Ethics Panel |author=House, Billy |publisher=''[[National Journal]]'' |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>
