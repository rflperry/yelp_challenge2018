[[File:Gwen Moore, official 109th Congress photo.jpg|thumb|left|Congresswoman Gwen Moore]]
Moore was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2004, earning 69.6% of the vote and defeating [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Lawyer|attorney]] Gerald Boyle in the general election. Moore was one of a handful of African-Americans to have been elected to Congress as freshmen in 2004, and she was the first [[African-American]] and second woman (after [[Tammy Baldwin]]) to represent Wisconsin in Congress.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sandler|first=Larry|title=Moore rewrites history: Mainstream appeal makes her state's first black congresswoman|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=MWSB&p_theme=mwsb&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=10624A326F1A1F83&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=November 3, 2004}}</ref>

Moore is a prominent advocate for women's rights, releasing frequent statements on topics ranging from [[domestic abuse]] awareness to abortion rights. In January 2011, she was elected Democratic co-chair of the Congressional Women's Caucus to become a leader on health insurance reform and the protection of reproductive rights.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

During the congressional debate in February 2011 on the Pence Amendment proposing to defund the health services organization Planned Parenthood, in response to comments from [[Paul Broun]] suggesting that Planned Parenthood promoted racist eugenics because more black women than white women have abortions, Moore spoke about her experience raising children on little money, and why "''planned parenthood'' is healthy for women, it's healthy for children and it's healthy for our society".<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5GOCfpE4RQ |title=Rep.

Over the first session of the [[109th Congress]], Moore earned 90% and higher legislative agenda approval scores from [[Planned Parenthood|Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin]], the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]], the [[Sierra Club|Sierra Club of Wisconsin]], and the [[Service Employees International Union]]. Moore has focused herself legislatively on traditional Democratic and [[progressivism|progressive]] issues, believing that the [[Federal government of the United States|federal government]] should play a significant role in the amelioration of poverty and the resolution of difficult local problems. Moore has received support from interest groups ranging from the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (93%), The [[Human Rights Campaign]] (100%), and The National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League ([[NARAL]]) (100%), to The National Farmer's Union (100%) and Defenders of Wildlife Action Fund (100%). She lacks support from those supporting hunting and sportsmen rights (0% support from Sportsmen and Animal Owner's Voting Alliance), pro-lifers (0% support from [[National Right to Life]]), and conservative tax reform stances (0% support from Americans for Tax Reform).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/3457/gwen-moore|title=Gwen Moore - Ratings and Endorsements|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>

During her first term, Moore introduced legislation to provide economic incentives and [[tax cut]]s to small businesses to promote job creation, and also cosponsored legislation supporting community [[block grant]]s, continuing and expanding [[Medicaid]] funding, amending the [[Truth in Lending Act]] to prevent so-called "[[predatory lending]]," and removing troops from [[Iraq]]; Moore also cosponsored two prospective [[amendments]] to the [[United States Constitution|US Constitution]], providing for uniform national election standards and prohibiting gender discrimination under law.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

On May 6, 2006, Moore and eight fellow members of the Congressional Black Caucus were arrested and ticketed for [[unlawful assembly]] and [[disorderly conduct]] after they stepped onto the grounds of the [[Embassy]] of the [[Sudan]] to call attention to the ongoing [[Darfur conflict]] in Sudan. Moore said that the group expected ''ex ante'' to be arrested but that they were pleased to participate in a "peaceful act of [[civil disobedience]]".<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=423968 JS Online: Moore expects arrest in protest] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929132046/http://www.jsonline.com/story/index.aspx?id=423968 |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref>

Moore's son, Sowande Ajumoke Omokunde (then aged 26), was arrested in connection with the November 2, 2004 (Election Day) tire-slashing of official [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] vehicles in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]].
