Honda was also a supporter of the San Jose's successful ballot initiative that raised the city's minimum wage to $10 per hour.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Defense===
As former Chairman of the Afghanistan Taskforce for the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and former Co-Chair of the CPC's Peace and Security Taskforce, Congressman Honda has consistently critiqued the war strategy through a series of Congressional briefings, legislation, published opinion pieces ("Alternative Strategies to Obama's Afghan Agenda", "A Different Kind of Surge"), and Congressional letters to the Administration.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} Honda advocated an orderly withdrawal of U.S. military forces from Afghanistan and a significant realignment of U.S. aid to focus on strengthening government institutions, capacity building, economic development, and humanitarian assistance in Afghanistan. Honda criticized the Obama administration for failing to seek Congressional approval for U.S. military operations in Libya. He is critical of the wide-scale use of drones and is a cosponsor of the Targeted Lethal Force Transparency Act (H.R. 4372) requiring an annual report on the number of civilians and combatants killed and injured in drone strikes.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

===Education===
In 2008, Honda worked with then-Senator Barack Obama to introduce the Enhancing STEM Education Act. Honda introduced the House version, H.R. 6104, and Obama introduced the Senate version, S.3047, on the same day.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/6104|title=H.R.6104 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Act of 2008 &#124; Congress.gov &#124; Library of Congress|publisher=Beta.congress.gov|date=May 21, 2008|accessdate=April 23, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/senate-bill/3047|title=S.3047 - 110th Congress (2007-08): Enhancing Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics Education Act of 2008|publisher=Library of Congress|date=May 21, 2008|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

The bills sought to enhance the coordination among state and federal governments to improve STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) education by creating a committee on STEM education at the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) and an Office of STEM at the Department of Education, instituting a voluntary State Consortium on STEM education, and creating a National STEM Education Research Repository. Portions of this bill (notably, creating a committee on STEM education at OSTP), as well as Honda's INVENT Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/1492 |title=H.R.1492 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Innovations for our Nation's Vital Educational Needs for Technology Act|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> (which would develop curriculum tools for use in teaching innovation and fostering inventiveness at the K-16 level), were eventually included in the America COMPETES Act reauthorization, which President Obama signed into law on January 4, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/5116/text|title=Text - H.R.5116 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): America Creating Opportunities to Meaningfully Promote Excellence in Technology, Education, and Science Reauthorization Act of 2010|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

Honda led the Congressional authorization for The Equity and Excellence Commission, a commission that began in 2011 and reported its findings to the Secretary of Education in late 2012. The Commission is a federal advisory committee chartered by Congress, operating under the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA); 5 U.S.C., App.2. The commission had 27 members from a range of backgrounds, including education, law, tax, government, business, and civil rights. The committee met 17 times in Washington, DC and across the country. In November 2012, the commission presented its findings in a report titled "For Each and Every Child: A Strategy for Education Equity and Excellence."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foreachandeverychild.org/The_Report.html|title=The Report|publisher=For Each and Every Child|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141125204856/http://foreachandeverychild.org/The_Report.html|archivedate=November 25, 2014}}</ref> The findings focused around five recommendations: (1) restructuring the financing of schools, focusing on equitable resources; (2) supporting quality teachers and school leaders; (3) supporting early childhood education; (4) promoting increased parental engagement; and, (5) addressing changes in accountability and governance in the education system. Opposed by special interests, including the teachers' unions, the commission's recommendations went largely ignored.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Environment===
Honda secured millions of dollars in federal funding for the cleanup and demolition of the former Almaden Air Force Station atop Mt. Umunhum.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Rogers|first1=Paul|title=After 30 years, work to clean up Almaden Air Force Station finally kicks off|url=http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_15480655|website=Inside Bay Area|accessdate=June 5, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140607010603/http://www.insidebayarea.com/argus/ci_15480655|archivedate=June 7, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Contaminated with standard-use hazardous materials during its military use (lead paint, asbestos, etc.), the site was remediated, demolished, and is slated to open for public access in spring 2017. Honda has also advocated for programs such as the Land and Water Conservation Fund.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2014, Honda introduced the Climate Change Education Act (H.R. 4461),<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4461/text|title=Text of H.R. 4461 (113th): Climate Change Education Act (Introduced version)|publisher=GovTrack.us |date=April 10, 2014 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> legislation that aims to improving public understanding of the impact of greenhouse gases on the environment and the steps that individuals and communities can take to combat the global warming crisis.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

In 2014, Honda introduced the Freedom of Faith Act (H.R. 4460).<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4460, To amend the Immigration and Nationality Act to repeal the sunset of the special immigrant non minister religious worker program, via GovTrack.us|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr4460|accessdate=May 19, 2014}}</ref>

Honda has been a defender of the civil rights of American Muslims. Soon after the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, Honda spoke at a convention of the American Muslim Alliance (AMA) on October 2001.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrmea.org/wrmea-archives/231-washington-report-archives-2000-2005/december-2001/3949-muslim-american-activism.html|title=AMA National Convention Urges U.S. to Listen to Muslims|work=Washington Report on Middle East Affairs|date=December 2001|page=84}}</ref> He told those in attendance not to change their identity or name. "My last name is Honda. You cannot be more Japanese than that." The congressman remembered what he and especially his parents had to go through when Pearl Harbor was attacked. "We were taken in a vehicle with windows covered, we had no idea where we were being taken."{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In the [[Quran oath controversy of the 110th United States Congress]], Rep. [[Virgil Goode]] (R-VA) issued a letter to his constituents stating his view that the decision of Representative-elect [[Keith Ellison]] (D-MN) to use the Quran in his swearing-in ceremony is a threat to "the values and beliefs traditional to the United States of America... I fear that in the next century we will have many more Muslims in the United States if we do not adopt the strict immigration policies". In response, Honda penned a response to Goode expressing his surprise and offense by that letter and declaring "No person should be labeled as un-American based on his or her religion, and it is outrageous to cast aspersions on Representative-elect Ellison purely because of his religious background."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.archives2006.ghazali.net/html/muslims_question_gop.html#Honda|title=Muslims question GOP|publisher=Archives2006.ghazali.net|accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref>

===Government reform===
In 2007, Honda voted for the Honest Leadership and Open Government Act of 2007, which was the legislative response to the [[Jack Abramoff]] scandal and introduced comprehensive new transparency requirements for lobbyists and for Members of Congress. In 2012, he cosponsored H.R. 1148, the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act, which criminalized insider trading by Members of Congress and required numerous disclosures.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://insidertrading.procon.org/view.resource.php?resourceID=004520 |title=What is the Stop Trading on Congressional Knowledge (STOCK) Act? |publisher=ProCon.org |date=April 4, 2012 |accessdate=August 8, 2015}}</ref> He voted for H.Res. 895, which created the first-ever independent ethics office, the Office of Congressional Ethics.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Health care===
