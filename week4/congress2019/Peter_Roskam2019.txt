===Foreign policy===
====Israel====
In March 2016, the Israeli newspaper ''Arutz Sheva'' described Roskam's long-term efforts to combat the [[BDS movement]], which he described as "an insidious effort to marginalize Israel" and "part of a longer-term strategy for people not to protest against Israel, but people that actually want Israel destroyed." Roskam noted a law that "makes BDS an issue in America's trade policy, not just Israel's" by ensuring that American "trade negotiators are doing everything they can to push back against European BDS in particular." Roskam complained, however, that the Obama White House had "given mixed signals" on Israel.<ref>Watch: Meet the man leading Congress's war on BDS; Arutz Sheva; March 21, 2016; http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/209692</ref>

====Hezbollah====
In a March 2016 letter to the EU Ambassador in Washington, [[David O’Sullivan]], Roskam and Grace Meng (D-NY) asked that the EU label [[Hezbollah]]'s political wing a terrorist organization. “While the 2013 EU designation of Hezbollah’s military wing was a step in the right direction,” they wrote, “distinguishing between Hezbollah’s military and political arms is a distinction without a difference.”<ref>Two members of US Congress urge the EU to follow example of the Gulf states and designate whole Hezbollah as a terrorist group; EIPA; March 11, 2016; http://eipa.eu.com/2016/03/two-members-of-us-congress-urge-the-eu-to-follow-example-of-the-gulf-states-and-designate-whole-hezbollah-as-a-terrorist-group/</ref>

In 2016, Roskam opposed the [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury Department]]'s grant of a license to [[Airbus]] and [[Boeing]] to deliver planes contracted for by [[Iran Air]].

Roskam received 40% of the vote to Biggert's 45%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1998/ilh.htm|title=1998 U.S. House of Representatives Results|accessdate=April 21, 2006|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050410172430/http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/fe1998/ilh.htm|archivedate=April 10, 2005}}</ref>

In 1999, at Biggert's request, the [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) investigated a mailing sent out by a [[political action committee]] (PAC), the Campaign for Working Families (CWF), in support of Roskam. The FEC did not find the Roskam campaign at fault, but CWF was found to have violated election law. The PAC was led by conservative activist [[Gary Bauer]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqsdocs/00003C0B.pdf|title=Federal Election Commission|accessdate=June 27, 2006|deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927003218/http://eqs.sdrdc.com/eqsdocs/00003C0B.pdf|archivedate=September 27, 2007}}</ref>

In March 2006, Roskam, running unopposed, won the Republican nomination to attempt to fill the seat in the 6th; his former boss, Hyde, was retiring after 32 years in Congress.<ref name="RoskamBio"/> His opponent in the November general election was an [[Iraq War]] veteran, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Tammy Duckworth]]. Hyde endorsed Roskam. The competitive race was called "the nation's most-watched congressional contest" by Eric Krol of the ''[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]].''<ref name="most-watched">Krol, Eric.{{cite news|title=Debate on immigrants stokes race|url=http://www.roskamforcongress.com/blog/comments.cfm?entry_id=10 |format=reprint|work=[[Daily Herald (Arlington Heights)|Daily Herald]]|publisher=Paddock Publications, Inc.|date=October 12, 2006|accessdate=October 18, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004192055/http://www.roskamforcongress.com/blog/comments.cfm?entry_id=10|archivedate=October 4, 2006|deadurl=yes}}</ref>
