'''James Gerlach''' (born February 25, 1955) is the former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|PA|6}}, serving from 2003 to 2015. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Gerlach retired from Congress after completing his sixth term.<ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Aaron|title=Gerlach won't seek reelection|url=http://riponadvance.com/news/gerlach-wont-seek-reelection/6140|accessdate=8 January 2014|newspaper=Ripon Advance|date=8 January 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108232521/http://riponadvance.com/news/gerlach-wont-seek-reelection/6140|archivedate=8 January 2014|df=}}</ref>

==Early life, education and career==
Gerlach was born in [[Ellwood City, Pennsylvania]] to Helen Lorraine (née Fitzgerald) and Jack Allen Gerlach. His father was killed by a drunk driver when he was five years old, leaving his mother to raise three children on her own.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/gerlach.htm|title=jim gerlach|work=ancestry.com|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Lindt|first=Susan|title=Gerlach pumps up party at GOP dinner|url=http://lancasteronline.com/news/gerlach-pumps-up-party-at-gop-dinner/article_69505350-f3cf-5e7a-b071-c20cff2f6940.html|accessdate=28 August 2014|newspaper=Lancaster Online|date=19 May 2009}}</ref> He graduated from [[Dickinson College]] where he became a member of the [[Sigma Chi]] Fraternity and the [[Raven's Claw]] Honorary Society, with a B.A. in [[Political Science]]. He also earned his law degree from [[Dickinson School of Law]] in 1980. During law school, Gerlach worked as a legislative aide in the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]].

In 1985, Gerlach moved back to Ellwood City and worked at the Butler law firm Lindsey & Lutz.  In 1986, he challenged [[Frank LaGrotta]] in the race for state representative but lost.<ref>"All in the Family," ''[[Beaver County Times]]'', 2007-11-15, p. A6.</ref>  In 1987, he returned to [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] to work for the Lamb, Windle & McErlane law firm in West Chester, whose senior partner was then-Chester County Republican Chairman William Lamb.

==Pennsylvania Legislature==
In preparation for the 1990 election against long time Democratic State Rep. [[Samuel Morris (Pennsylvania politician)|Sam Morris]], Gerlach visited 10,000 homes in the 155th District of the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives]], building his campaign around what he saw as the incumbent's inattentiveness to suburban sprawl. According to a local newspaper, the [[Daily Local News]], Gerlach charged that his opponent was "out of touch" with his constituency.

Gerlach proposed expanding open-space preservation by using zoning laws to encourage developers to incorporate open space into development projects, along with the creation of environmental protection authorities.<ref>{{cite news

During the election, Gerlach's Democratic opponents accused the Western Pennsylvania native of moving to [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] for the sole purpose of running against Morris. Gerlach denied that accusation and said he moved to [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]] because he and his wife saw it as "a great place to work and raise our kids." He ultimately defeated Morris by only 23 votes out of 17,000 cast. He was reelected in 1992 with 64 percent of the vote.

Gerlach was elected to the [[Pennsylvania State Senate]] in 1994, with 67 percent of the vote, in the newly re-formed [[Pennsylvania Senate, District 44|44th]] district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Power+plays+in+Pennsylvania.+(Democrats+win+control+of+the...-a014466157 |title=Power plays in Pennsylvania. – Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> He defeated Democrat Barry Robertson (whose campaign was heavily funded by [[Samuel Morris (Pennsylvania politician)|Sam Morris]], Gerlach's opponent four years earlier)<ref>{{cite news| url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/92286601.html?dids=92286601:92286601&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Nov+12%2C+1994&author=SUSAN+TODD%2C+The+Morning+Call&pub=Morning+Call&desc=GERLACH+SPENT+%2452%2C000+TO+WIN+STATE+SENATE'S+44TH+DISTRICT+SEAT&pqatl=google | work=Morning Call | title=Gerlach Spent $52,000 To Win State Senate's 44Th District Seat | first=Susan | last=Todd | date=November 12, 1994}}</ref> in that election, and was re-elected in 1998 without opposition. While in the State Senate, he helped change the state's welfare laws.

While in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives and Pennsylvania Senate, Gerlach worked to sponsor legislation making it easier for the commonwealth's patchwork of municipalities to work together to preserve open space. Gov. [[Tom Ridge]] signed Gerlach's legislation into law in 2000.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Gerlach was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2002 from the newly created 6th District, sometimes called the "Pterodactyl District" because of its unusual shape; it twisted and wound its way through the outer western suburbs of Philadelphia.<ref>[https://www.usatoday.com/news/politicselections/CandidateProfile.aspx?ci=244&oi=H PA-6 Campaign 2004] ''USAToday.com'', accessed October 18th, 2006</ref> Although the district was reportedly drawn to elect a Republican,<ref>Larry Eichel, [https://web.archive.org/web/20011228023753/http://www.fairvote.org/redistricting/reports/remanual/panews.htm#gop GOP Redistricting Gamble Looks Safe]. ''Philadelphia Inquirer'', October 16, 2002. Retrieved October 18, 2006.</ref> he had a somewhat difficult time holding onto it in elections, largely due to the growing Democratic trend in the Philadelphia suburbs.
On January 6, 2014 Gerlach announced that he would not seek reelection, "to spend more time with my wife and family."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/01/06/rep-jim-gerlach-r-pa-wont-seek-reelection/|title=Rep. Jim Gerlach (R-Pa.) won't seek reelection|work=Washington Post|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref>

===Legislative action and stances===
In 2003, Gerlach sponsored a new law mandating a new veterans cemetery in the Philadelphia area within four years. The nearest military cemetery to accept casket burials was located 90 miles from [[Philadelphia]].

Gerlach has strongly supported Schuylkill Valley commuter rail. At one point he said of the Bush administration's plan to cut federal money for construction costs from 80 percent to 50 percent: "There's just not going to be enough state and local funds to do the project. It will be a dead project."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/244.html|title=News from The Associated Press|work=ap.org|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref>

The [[farmland preservation|farmland-preservation]] and open-space advocacy that Gerlach became known for during his tenure as a state legislator has continued during his congressional career. On Sept. 27, 2006, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a Gerlach-sponsored bill H.R. 5313 that would make federal funds available to municipalities around the country to purchase conservation easements.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c109:2:./temp/~c109uUiCev:: H.R. 5313]</ref> This bill was never acted on by the Senate, and was re-introduced as [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?tab=main&bill=h110-1152 H.R. 1152] in March 2007.

Gerlach has advocated the passage of legislation that would expand federal regulation of so-called "puppy mills," and cosponsored medical liability legislation.

Gerlach voted against H. Con. Res. 63, which disapproved of [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007|The Surge]]; he said it was meaningless, fundamentally vague and would damage troop morale.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/cgi-bin/vote.asp?year=2007&rollnumber=99 FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 99]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2007_record&page=H1811&position=all |title=Retrieve Pages |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

He was one of four Pennsylvania Republicans (the others were [[Todd Platts]], [[Charlie Dent]], and [[Phil English]]) to vote to add sexual orientation and gender identity to the federal hate crimes bill. Mr. Gerlach also opposes the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], which would have amended the constitution to define marriage as a union between one man and one woman. In 2007, however, Gerlach voted against a bill that would have repealed "Don't Ask, Don't Tell."<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Voting Record">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=5226|title=Project Vote Smart – The Voter's Self Defense System|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> In 2010, Gerlach also voted against the "2010-2011 Defense Appropriations Act," which would have included a repeal of "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" after military certification and review.<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Voting Record"/> Gerlach defended this vote, saying, "Voting on this issue six months before Defense Secretary Robert Gates is scheduled to issue a thorough review of the policy and how best to implement any changes does nothing to improve the security of our country or the morale of the brave men and women serving in our military."<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Speeches and Statements">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech.php?can_id=5226|title=Project Vote Smart – The Voter's Self Defense System|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> In 2007-2008, Gerlach received a 64 percent support rating from the [[Family Research Council]],<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Interest Group Ratings">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=5226|title=Project Vote Smart – The Voter's Self Defense System|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> an interest group whose mission statement commits it to being an organization that "shapes public debate and formulates public policy that values human life and upholds the institutions of marriage and the family."<ref name="Family Research Council Mission Statement">{{cite web|url=http://www.frc.org/mission-statement|title=Family Research Council|work=frc.org|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref>

In 2010, Gerlach voted against the "Health Care and Insurance Law Amendments," also known as HR 3590 or "The Health Care Reform Bill." <ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Voting Record"/> In a statement on the Health Care vote, Gerlach stated that the bill was "written behind closed doors," and that it "ushers in a new era of big government." <ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Speeches and Statements"/> Gerlach also expressed concerns about the bill's impact on his constituents, saying "In my district, innovation, investment and jobs in the life sciences and biotechnology sector will be at risk because of a new $2 billion per year tax on items used for cancer screening, knee and hip replacement surgery and other life-saving procedures."<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Speeches and Statements"/>

In 2009, Gerlach opposed HR 2454, which was designed to amend several laws related to energy and the environment, and included a "cap-and-trade" program to limit greenhouse gas emissions.<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Voting Record"/> As Gerlach later explained, "While the bill included some positive provisions to develop alternative and renewable energy our country needs, I voted against this bill because of the devastating effect it will have on working families and the people who create jobs in my district and across Pennsylvania." <ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Speeches and Statements"/> The League of Conservation Voters, "a national non-profit organization that works to turn environmental values into national priorities,"<ref name="Project Vote Smart on the League of Conservation Voters">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=4764|title=Project Vote Smart – The Voter's Self Defense System|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref> rated Gerlach at 44 percent on their National Environmental Scorecard.<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Interest Group Ratings"/> In his 2010 campaign, Gerlach received $41,250 from the Energy/Natural Resource sector.<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Campaign Finances">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/finance.php?can_id=5226|title=Project Vote Smart – The Voter's Self Defense System|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 January 2015}}</ref>

The liberal [[Americans for Democratic Action]] rated Gerlach's 2005 voting record at 35 points out of 100; the [[American Conservative Union]] ranked him at 56 points, on the same scale. The American Public Health Association scored Representative Gerlach's support record at 44 percent in 2009.<ref name="Project Vote Smart Gerlach Interest Group Ratings"/>

===Environmental conservation===
In 2013, Gerlach and [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Congressman Mike Thompson]] (D-Calif.) introduced the Conservation Easement Incentive Act. The act would give tax benefits to property owners who preserve their land for conservation.<ref>Julie Harrison, [http://riponadvance.com/news/house-seeks-tax-incentive-for-land-conservation-donations/4612 "House seeks tax incentive for land conservation donations"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927213507/http://riponadvance.com/news/house-seeks-tax-incentive-for-land-conservation-donations/4612 |date=2013-09-27 }}, ''The Ripon Advance'', 09-04-2013. (Retrieved 09-04-2013)</ref>

===Post-Congress work===
In 2015, Gerlach was announced as the new president and chief executive officer of [[BIPAC]], the Business-Industry Political Action Committee.  Prior to joining BIPAC and since leaving Congress, Gerlach had been working at [[Venable LLP]].<ref>Megan R.

In 2002, he defeated [[Dan Wofford]], son of former U.S. Senator [[Harris Wofford]], by 51.4 percent to 48.6 percent.<ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2002/pages/states/PA/index.html Election 2002 — State Races: Pennsylvania], CNN.com. Retrieved October 18, 2005.</ref>

===2004===
In 2004, Gerlach won a close re-election against Democrat [[Lois Murphy]], by 51.0 percent to 49.0 percent.

===2006===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#6th Congressional district}}
In their rematch in 2006, Gerlach again beat Murphy by an even narrower margin of 50.6 percent to 49.4 percent (unofficial results as of November 8, 2006). Gerlach was the only member of the "Philly Trio" of vulnerable Republican Congressmen (the others being [[Curt Weldon]] and [[Mike Fitzpatrick]]) to survive the 2006 election. He overcame a negative political climate that included the then-unpopular war in Iraq, an unpopular president and a well-liked Democratic governor. Geography also played a factor; similar to the previous two cycles Gerlach carried [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], [[Berks County]], and [[Lehigh County]] by significant margins,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dsf.chesco.org/election/lib/election/results/cumf.htm|title=Chester County, PA – Official Website|work=chesco.org|accessdate=18 January 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901132119/http://dsf.chesco.org/election/lib/election/results/cumf.htm|archivedate=1 September 2012|df=}}</ref> while Murphy carried the heavily Democratic [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]] portion of the district.<ref>Dave Davies, [http://www.philly.com/mld/dailynews/news/local/15966912.htm For Gerlach, Murphy, geography was destiny], Daily News; November 9, 2006</ref>

In the 2008 election, Gerlach defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Bob Roggio]] to win a fourth term.

In all three contests, Gerlach survived by swamping his Democratic opponents in [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester County]], where he resides.

===2010===
{{See also|Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2010|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 6}}
In February 2009, Gerlach formed a committee to explore a run for [[Governor of Pennsylvania]] in the 2010 election.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/wires/ap/news/state/pennsylvania/20090714_ap_4termusrepgerlachtorunforpagovernor.html]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pottsmerc.com/articles/2009/02/06/news/srv0000004646303.txt |title=Gerlach explores run for governor – The Mercury News: Pottstown, PA and The Tri County areas of Montgomery, Berks and Chester Counties |publisher=pottsmerc.com |date=2009-02-06 |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120427125121/http://www.pottsmerc.com/articles/2009/02/06/news/srv0000004646303.txt |archivedate=2012-04-27 |df= }}</ref><ref>[http://www.gerlachforpa.com/ Gerlach for PA website]</ref> Gerlach ended his campaign for governor on January 7, 2010.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/news/homepage/80978917.html http://www.philly.com/philly/news]</ref>

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 6}}
Gerlach was again challenged by Democratic nominee [[Manan Trivedi]]. Once again, he prevailed over Trivedi at 57 to 43%. He got a substantial assist from the post-census redistricting. The 6th was pushed to the west, extending a tendril across Berks County to grab much of heavily Republican [[Lebanon County, Pennsylvania|Lebanon County]]. While [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 6th with 58 percent of the vote in 2008,<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20151016181827/http://www.swingstateproject.com/diary/4161/ Database of 2008 presidential election results] from Swing State Project</ref> Obama would have only won the new 6th with 53 percent.
