On the topic of [[Scientific opinion on climate change|man-made climate change]], Chabot said "the evidence concerning man-made climate change is far from conclusive".<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cincinnati.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/11/climate-can-debate-forever/17137787/|title=Climate change: 'We can debate this forever'|work=Cincinnati.com|access-date=2018-01-26|language=en}}</ref> Chabot said [[Emissions trading|cap-and-trade]] was an "extreme proposal" that would harm the economy.<ref name=":0" />

The group [[Republicans for Environmental Protection]] issued Chabot an "environmental harm demerit" in 2006 for sponsoring H.R. 4772, a bill that allows land use disputes to proceed immediately to federal court; according to the organization, the bill "would have undermined local control over local planning and zoning matters, a central principle of America's federal system".<ref>[http://www.rep.org/2006_scorecard.pdf Republicans for Environmental Protection 2006 Scorecard] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070615183627/http://www.rep.org/2006_scorecard.pdf |date=2007-06-15 }}</ref> In the same year, the group praised Chabot for offering legislation "prohibiting the [[National Forest Service|Forest Service]] from spending taxpayer dollars to build new [[logging road]]s for private interests in the [[Tongass National Forest]].
