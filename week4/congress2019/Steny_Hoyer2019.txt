==Early political career==
For four years, from 1962 to 1966, Hoyer was a member of the staff of United States Senator [[Daniel Brewster]] (D-[[Maryland]]); also on Senator Brewster's staff at that time was [[Nancy Pelosi]], who would later become a leadership colleague of Hoyer as she served as Minority Leader and Speaker of the House.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/15/AR2006111501521.html|title=Pelosi Splits Democrats With Push For Murtha|author=Jonathan Weisman and Lois Romano|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=November 16, 2006|accessdate=2006-11-16}}</ref>

===Elections===
Fifth District Congresswoman [[Gladys Spellman]] fell into a [[coma]] three days before the 1980 election. She was reelected, but it soon became apparent that she would never regain consciousness, and Congress declared her seat vacant by resolution in February 1981. Hoyer narrowly won a crowded seven-way Democratic [[primary election|primary]], beating Spellman's husband Reuben by only 1,600 votes. He then defeated a better funded [[U.S. Republican Party|Republican]], Audrey Scott, in the May 19 [[special election]] by 56%-44%, earning himself the nickname of "boy wonder".<ref name="washingtonpost.com">Shailagh Murray [https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/16/AR2006111601524.html "Political Pragmatism Carried Hoyer to the Top"].

The day after the 2010 midterm elections in which the Democrats lost control of the House, Hoyer had a private conversation with Pelosi and stated that he would not challenge her bid for Minority Leader (for Pelosi to remain Democratic House Leader).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Murphy|first1=Patricia|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/11/03/nancy-pelosi-has-no-regrets-following-midterm-rout/|title=Nancy Pelosi Has 'No Regrets' Following Midterm Rout|department=The Capitolist|work=[[Politics Daily]]|date=3 November 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104233827/http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/11/03/nancy-pelosi-has-no-regrets-following-midterm-rout/|archivedate=4 November 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> He ran for minority whip, but was challenged by outgoing Majority Whip [[Jim Clyburn]] (the top House Democrats want to remain in the leadership, but the minority party in the House has one less position). Hoyer is moderate while Pelosi and Clyburn are more liberal, and a significant number of Hoyer's would-be supporters in the House who were moderate and conservative Democrats had been defeated for re-election.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2010/11/steny-hoyer-james-clyburn-democratic-leadership-/1 | work=USA Today | first=Catalina | last=Camia | title=Democrats Hoyer, Clyburn fight for leadership post | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/postpartisan/2010/11/hire_hoyer.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Hire Hoyer}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/11/08/hoyer-clyburn-an-impromptu-leadership-fight/ | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Patrick | last=O'Connor | title=Hoyer, Clyburn: An Impromptu Leadership Fight | date=November 8, 2010}}</ref> The [[Congressional Black Caucus]] backed Clyburn, while 30 House Democrats have supported Hoyer, and Hoyer has also raised money and campaigned for many candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/11/high-profile-dems-back-hoyer-in-whip-race.php|title=High Profile Dems Back Hoyer In Whip Race|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/darcy-burner/the-progressive-case-for_b_779979.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Darcy | last=Burner | title=The Progressive Case for Steny Hoyer as Minority Whip | date=May 25, 2011}}</ref> Hoyer received further support from outgoing Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman [[Howard L.

Hoyer and the DCCC have been criticized for picking their preferred candidates through an undemocratic process. In 2018, it was reported that Hoyer sought to alter the outcome of the primary race in [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]]. Hoyer was recorded urging progressive candidate [[Levi Tillemann]] to drop out of the race. Hoyer acknowledged that the DCCC had already identified its choice candidate and discouraged a candid discussion about his weaknesses.<ref name=intercept>{{cite news |last=Fang |first=Lee |date=April 26, 2018 |title=SECRETLY TAPED AUDIO REVEALS DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP PRESSURING PROGRESSIVE TO LEAVE RACE |url=https://theintercept.com/2018/04/26/steny-hoyer-audio-levi-tillemann/?link_id=1&can_id=1ba27d10330c5ba97dcdb8dc6623001a&source=email-secret-audio-of-steny-hoyer&email_referrer=email_343049&email_subject=secret-audio-of-steny-hoyer |work=The Intercept |access-date=April 26, 2018 }}</ref>
