;2012
On February 29, 2012, an Associated Press story mentioned that Pingree was starting to circulate petitions to run for [[United States Senate election in Maine, 2012|the U.S. Senate seat]] vacated by the retirement of [[Olympia Snowe]], which she confirmed on ''[[The Rachel Maddow Show (TV series)|The Rachel Maddow Show]]'' later that night.<ref>{{cite news|title=Sen.

===Tenure===
Soon after her election, she joined the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], of which she is now vice-chairwoman. In September 2010, a video surfaced on the internet showing Pingree at [[Portland International Jetport]] disembarking from a private jet owned by her then-fiancé, hedge fund manager [[Donald Sussman|S.

==Political positions==
On her campaign website, Pingree lists as key elements of her economic strategy supporting small business in Maine, holding banks and credit cards accountable for consumer protection, increasing Maine manufacturing jobs and preventing the overseas outsourcing of these jobs.<ref name="Chellie Pingree On The Record">[http://chelliepingree.com/pages/issues Issues] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101221060028/http://chelliepingree.com/pages/issues |date=2010-12-21 }} "Pingree's campaign website" Accessed 2011-11-20</ref> Pingree's goals additionally include working towards health care reform, increasing women's rights and equality in the workplace, acquiring more sources of clean energy, and ending the war in Afghanistan.<ref name="Chellie Pingree On The Record"/>

===Interest group ratings===
Pingree consistently receives high approval ratings from labor, pro-choice, and environmental interest groups.<ref name="votesmart.org">[http://www.votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/6586/chellie-pingree Chellie Pingree: Interest Group Rating]. Project Vote Smart.

In 2010 the American political magazine ''[[National Journal]]'' gave Pingree a Composite Conservative rating of 9%, and a Composite Liberal rating of 92%.<ref name="votesmart.org"/>

===Trade===
Pingree is opposed to granting the President [[Fast track (trade)|fast track authority]] in negotiating trade agreements, having voted against doing so on June 12, 2015.

===Other issues===
Pingree helped draft the Fair Elections Now Act, a proposal to provide public 'Fair Elections' funding for popular candidates who raised a sufficient number of small local contributions.<ref name = "Congress needs Fair Elections Now">{{cite news|last=Pingree|first=Chellie|title=Congress needs Fair Elections Now|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/168687-congress-needs-fair-elections-now|newspaper=The Hill|date=June 27, 2011}}</ref> Pingree has spoken out against the 2011 Supreme Court ruling [[McComish v.

Pingree has consistently voted against resolutions promoting aggressive foreign policy.<ref name="ReferenceA">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/6586/chellie-pingree |title=Chellie Pingree: Key Votes |publisher=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=March 8, 2012}}</ref> Pingree voted "yea" in March 2011 on a resolution to remove forces from [[Afghanistan]].

In 2017 Pingree did not attend the inauguration of Donald Trump  and instead visited a Planned Parenthood center and a business owned by immigrants.  She attended the [[Women's March on Washington]] the following day and stood on stage with other politicians who had also refused to attend the inauguration. “We need to do everything we can to let the incoming administration know we are not happy about their agenda. I’ve had unprecedented numbers of my constituents calling me worried about healthcare, the environment, public education, and they feel disrespected,” she said.<ref name="The Guardian2">{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2017/jan/20/womens-march-washington-donald-trump-protest|title=Women's March organizers prepare for hundreds of thousands of protesters|newspaper=The Guardian|last=Walters|first=Joanna|date=January 20, 2017|accessdate=January 23, 2017}}</ref>
