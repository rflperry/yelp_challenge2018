Describing her political positions, the ''[[The Washington Post|Washington Post]]'' wrote that "Capito has been something of a wildcard in Congress, befitting the mixed blue and red political strains of her home state.

She does not believe that ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' should be overturned, but has voted to ban abortions after 20 weeks and has cast other [[Anti-abortion movements|antiabortion]] votes. Capito has also been a stalwart supporter of the coal industry, introducing mining safety measures and campaigning against the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2014/11/04/who-is-shelley-moore-capito/|title=Who is Shelley Moore Capito?|website=Washington Post|language=en|access-date=2018-09-10}}</ref>
