==Early life, education and career==
[[File:Official Christmas Matheson.jpg|left|thumb|Matheson and his family]]
Matheson was born in [[Salt Lake City]], Utah, and obtained an [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Harvard College]] and his [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] from the [[UCLA Anderson School of Management]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/matheson/bio.shtml |title=Congressman Jim Matheson – Biography |accessdate=November 9, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061104195755/http://www.house.gov/matheson/bio.shtml |archivedate=November 4, 2006 |df= }}</ref> His father, [[Scott M.

Prior to entering politics, Matheson worked in the energy field, working for several different companies and studying environmental policy. He later started his own energy consulting firm.

His wife, Amy, is a pediatrician and they have two sons, William and Harris.<ref name="JM Bio">{{cite web|title=Town hall info |url=http://townhall.com/election-2012/election-2010//state/ut/candidate/james-jim-david-matheson/ |work=Town hall |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120125224359/http://townhall.com/election-2012/election-2010//state/ut/candidate/james-jim-david-matheson/ |archivedate=January 25, 2012 }}</ref>

He joined a group that was in favor of increased compensation for people who were affected by the radiation from Cold War atomic testing. The radioactive fallout from nuclear tests caused the [[cancer]] that killed Matheson's father.<ref name="NJ bio">{{cite web |title= NJ bio |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/jim-matheson-ut/ |work= National Journal}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Matheson was co-chairman of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]],<ref>{{cite news |author=Bob Bernick Jr. |title=Frugal Matheson walks to own beat |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,650202661,00.html |work=Deseret Morning News |date=October 29, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2006 }}</ref> a conservative group of 25 Democrats in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]]. He was also a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]]. During his congressional tenure, he was the only Democrat in Utah's Congressional Delegation.

During his time in Congress, Matheson was relatively conservative by national party standards.<ref name="far enough to the right">{{cite news |author=Bob Bernick Jr. |title=Matheson far enough to the right for Utahns |url=http://deseretnews.com/dn/view/0,1249,645195985,00.html |work=Deseret Morning News |date=August 31, 2006 |accessdate=November 9, 2006 }}</ref> In the ''National Journal'' ratings in 2010, Matheson was more conservative than 51% of his colleagues, but more liberal than 49%, making him one of the most conservative Democrats, yet a centrist overall. On November 3{{clarify|date=December 2011}}, Matheson voted against requiring public disclosure of bonuses and golden parachute arrangements (agreements between a company and an employee specifying that the employee will receive significant benefits if they are terminated). This was a bill that the Democrats heavily supported and the Republicans opposed; only five other Democrats voted against the bill.

=== Foreign policy and terrorism ===
In March 2007, Matheson was one of 14 Democrats who voted against a bill that would require President [[George W. Bush]] to bring combat troops home from [[Iraq]] by September 1, 2008.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Matheson regularly voted in favor of the wars in the Middle East, having voted for the 2003 Iraq invasion and opposing the bill to remove troops from Libya in 2011 and Pakistan in 2010. He did, however, vote in favor of requiring a time-table for withdrawal from Afghanistan, after opposing the bill in two previous votes.

In 2011, Matheson voted to extend expiring provisions of the [[PATRIOT Act]]<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll036.xml</ref> and voted in favor of the [[National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2012]].<ref>{{cite web|title=HR 1540 National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 – Voting Record|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bill/votes/37467|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

=== Abortion ===
Matheson leans [[pro-life]] but supports expanding federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]]. He was rated 55% from [[National Right to Life Committee]] indicating a mixed record on abortion and 30% from [[NARAL]] indicating a pro-life voting record.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} However, Matheson's NARAL Pro-Choice America rating dropped to 0% in 2010, while he garnered a 50% rating from the National Right to Life Committee.<ref>{{cite web

=== Debt and economy ===
Matheson voted against raising the federal debt limit, as well as against both Republican and Democratic budgets that did not reduce the deficit.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}} Matheson, a former energy industry businessman, voted against authorizing the construction of new oil refineries.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Matheson was a strong supporter of Wall Street regulation, voting in favor of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, the strongest set of Wall Street reforms since the 1930s. In a comment on this legislation, Matheson stated, "Nearly two years ago the subprime mortgage meltdown triggered the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. We've been living under the same set of rules that were in place before the financial crisis sparked the job-killing recession. Now, that is about to change."<ref>{{cite web

In July 2011, Matheson was one of five Democrats to vote for the [[Cut, Cap and Balance Act]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Berman|first=Russell|title=Five Blue Dogs join GOP in vote for 'cut, cap and balance' bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/172441-five-blue-dogs-join-gop-in-vote-for-cut-cap-and-balance-bill|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=July 21, 2011|date=July 19, 2011}}</ref>

In January 2013, Matheson was one of sixteen Democrats that voted against the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h659 |title=H.R. 8: American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012 (On the Senate Amendment)}}</ref> which was the last minute solution to the U.S. [[fiscal cliff]].  Matheson released a statement saying that "to address the fiscal cliff,  legislation must include a strong framework for real deficit reduction.  Sadly, this bill falls short."<ref>{{citation|title=Matheson statement on vote on 'fiscal cliff' measure|url=http://matheson.house.gov/news-releases/matheson-statement-on-vote-on-fiscal-cliff-measure/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130104184658/http://matheson.house.gov/news-releases/matheson-statement-on-vote-on-fiscal-cliff-measure|deadurl=yes|archivedate=January 4, 2013|df=}}</ref>

=== Education ===
Matheson is also opposed to the No Child Left Behind Act, believing that education is a local issue and federal funds should come with minimal strings attached. Matheson also believes that the "Highly Qualified Teacher" requirements should be more flexible, and that states should have alternative options to the single standardized test used in No Child Left Behind.<ref>{{cite web

=== Healthcare ===
In November 2009, during intense debates over [[Health care reform in the United States|American health care reform]], Matheson voted against the [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 398 | date=October 24, 2001 | publisher=[[United States House of Representatives]] | url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll398.xml | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}{{failed verification|date=March 2010}}</ref> When President Obama named Matheson's brother Scott M. Matheson to the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit at a time where he needed Matheson's vote for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' posted an article that said "Barack Obama will host ten House Democrats who voted against the health care bill in November at the White House; he's obviously trying to persuade them to switch their vote to yes. One of the ten is Jim Matheson of Utah."<ref name="Healthcare votes">{{cite web|title=Obama Now Selling Judgeships for Healthcare Votes?|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/obama-now-selling-appeals-court-judgeships-health-care-votes|work=The Weekly Standard}}</ref> They suggested that the White House was using this timely nomination to influence Matheson's vote. Matheson responded by saying that he is very happy for his brother and that "the federal 10th Circuit Court will gain a judge devoted to judicial integrity, fairness and knowledge of the law."<ref name="Political Gain">{{cite web|title=Jim Matheson & the Obama Administration's Record of Using Nominations for Political Gain |url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/keyword/Jim-Matheson|work=The Weekly Standard}}</ref> In March 2010, he was one of 34 Democrats to vote against the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which passed the House 219-212.<ref>{{cite news | title=Health care reform: How House members voted |publisher=CNN | date=March 2010 | url=http://www.cnn.com/interactive/2010/03/politics/health.care.votes.final/index.5.html | accessdate=March 29, 2010}}</ref> However, when the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] reconsidered the legislation in January 2011, Matheson voted against repealing the healthcare overhaul.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/112/house/1/votes/14/?hpid=artslot | title=Repeal health-care overhaul |work=The Washington Post}}</ref>

=== Video games ===
On January 15, 2013 during the 113th Congress Matheson introduced a bill called H.R. 287 or The "Video Games Ratings Enforcement Act" that if passed no video game can be sold on a public market without an official rating from the ESRB. Matheson introduced this bill in light of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]].<ref>http://thehill.com/images/stories/blogs/flooraction/jan2013/hr287.pdf</ref>{{update after|2014|12|31}}<!-- what happened to the bill? -->

===Caucus memberships===
*Congressional Arts Caucus
*Congressional Cement Caucus, Co-Chair

==Political campaigns==

===2000===
In 2000, Matheson was tapped to run for the 2nd district seat. The Democrats were optimistic in part because the 2nd district has historically been friendlier to Democrats than the rest of Utah and in part because two-term incumbent [[Merrill Cook]] had a reputation for erratic behavior.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/opinion/e2173.htm | work=USA Today | title=Smith upsets incumbent Cook | date=June 28, 2000}}</ref> The prospect of losing the seat frightened district Republicans enough that Cook was unseated in the primary by computer executive Derek Smith. However, Matheson defeated Smith comfortably, taking 56 percent of the vote even as George W. Bush won the district with 57% of the vote.

===2002===
During the 2000s round of redistricting, the Republican-controlled state legislature [[gerrymandering|significantly altered]] Matheson's district. The old 2nd had been located entirely in [[Salt Lake County]] since the 1980s round of redistricting; Salt Lake County has historically been friendlier to Democrats (at least at the state and local level) than the rest of Utah. The legislature drew all or part of 14 mostly rural counties in eastern and southern Utah into the 2nd. They were only connected to Salt Lake City by a narrow band of territory in heavily Republican [[Utah County]]. In addition, the legislature shifted most of western Salt Lake City to the 1st, leaving the more conservative eastern part of the city in the 2nd. The new district was approximately six points more Republican than its predecessor. Matheson was thought to face difficult odds for reelection, even though his family has roots in southern Utah.

As expected, the 2002 race was very close. Matheson defeated State Representative [[John Swallow]] by only 1,600 votes, largely due to a 25,800-vote margin over John Swallow in Salt Lake County.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2002/pages/states/UT/H/02/county.000.html |title=Election 2002 – County Results: Utah House 02 |publisher=CNN |accessdate=July 12, 2010}}</ref> According to at least one study, some extra financial help from the Republican Party might have helped Swallow defeat Matheson. However, national Republicans stayed out of the race after state legislators claimed they had drawn a district that no Democrat could possibly win.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://csed.byu.edu/Assets/Pew/2002%20Monograph.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080909235944/http://csed.byu.edu/Assets/Pew/2002%20Monograph.pdf |archivedate=September 9, 2008 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>

===2004===
Matheson defeated Swallow again—this time by a 12-point margin even as Bush won the state by a large margin (and carried the district with 67 percent of the vote).

===2006===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Utah, 2006#Second District}}
Matheson defeated State Representative [[LaVar Christensen]] by 22 points.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Utah, 2008#District 2}}
Matheson defeated Republican challenger Bill Dew in the 2008 general election by 28 percent.

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Utah, 2010#District 2}}
Matheson won against Republican nominee [[Morgan Philpot]]. In May, Matheson faced his first challenge from within his party. Claudia Wright claimed that Jim Matheson was not liberal enough and obtained 45% of the vote at the Democratic State Convention, forcing a primary for the Democratic nomination. After weeks of campaigning Matheson secured the Democratic nomination, by obtaining 67.5% of the vote.

===2012===
Matheson had said he was considering a run for statewide office in 2012, particularly if his seat was substantially changed in redistricting.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lisa Riley Roche |title=Two Utah Political Heavyweights Eyeing Key Races |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705374250/Two-Utah-political-heavyweights-eyeing-key-races.html |work=Deseret News |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 }}</ref> Polling conducted in July 2011 showed Matheson leading incumbent Republican Senator [[Orrin Hatch]] in a possible 2012 Senate race.<ref>{{cite news |author=Lisa Riley Roche |title=Poll: Time for Senator Hatch To Go |url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/700145325/Poll-Time-for-Senator-Orrin-Hatch-to-go.html |work=Deseret News |date=June 18, 2011 |accessdate=June 27, 2011 }}</ref>

On December 15, 2011, Matheson announced that he would run for the newly created seat in the [[Utah's 4th congressional district|4th congressional district]], meaning there would be an open-seat race for the 2nd district. The 2nd district race was not expected to be competitive for Democrats. In a three-way race between Matheson, [[Mia Love]] (Republican) and Jim Vein (Libertarian), Matheson beat Love by 768 votes. In the race, Vein garnered 6,439 votes.<ref name="New district">{{cite web|title=
