==Political background==
Byrne's first run for elective office was in 1994 was a success when he ran for the [[Alabama State Board of Education]] as a Democrat.<ref name=byrne1>{{cite news | first = | last = | authorlink = | author =Charles J.

He later voted with the Board to support a compromise that said, "Explanations of the origin of life and major groups of plants and animals, including humans, shall be treated as theory and not as fact. When attempting to apply scientific knowledge to world problems, no social agenda shall be promoted." <ref name="Charles J. Dean 1A">{{cite news |author=Charles J. Dean|work=Birmingham News| publisher=Birmingham News| title=Science Curriculum Gets Board Approval |page=1A |date =March 10, 1995}}</ref> In 1996 Byrne voted with the majority of Board members to reject $18 million in federal education funds because it was feared the money would allow greater federal control of schools. The vote was seen as a nod to the growing conservative influence in his south Alabama district.<ref name="Charles J. Dean 1A"/> However Byrne later changed his mind and convinced the Board to allow the money.<ref>{{cite news |author=Tom Gordon|work=Birmingham News| publisher=Birmingham News| title=Education Board's Byrne Will Join GOP Today |page=1B |date =January 9, 1997}}</ref>

In 1997 Byrne left the  [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] party and became a Republican.<ref>{{cite news |author=Tom Gordon|work=Birmingham News| publisher=Birmingham News| title=Win Every Office in State Party Chairman Tells GOP |page=22A |date =January 12, 1997}}</ref>

In 2002 Byrne ran for an Alabama State Senate seat, representing part of [[Baldwin County, Alabama|Baldwin County]].<ref>{{cite news |author=Gary Mitchell|work=Birmingham News| publisher=Birmingham News| title=SBOE's Byrne enters GOP Race for Lipscomb's Seat |page=State and Regional |date =January 16, 2002}}</ref> He won with 91% of the vote over his Democratic challenger.<ref>{{cite news |author=|work=Birmingham News| publisher=Birmingham News| title=Alabama Senate Results |page=News |date =November 7, 2002}}</ref>

==Efforts against corruption==
In May 2007, Byrne took the position of community college chancellor <ref name=chanc>{{cite news |title=Byrne takes over |work=Mobile Register|location=Mobile, Alabama |page=B1 |author=George Altman|date=May 25, 2007|type=newspaper}}</ref> and oversaw a controversial reordering of much of the system. [[Bishop State Community College]] in Mobile was the target of investigators who found both financial and academic issues at the school in 2006 and 2007. Byrne ordered an audit of the school which demonstrated many deficiencies. At the time, about 2 dozen people were charged with criminal fraud and theft charges. A total of 27 would be charged before the probe ended in May 2007 <ref name=chanc/><ref>{{cite news | first = | last = | authorlink = | author =George R.

==2010 gubernatorial campaign==
{{main|Alabama gubernatorial election, 2010}}

During the campaign, he was accused by his opponents in the Republican primary of supporting [[evolution]] and of doubting that the Bible was [[biblical infallibility|infallible]].  "As a Christian and as a public servant, I have never wavered in my belief that this world and everything in it is a masterpiece created by the hands of God ... As a member of the Alabama Board of Education, the record clearly shows that I fought to ensure the teaching of [[creationism]] in our school text books. Those who attack me have distorted, twisted and misrepresented my comments and are spewing utter lies to the people of this state."  He also added that he believed "every single word" of the Bible was true.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20004740-503544.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=Alabama Gov.

===Possible Supreme Court run===
A May 25, 2011 ''Mobile Press-Register'' article reported that Byrne was considering the possibility of running for [[chief justice]] of the [[Alabama Supreme Court]] in the upcoming 2012 election. "I’ve been encouraged to look at it, and I’m doing that. But I’ve made no decision, and frankly I’m no where near a decision at this point," Byrne said.<ref>{{cite news |first= |last= |title=Alabama Supreme Court race has lawyers buzzing |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2011/05/alabama_supreme_court_race_has.html |newspaper=[[Mobile Press-Register]] |location=[[Mobile, AL]] |date=May 25, 2011 |access-date= }}</ref> He ultimately did not enter the race.

Byrne finished first in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district—and faced Tea Party candidate Dean Young in the runoff election.
