After Congressman [[Pete Geren]] announced he would retire in 1996, both the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] and Republican parties worked to recruit Granger to run for his seat. Republicans were bullish on their chances of winning [[Texas' 12th congressional district]]. It had once been represented by Democratic [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] [[Jim Wright]], but legislative redistricting after the 1990 census had added areas with more Republican residents.
