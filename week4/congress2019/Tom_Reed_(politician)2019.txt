New York lost two seats in the U.S. House due to redistricting. The 29th Congressional District was eliminated and much of the district became the 23rd Congressional District.

After his reelection to Congress, Reed drafted the Promoting Assistance with Transitional Help Act. The bill would modify the Temporary Assistance for Needy Family (TANF) program by introducing a five-year limit on [[welfare]] payments to individuals. The TANF program was originally intended to provide temporary assistance to needy families but had deviated from that mandate and in some states provided indefinite cash benefits to individuals. Reed hopes that requiring the program to provide only temporary emergency relief will reduce dependence on government assistance.<ref>"[http://riponadvance.com/news/reed-to-introduce-bill-to-support-welfare-recipients/4469 Reed to introduce bill to support welfare recipients]", ''The Ripon Advance'', 08-26-2013; retrieved 09-03-2013.</ref>

The legislation would ensure that [[armed services]] members were paid and that seniors continued receiving benefits during a temporary government shutdown. The bill also forfeited pay for Congress and the President for the duration of the government shutdown.<ref>{{cite news|last=Harrison |first=Julie |title=Reed introduces the Pay Our Veterans and Seniors First Act |url=http://riponadvance.com/news/reed-introduces-the-pay-our-veterans-and-seniors-first-act/4851 |accessdate=30 September 2013 |newspaper=The Ripon Advance |date=September 25, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202230941/http://riponadvance.com/news/reed-introduces-the-pay-our-veterans-and-seniors-first-act/4851 |archivedate= 2 December 2013 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=REP.

In 2014, Reed introduced the Clinical Trial Cancer Mission 2020 Act. The bill would make it mandatory for researchers to publish all information from cancer clinical trials, with the goal being to get more researchers to work together and bring down the number of duplicative studies. The legislation would create a national clearinghouse run by the NIH.<ref>[http://riponadvance.com/news/bill-aims-enhance-cancer-research-end-cancer-2020/6620 “Bill aims to enhance cancer research, end cancer by 2020”].

On May 22, 2014, Reed introduced the [[Fighting Hunger Incentive Act of 2014 (H.R. 4719; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]] to permanently extend and expand certain expired provisions that provided an enhanced tax deduction for businesses that donated their food [[inventory]] to [[charitable organizations]].<ref name=4719sum>{{cite web|title=H.R.4719 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4719|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref><ref name=4719cbo>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 4719 |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45425|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Reed argued that it makes sense to make this a permanent measure because "doing it on a temporary basis... is part of the problem. We need to make this sound policy permanent in the tax code and I'm optimistic we'll get it to the finish and allow people to take advantage of the tax deduction that would encourage them to use the food rather than put it in a landfill."<ref name=WENYreed>{{cite news|last1=Meyer|first1=Kellie|title=Reed Fighting Hunger Incentive Act |url=http://www.weny.com/news/local-news/reed-fighting-hunger-incentive-act052714|accessdate=July 16, 2014|publisher=WENY|date=May 27, 2014}}</ref>

Reed was ranked as the 32nd most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the [[114th United States Congress]] (and the seventh most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from New York) in the Bipartisan Index created by [[Richard Lugar#The Lugar Center|The Lugar Center]] and the [[McCourt School of Public Policy]] that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.thelugarcenter.org/assets/htmldocuments/The%20Lugar%20Center%20-%20McCourt%20School%20Bipartisan%20Index%20114th%20Congress%20House%20Scores.pdf|title=The Lugar Center - McCourt School Bipartisan Index|publisher=[[Richard Lugar#The Lugar Center|The Lugar Center]]|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

Reed, who sits on the House tax-writing Way and Means Committee, was one of only two House members from New York state (along with [[Chris Collins (U.S. politician)|Chris Collins]]) to support the provision in Republican tax overhaul bill introduced November 2, 2017 eliminating personal deductions for state income taxes on federal tax forms.   In response New York Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] labeled the two lawmakers "the Benedict Arnolds of their time", claiming that the loss of the deduction would cost New York State taxpayers nearly $15 billion and do grave damage to the state.<ref>Jerry Zremski [http://buffalonews.com/2017/10/31/reed-collins-revel-in-tax-compromise-that-cuomo-schumer-abhor/ “Reed and Collins revel in tax compromise that Cuomo and Schumer abhor”], ''Buffalo News'', November 1, 2017, Retrieved November 4, 2017</ref>

In December 2017, Reed voted in favor of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act]].<ref>https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/115-2017/s303</ref>

In the wake of Collins's arrest for [[insider trading]] violations in August 2018, Reed introduced a proposed change to House rules that would prohibit members of the House of Representatives from serving on the boards of directors of publicly held companies. Reed proposed the change in partnership with Democratic Representative [[Kathleen Rice]].<ref>https://twitter.com/RepTomReed/status/1027669549552951296</ref>
