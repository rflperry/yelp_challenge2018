==Early life, education, and career==
{{more citations needed|section|date=June 2017}}
Lipinski was born in Chicago, and is the son of Rose Marie (née Lapinski)<!--- SIC ---> and former U.S. Congressman [[Bill Lipinski]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1079|title=Our Campaigns – Candidate – William O. Lipinski|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref> He holds a Bachelor of Science degree from [[Northwestern University]] in mechanical engineering (earned in 1988), a Master of Science degree from [[Stanford University]] (1989) in engineering-economic systems, and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[political science]] from [[Duke University]] (1998).
<ref>{{cite web|title=Daniel Lipinski's Biography|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/33692/daniel-lipinski#.VIc93THF-Tt|website=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=December 9, 2014}}</ref>

During the summer of 1992, he interned at the [[United States Department of Labor]]. He served in that same capacity for U.S. Congressman [[George E. Sangmeister]] from 1993 to 1995. From 1995 to 1996, Lipinski was a legislative staff member for U.S. Congressman [[Jerry Costello]]. He then served on Cook County State's Attorney [[Richard A. Devine]]'s campaign during the 1996 election season, and later on Devine's transition staff. After a short stint on then-U.S. Congressman [[Rod Blagojevich]]'s staff, Lipinski served as a communication staff aide to then-House Minority Leader [[Richard Gephardt]].

From 2000 to 2001, Lipinski taught at the [[University of Notre Dame]]. In 2001, he joined the faculty of the [[University of Tennessee]], where he remained until his election to Congress in 2004.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 2004, Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward—which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd—he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; not only had the younger Lipinski not lived regularly in Illinois since 1989 and never run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/IL.phtml|title=The Green Papers: Illinois 2004 General Election|accessdate=January 17, 2008}}</ref><ref name=":2">{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/campaign/580-accidental-congressman-lipinski-draws-another-primary-challenge|title=‘Accidental congressman’ Lipinski draws another primary challenge|last=Blake|first=Aaron|date=2007-06-14|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-02-25|language=en}}</ref> As expected, Lipinski defeated his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the general election.

In the 2006 Democratic primary Lipinski won 55% of the vote against two opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski faced Republican Michael Bendas, and once again won with over 70% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/race_detail/district-2010-IL-03.html?cqp=1|title=Race Detail Display Page : Roll Call|work=rollcall.com|accessdate=January 22, 2015}}</ref>
