'''Thomas Jeffery Cole''' (born April 28, 1949) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OK|4}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is a Deputy [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|Majority Whip]]. The chairman of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] (NRCC) from 2006 to 2008, he was, during his tenure, the fourth-ranking [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] leader in the House. As of 2015, Cole – a member of the [[Chickasaw Nation]] – is one of only two registered [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] in Congress (the other being fellow Oklahoman [[Markwayne Mullin]]).

==Early life, education, and educating career==
Cole was born in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]], the son of Helen Te Ata (née Gale) and John D. Cole.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cole.htm |title=cole |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2015-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313025034/http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cole.htm |archivedate=2016-03-13 |df= }}</ref> He is a fifth-generation Oklahoman, having been raised in [[Moore, Oklahoma]]. He graduated from [[Grinnell College]] in 1971 with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[history]]. His postgraduate degrees include an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] from [[Yale University]] (1974) and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Oklahoma]] (1984), both in [[British history]]. Cole's Ph.D. thesis was entitled ''[http://www.geoffrobinson.info/?p=147 Life and Labor in the Isle of Dogs: The Origins and Evolution of an East London Working-Class Community, 1800–1980]''. Cole did research abroad as a [[Thomas J. Watson Fellow]] and was a [[Fulbright Fellow]] (1977–78) at the [[University of London]]. He was a college professor in history and politics before becoming a politician.

==Early political career==
Following his mother [[Helen TeAta Gale Cole|Helen]], who served as a state representative and senator, Cole served in the [[Oklahoma Senate]] from 1988 to 1991, resigning mid-term to become Executive Director of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. From 1995 to 1999, he was Oklahoma's [[Secretary of State of Oklahoma|Secretary of State]] under Governor [[Frank Keating]], and assisted with the recovery efforts following the 1995 [[Oklahoma City bombing]]. He resigned to become chief of staff to the [[Republican National Committee]].<ref>[http://newsok.com/article/2644851 Official Lands GOP Post Keating to Name New Secretary of State]</ref><ref>[http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1999/03/02/rnc.chief RNC picks new chief of staff]</ref> He also served as Chairman of the [[Oklahoma Republican Party]] for much of the 1980s.

Cole has been heavily involved in national politics as well, having served both as Executive Director of the NRCC and as Chief of Staff of the [[Republican National Committee]] (RNC).

Cole spent two years working as a paid consultant for the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]], but his primary involvement in politics was as a [[political consultant]] for candidates. Along with partners Sharon Hargrave Caldwell and Deby Snodgrass, his firm (Cole, Hargrave, Snodgrass and Associates) played a large part in the reconstruction of Oklahoma's political landscape, and backed a number of candidates that took office during the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994. Among their clients have been Keating, [[J.C. Watts]], [[Tom Coburn]], [[Frank Lucas (Oklahoma politician)|Frank Lucas]], [[Mary Fallin]], [[Wes Watkins]], [[Steve Largent]], former Mississippi congressman [[Chip Pickering]], and Hawaii governor [[Linda Lingle]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
During his initial campaign for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 2002, Cole received the endorsement of Watts, the popular outgoing congressman. This helped him win a hard-fought general election over Democratic nominee and former Oklahoma State Senator Darryl Roberts. Cole subsequently won easy re-election campaigns in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014 and 2016.

===Tenure===
Following the 2006 election cycle, the members of the House Republican Conference elected Cole to the post of NRCC Chairman, placing him in charge of national efforts to assist Republican candidates for Congress.

His voting record during his nine years in the House marks Cole as a solid conservative with occasional libertarian sympathies. He has consistently voted anti-abortion and pro-business positions, and established himself as a supporter of free trade, gun rights, the military, veterans, and American Indian issues. He favors loosening immigration restrictions and imposing stricter limits on campaign funds.  In 2012, he sponsored H.R. 5912 which would prohibit public funds from being used for political party conventions.  This legislation passed the House in September but awaits action by the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr5912 |title=H.R. 5912: To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to prohibit the use of public funds for political party conventions |accessdate=12 October 2012}}</ref>

Cole has consistently voted against positions supported by lobbies for senior citizens, labor unions, and teachers' unions. However, he was critical in brokering protections for [[United States Department of Defense|DOD]] civilian workers.[https://web.archive.org/web/20060811051620/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/c001053/]

In June 2013, after another failure of the [[United States farm bill]] in Congress, Cole called the failure of the legislation inexcusable. His district in [[Oklahoma]] includes some of the state's [[Agriculture|farming]] communities, and if the Farm Bill passed, it would have saved $40 billion over a ten-year period.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://newsok.com/oklahoma-reps.-tom-cole-jim-bridenstine-disagree-on-farm-bill/article/3854974 |title=Oklahoma Reps. Tom Cole, Jim Bridenstine Disagree on Farm Bill |last1=Casteel |first1=Chris |date=June 21, 2013 |publisher=NewsOK |accessdate=20 July 2013}}</ref>

As Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch, Cole was responsible for introducing the [[Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4487; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4487allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4487 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4487/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $3.3 billion to the legislative branch for FY 2015, which is approximately the same amount it received in FY 2014.<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> According to  Cole, the bill meets its goals "in both an effective and efficient manner, and has done so in a genuinely bipartisan, inclusive and deliberative fashion."<ref name=RCHess2Ap>{{cite news|last=Hess|first=Hannah|title=Legislative Branch Bill Keeps House Spending in Check|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/legislative_branch_bill_keeps_house_spending_in_check-231875-1.html|accessdate=14 May 2014|newspaper=Roll Call|date=2 April 2014}}</ref>

In 2013, Cole introduced the Home School Equity Act for Tax Relief. The bill would allow some [[Homeschooling|homeschool]] parents to take [[tax credits]] for purchasing classroom materials.<ref>Jim East, [http://riponadvance.com/news/legislation-would-give-home-school-families-access-to-education-tax-deduction/ "Legislation would give home school families access to education tax deduction"] {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130828221405/http://riponadvance.com/news/legislation-would-give-home-school-families-access-to-education-tax-deduction/ |date=2013-08-28 }}, ''The Ripon Advance'', August 28, 2013. (Retrieved August 28, 2013)</ref>

Cole expressed his intention in 2018 to push his Tribal Labor Sovereignty Act into the spending bill as an omnibus. The bill would "make clear that the [[National Labor Relations Board]] has no jurisdiction over businesses owned and operated by an Indian tribe and located on tribal land."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Wong|first1=Scott|title=Five things lawmakers want attached to the $1 trillion funding bill|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/377682-five-things-lawmakers-want-attached-to-the-1-trillion-funding-bill|website=The Hill|accessdate=10 March 2018}}</ref>

Cole was ranked as the 91st most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the [[114th United States Congress]] (and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Oklahoma) in the Bipartisan Index created by [[Richard Lugar#The Lugar Center|The Lugar Center]] and the [[McCourt School of Public Policy]] that ranks members of the United States Congress by their degree of bipartisanship (by measuring the frequency each member's bills attract co-sponsors from the opposite party and each member's co-sponsorship of bills by members of the opposite party).<ref>{{Citation|url=http://www.thelugarcenter.org/assets/htmldocuments/The%20Lugar%20Center%20-%20McCourt%20School%20Bipartisan%20Index%20114th%20Congress%20House%20Scores.pdf|title=The Lugar Center - McCourt School Bipartisan Index|publisher=[[Richard Lugar#The Lugar Center|The Lugar Center]]|date=March 7, 2016|accessdate=April 30, 2017}}</ref>

=== 2016 House Speakership election ===
In the contest for House Speaker that followed the resignation of [[John Boehner]] Cole supported the claims of [[Paul Ryan]]:

"Anyone who attacks Paul Ryan as being insufficiently conservative is either woefully misinformed or maliciously destructive...Paul Ryan has played a major role in advancing the conservative cause and creating the Republican House majority. His critics are not true conservatives. They are radical populists who neither understand nor accept the institutions, procedures and traditions that are the basis of constitutional governance."<ref>{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/13/us/politics/latest-unease-on-right-ryan-is-too-far-left.html|title = Latest Unease on Right – Is Ryan Too Far to the Left?|last = Steinhauer|first = Jennifer|date = 12 October 2015|work = New York Times|access-date = 13 October 2015|via = }}</ref>

===Committee membership===
As of the [[115th United States Congress]], Tom Cole is a member of the following U.S. House committees:
* '''[[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Committee on Appropriations]]'''
** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies]] (Chair)

** [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies|Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies]]
* '''[[United States House Committee on the Budget|Committee on the Budget]]'''
* '''[[United States House Committee on Rules]]'''

===Political stances===

Cole supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that "It is fair and appropriate to debate the merits of President Trump's executive order and its initial implementation. But it is inappropriate to engage in demagogic, inflammatory, inaccurate and reckless rhetoric that is designed to create and exploit a political issue rather than address a real threat to our security. I fear that is exactly what we are seeing from many of the President's critics."<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref>
