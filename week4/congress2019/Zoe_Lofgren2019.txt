She is the district's first female U.S. Representative and a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district, numbered as the [[California's 16th congressional district|16th district]] from 1995 to 2013, includes most of [[San Jose, California|San Jose]]. She is the [[ranking member]] on both the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|House Committee on House Administration]] [[United States House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight|Subcommittee on Oversight]], and on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement]].

==Early life, education and private career==
A [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] resident, Lofgren attended [[Gunn High School]] (1966) in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]],<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L-_zoKQ-mvQC&pg=PA26&dq=john+collins+married+lofgren+zoe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YfreU7XlBceYyATpgYKgDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=john%20collins%20married%20lofgren%20zoe&f=false |title=Official Congressional Directory, 2005–2006, 109th Congress, Convened ... |publisher=Congress, Joint Committee on Printing |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the [[Junior State of America]], a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsa.org/wp-content/uploads/JSA-notables.doc|title=Notable Alumni of the Junior State of America|access-date=December 28, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303203612/http://www.jsa.org/wp-content/uploads/JSA-notables.doc|archive-date=March 3, 2016|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> She earned her B.A. degree at [[Stanford University]] (1970) and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree at [[Santa Clara University School of Law]] (1975).<ref name="google1"/>

In 1978 she married John Marshall Collins.<ref name="google2"/>

Returning to San Jose, Lofgren worked in [[Don Edwards]]' district office, while at the same time earning her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree. After two years as partner at an immigration law firm in San Jose, she was elected first to the board of [[San Jose City College]], then to the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[board of supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], where she served for 13 years.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1994, Lofgren entered the Democratic primary in what was then the 16th District, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. It was the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.  A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor [[Tom McEnery]]. Lofgren's victory virtually assured her of becoming only the second person to represent the district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th District from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993, the 16th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013).  She has been reelected ten times with no substantive opposition.

Lofgren is the chair of the 34-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the [[Secure Communities]] deportation program.<ref name="la-now">{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/congresswoman-calls-for-investigation-of-enforcement-program-that-screens-for-illegal-immigrants-in-.html | title=Congresswoman calls for investigation of enforcement program that screens for illegal immigrants in jails | author=Romney, Lee | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]].  In doing so, she presided over a rare [[Censure in the United States|sanction of censure]], against long-time member [[Charles B. Rangel]].<ref name="wapo-full">{{cite news | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120201626.html?hpid=topnews | title=House censures Rep.

In the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill.  She has also opposed the [[data retention]] requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the [[Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011]]).<ref>{{cite news | first = Grant | last = Gross | title = House Panel Votes to Require ISPs to Keep Customer Records | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/236866/house_panel_votes_to_require_isps_to_keep_customer_records.html | work = PC World | accessdate = October 25, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054356/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 25, 2013 |title=Reps.

In May, 2016, Lofgren was publicly reprimanded during a House Judiciary Committee hearing after calling witness [[Gail Heriot]] of the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] an "ignorant bigot" because of the characterization of transgender individuals Heriot included in written testimony prior to the hearing.<ref>[https://judiciary.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/HHRG-114-JU00-Wstate-HeriotG-20160524.pdf Testimony of Gail Heriot to the Task Force on Executive Overreach], May 26, 2016</ref> Following the verbal warning from acting committee chairman [[Steve King]] (R, Iowa), Lofgren responded, "I cannot allow that kind of bigotry to go into the record unchallenged."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/zoe-lofgren-transphobia_us_5746eee4e4b0dacf7ad403eb|title=Congresswoman Shuts Down Transphobic Woman: 'You're A Bigot, Lady'|first=Paige|last=Lavender|date=May 26, 2016|publisher=|via=Huff Post}}</ref>
