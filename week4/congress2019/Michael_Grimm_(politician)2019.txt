He replied that he was "American first" and that "we have become way too polarized," indicating a desire for compromise with Democrats.<ref>FoxNews.com, [http://video.foxnews.com/v/4485122/hannitys-freshmen-focus-group/ Hannity's Freshman Focus Group], January 4, 2011, at 5:30 mark</ref> Grimm did not join the [[Tea Party Caucus]] in the House, instead joining the more moderate [[Republican Main Street Partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Freedlander |first=David |url=http://www.observer.com/2011/politics/ny-tea-partiers-join-moderate-gop-caucus |title=NY Tea Partiers Join 'Moderate' G.O.P.

=====Fiscal issues=====
Grimm was appointed to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|House Financial Services Committee]], which the ''Staten Island Advance'' considered a major opportunity for Grimm to influence the debate on financial reform. Roughly 70,000 of his constituents were involved in financial services, making this a vital issue for his political profile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.silive.com/news/index.ssf/2010/12/staten_islands_grimm_lands_spo.html |title=Staten Island's Grimm lands spot on House Financial Services Committee |publisher=Staten Island Advance |date=December 10, 2010 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

=====Gun control=====
After the 2011 [[2011 Tucson shooting|shooting of Gabrielle Giffords]], Grimm voiced support for "security-based situational awareness training", including how to spot suspicious people, when to run for an exit, and how to keep guards at close range. Grimm also said congressmen should consider carrying firearms. House Leader [[John Boehner]] called his suggestions an "excellent idea" and indicated that security would be a major focus for Congress in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|first=Natalie |last=O'Neill |url=http://www.brooklynpaper.com/stories/34/3/br_grimmsecurity_2011_1_21_bk.html?comm=1 |title=Grimm: House members should pack heat if they want |publisher=The Brooklyn Paper |date=January 14, 2011 |accessdate=April 5, 2012}}</ref>

=====Syria=====
Grimm opposed a military strike on the Assad regime in Syria, stating, "I am no longer convinced that a U.S. strike on Syria will yield a benefit to the United States that will not be greatly outweighed by the extreme cost of war."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Republican congressman withdraws support for Syria strike|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/09/05/republican-congressman-withdraws-support-for-syria-strike/?wprss=rss_politics&clsrd|accessdate=September 2, 2014|publisher=Washington Post|date=September 5, 2013}}</ref>

=====Fundraising allegations by Rabbi Pinto=====
According to a January 27, 2012, ''[[New York Times]] ''article, several followers of Orthodox Rabbi [[Yoshiyahu Yosef Pinto]] said Grimm's campaign had accepted questionable donations. Three of Pinto's followers reportedly said that Grimm or Ofer Biton, a top aide of Pinto's, had told them that the campaign would find a way to accept donations that were over the legal limit. Grimm stated, "Any suggestion that I was involved in any activities that may run afoul of the campaign finance laws is categorically false and belied by my life of public service protecting and enforcing the laws of this country."<ref>{{cite news |last1=Cowan |first1=Alison Leigh |last2=Rashbaum |first2=William K. |title=Rabbi's Followers Cast Doubt on Congressman's Fundraising |date=January 27, 2012 |accessdate=September 18, 2013 |publisher=N.Y.

=====Hurricane Sandy aid=====
In June 2013, Grimm stated that he believed water fees should be waived for survivors of [[Hurricane Sandy]] who had been displaced from their homes. Under New York City's Department of Environmental Protection rules, all homeowners are subject to a minimum charge of $1.19 per day, even if a home uses no water during a given period. Residents who had been displaced from their homes for long periods of time received water bills over $500 for damaged, vacant properties. Grimm called the bills "ridiculous," saying, "That's $500 these people could use to replace a washer or dryer or refrigerator swept out to sea during Sandy."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Vigliotti|first1=Jonathan|title=Staten Island Sandy Victims Charged for Water in Vacant Homes|url=http://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/Water-Bills-Sandy-Staten-Island-Rep-Michael-Grimm-212630241.html|accessdate=July 24, 2014|publisher=NBC News|date=June 24, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

=====Confrontation with reporter=====
On January 28, 2014, [[NY1]]-TV political reporter Michael Scotto was interviewing Grimm in a balcony hallway of the U.S. Capitol building about the recently concluded [[2014 State of the Union Address]]. He then tried to question Grimm about a campaign finance investigation. Grimm said he would not discuss the investigation. As Scotto started to mention the investigation again, Grimm walked off. Scotto then turned to the camera and implied that Grimm did not want to face the issue on camera. Grimm then threatened Scotto, saying that he would "break [Scotto] in half," as well as threatening to throw Scotto over the balcony.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/01/29/us-usa-politics-grimm-idUSBREA0S0WM20140129|title=U.S. congressman apologizes for threatening to throw reporter over balcony|publisher=Reuters|date=January 29, 2014|accessdate=March 23, 2014|author=Thomas Ferraro}}</ref>

Grimm issued a statement defending his behavior, saying that he was annoyed by what he called a "disrespectful cheap shot" from Scotto.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/pages/202672/rep--grimm-threatens-ny1-reporter-following-state-of-the-union|title=Rep.

=====Flood insurance reform=====
In early 2014, Grimm and [[Bill Cassidy]] cosponsored the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act. In March 2014, the bill was passed by the U.S. Senate and signed into law by President Obama. The law repealed exponential increases in flood-insurance rates for homeowners in flood-prone areas, preventing "skyrocketing" flood insurance premiums for 5.5 million Americans.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Durrett|first1=Clint|title=Obama signs bill into law preventing flood insurance rate hikes|url=http://www.wdsu.com/news/local-news/new-orleans/obama-signs-bill-into-law-preventing-flood-insurance-rate-hikes/25093406#!bkSDCP|accessdate=July 24, 2014|publisher=WDSU|date=March 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wrobleski|first1=Tom|title=Senate passes flood insurance bill from Staten Island Rep.

=====Environmental views=====
According to ''[[Politico]]'', in April 2014, Grimm became "the first sitting House Republican to stop denying the science that humans cause climate change."

So I don't think the jury is out."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Goode|first1=Darren|title=Grimm's woes cast cloud on climate turnabout|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/04/michael-grimm-indictment-climate-change-106040.html|accessdate=July 24, 2014|publisher=Politico|date=April 25, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Harrison|first1=Timothy|title=Rep.

The investigation, which originally focused on Grimm's 2010 fundraising, branched out to include Grimm's prior business dealings. On April 25, 2014, Grimm's attorney was advised by the U.S. Attorney's office that his client would be indicted on criminal charges related to Healthalicious.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/04/26/nyregion/indictment-expected-for-representative-michael-grimm.html|title=Indictment Expected for Grimm, Staten Island Congressman|last=Rashbaum|first=William|publisher=New York Times|date=April 26, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/04/25/politics/congress-grimm/index.html|title=Feds close to filing charges against Rep.

On December 23, 2014, less than two months after winning reelection, Grimm pleaded guilty to one charge of felony tax evasion. He admitted to under-reporting Healthalicious's revenues by over $900,000 over four years and to filing false tax returns based on that under-reported income. He also admitted to using the under-reported receipts to pay restaurant expenses, as well as to make under-the-table cash payments to employees. As part of the plea bargain, the other charges were dropped, but Grimm admitted to two of the offenses in the original indictment: knowingly employing people ineligible to work in the United States and lying in a 2013 deposition. The crimes to which he pleaded guilty carried a prison sentence of up to 30 months.<ref name=DailyNewsPlea>{{cite news|url=http://nydailynews.com/news/politics/rep-michael-grimm-pleads-guilty-felony-count-tax-evas-article-1.2054723|title=Rep.

At first Grimm admitted making mistakes, but told a reporter he would "absolutely not" resign.<ref name=DailyNewsPlea/> But on December 29, 2014, it was reported that after discussing the matter with House Speaker [[John Boehner]], Grimm had changed his mind and would decline to take his seat for a third term. He resigned from Congress on January 5, 2015.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/michael-grimm-reportedly-decided-resign-congress-article-1.2060152 |title=Michael Grimm to resign from Congress: sources |publisher=NY Daily News |date= |accessdate=May 6, 2015}}</ref> A [[New York's 11th congressional district special election, 2015|special election]] to replace him was held on May 5, 2015, and Staten Island District Attorney [[Daniel M. Donovan, Jr.|Daniel Donovan]], a Republican, was elected to the seat.

On July 17, 2015, U.S. District Judge [[Pamela K. Chen]] suggested that Grimm's moral compass "needs some reorientation" and sentenced him to eight months in prison. He surrendered on September 22, 2015, after a brief delay for medical treatment.<ref name=NYDN20150922 /><ref>{{cite news|last1=Davis O'Brien|first1=Rebecca|title=Former U.S. Rep.

Had Grimm not resigned, his role in Congress would have likely been very limited. Longstanding House rules state that a member convicted of a felony should not take part in floor votes or committee work until the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]] reviews the matter. Although there is no constitutional rule barring a convicted felon from voting, Boehner and the Republican leadership would have strongly discouraged Grimm from doing so, and the House Ethics Committee has indicated in the past that convicted felons can be disciplined if they do take part in committee or floor votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/RL33229.pdf|title=Status of a Member of the House Who Has Been Indicted For or Convicted of A Felony|author=[[United States House of Representatives]]}}</ref>
