==Georgia House of Representatives (1985–1993)==

===Elections===
In 1984, he defeated [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] candidate Bobby Phillips 62%–38%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=699426 |title=GA State House 125 Race – Nov 06, 1984 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> He won re-election in 1986, 1988, and 1990 all unopposed.

===Committee assignments===
* House Committee on Ways and Means<ref>{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=BbkmAAAAIBAJ&sjid=6EQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6696,2597912&dq=jack+kingston&hl=en |title=Snow co-sponsors tax legislation for tax reform commission |work=Walker County Messenger |date=March 8, 1989 |page=6A |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–2015)==

===Elections===
In 1992, Kingston gave up his seat in the state house to pursue a [[United States Congress|congressional]] run in Georgia's 1st congressional district after five-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Robert Lindsay Thomas|Lindsay Thomas]] announced his retirement. The district had been one of the first areas of Georgia where the old-line conservative [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] voters had begun splitting their tickets and voting Republican at the national level. While conservative Democratics represented much of this area in the state legislature well into the 1990s, the district has only supported a Democratic nominee for president once since 1960, when [[Jimmy Carter]] swept every county in the state during his successful run for the presidency in [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]].

Kingston won the election with 58% of the vote, becoming the first Republican to represent this district since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], and the first to win an undisputed election in the district in 118 years. Kingston was helped by the 1990s round of redistricting, which significantly altered the district. The 1st had been based in Savannah for over a century. However, redistricting shifted most of Savannah's [[African-American]] residents to the newly created [[Georgia's 11th congressional district|11th District]].

Kingston was reelected 10 times, never dropping below 63% of the vote and even running unopposed in 1998 and 2004. Even when the district included all of Savannah (as was the case from 1996 to 2002 and again after the 2010s round of redistricting), Kingston was reelected without serious difficulty.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=914|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Jack Kingston|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-01-08}}</ref>

===Tenure===
From 2003 through the end of 2006, Kingston served as [[Republican Conference Vice-Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|vice-chairman]] of the [[House Republican Conference]], the sixth-ranking post among House Republicans. An early attempt to become chair of the influential [[House Appropriations Committee]] in the [[112th Congress]] (2011–2013) was unsuccessful. Kingston was an early supporter of earmark reforms and spending reductions.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1210/46077.html |title=Tea party favorite may not get chair |author=Simmi Aujla |publisher=Politico.Com |date=December 7, 2010 |accessdate=2012-08-28}}</ref> Throughout his tenure, Kingston has received over 40 awards on a diversity of issues from various interest groups.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Jack Kingston – Awards |url=http://www.kingston.house.gov/aboutjack/awards.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140516024634/http://kingston.house.gov/aboutjack/awards.htm |archivedate=May 16, 2014 }}</ref>

;Washington work week
Regarding the extension of the House work week from 3 days to 5 in 2006, Kingston commented, "Keeping us up here eats away at families. Marriages suffer. The Democrats could care less about families – that's what this says." He added, "Time away from Washington is just as important to being an effective member of Congress as time spent in the Capitol. When I'm here, people call me Mr. Congressman. When I'm home, people call me 'Jack, you stupid SOB, why did you vote that way?' It keeps me grounded."<ref>{{cite news|author=Lyndsey Layton |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/05/AR2006120501342_pf.html |title=Culture Shock on Capitol Hill: House to Work 5 Days a Week |work=The Washington Post |date=2006-12-06 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>

;School Lunch Program
In an address to the Jackson County Republican Party, on December 14, 2013, Kingston, who is on the House Agricultural Committee, which oversees the federal school lunch program for the underprivileged, commented that it may be beneficial for students to "...sweep the floor in the cafeteria" to promote a work ethic and "instill in them that there is, in fact, no such thing as a free lunch."<ref>{{cite news |author=Evan Bleier |publisher=UPI |url=http://www.upi.com/Odd_News/Blog/2013/12/19/Rep-Jack-Kingston-suggests-kids-sweep-the-floor-in-the-cafeteria-for-school-lunch/8751387458572/ |title=Rep. Jack Kingston suggests kids 'sweep the floor in the cafeteria' for school lunch |accessdate=December 19, 2013}}</ref>

Kingston has said he was not “allegedly” advocating that poor children be singled out but rather that all children should perform chores to learn work ethic but emphasised those students specifically that were getting free lunches as the ones that should be working. "This is not targeted to any one group. It would be very helpful for kids in any socio-economic group to do chores and learn the work ethic. Those kids aren't there because of any fault of their own and I never suggested that they were," Kingston said on CNN.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/20/georgia-congressman-defends-school-lunch-comments/ | work=CNN | title=Georgia congressman defends school lunch comments | date=December 20, 2013 |accessdate=April 7, 2015}}</ref>

If signed into law, individuals may be misled about the PPACA, as the $1.76 trillion figure is an estimate of the ''gross'' costs of the law's insurance coverage provisions, not the ''net'' costs of the entire law. On net, the CBO projects the PPACA to reduce the federal government's budget deficit by more than $100 billion over the next ten years;<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44176|title=CBO’s Estimate of the Net Budgetary Impact of the Affordable Care Act's Health Insurance Coverage Provisions Has Not Changed Much Over Time|last=Banthin|first=Jessica|date=May 14, 2013|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=November 27, 2014}}</ref> however, it is critical to note that CBO estimates must be calculated using ''only'' those figures provided by the bill's author, regardless of accuracy, and typically produce widely inaccurate and unreliable revenue projections on which to base a budget.
