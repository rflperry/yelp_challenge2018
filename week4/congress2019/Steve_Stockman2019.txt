From 1985 to 1986, he attended [[San Jacinto College]] but dropped out because he suffered from what he called "partying syndrome". In 1977 Stockman was reporting to jail for some traffic tickets and the jailers found [[valium]] in his possession after his girlfriend hid some in his underwear.

===Elections===
;1990
Stockman's first run for Congress was in March 1990 in [[Texas's 9th congressional district]].  The district, anchored by [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]] and [[Galveston, Texas|Galveston]], had been represented by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Representative Jack Brooks]] since 1953.  His primary challenger was Mayor Maury Meyers of [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]].<ref name=brookswins>{{cite news|title=Primaries '90 – Rep.

===Election===
In 2011 Stockman formed an [[exploratory committee]], Friends of Steve Stockman, to consider a run for the [[Texas's 14th congressional district|14th district]] seat being vacated by unsuccessful presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]. Stockman instead ran in 2012 in the newly created 36th District.  This includes the Harris County portion of Friendswood, where Stockman's home was located.  It was drawn to be heavily Republican, and it was understood that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's first congressman. In the May 29 primary, Stockman finished second in the first round, behind Stephen Vincent Takach, a financial planner. Takach finished with 22 percent of the vote, far short of the 50 percent threshold required to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm|title=Republican primary election returns, May 29, 2012|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=May 30, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120610141810/http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm|archivedate=June 10, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref> Stockman defeated Takach in the July 31 runoff 55%–45%, all but assuring his return to Congress after a 16-year absence.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/congress/texas|title=Texas Congressional Primaries – Election Results|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}</ref>

Stockman opposes the [[Affordable Care Act]] (ACA).

In January 2013, Stockman introduced the "Safe Schools Act," a bill that would repeal the [[Gun-Free School Zones Act of 1990]].

In February 2013, Stockman voted against the re-authorization of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], objecting to provisions in the bill that expanded protections for transgender victims of domestic violence. Stockman said, "This is helping the liberals, this is horrible. Unbelievable. What really bothers—it's called a women's act, but then they have men dressed up as women, they count that.

On April 25, 2014, Stockman stated that the [[House Ethics Committee]] was investigating a campaign finance reporting error made by a former campaign worker.

==Criminal case==

In March 2017, Stockman was arrested for allegedly conspiring to use contributions designated for a charity to fund his campaign and for personal use, a felony, under {{usc|18|371}}. According to the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), in January 2013, Stockman requested and received $350,000 in donations from an unidentified businessman. Stockman allegedly solicited the money by using the name of Life Without Limits, a Las Vegas-based nonprofit intended to help people who have experienced traumatic events. The donation was allegedly intended to be used to renovate the Freedom House in Washington D.C.<ref name="chronart">{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Dianna|last2=Kadifa|first2=Margaret|title=Former Rep.

The FBI also alleges that financial records indicate that Stockman "made no significant expenditures toward the purchase, renovation, or operation of the 'Freedom House,' which was never opened."<ref>Criminal Complaint and Affidavit, ''United States v. Stephen E. Stockman'', case no. 17-mj-00331, U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Texas.</ref> Federal prosecutors allege that Stockman conspired with Thomas Dodd, a former campaign worker and congressional special assistant. According to the ''Houston Chronicle'', the alleged conspiracy involved attempts "to bilk conservative foundations out of at least $775,000 in donations meant for charitable purposes or voter education". Dodd was indicted by a Federal grand jury in Houston and, on March 20, 2017, he pleaded guilty. Sentencing for Dodd is set for August 3, 2017.<ref>Lise Olsen, "Alleged scam by Stockman detailed," March 23, 2017, pages A1 and A13, ''Houston Chronicle''.</ref><ref>''United States v.

Former Stockman staffer Jason Posey entered a guilty plea before Chief U.S. District Judge [[Lee Rosenthal]] to counts of wire fraud, mail fraud, and money laundering and is due for sentencing on March 29, 2018. He faces a prison term of up to 45 years and a fine of more than $4.8 million, plus hundreds of thousands more in restitution. Posey admitted that at Stockman's direction he and Dodd illegally funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars from charitable foundations and individuals in charge of the foundations to pay for Stockman's campaigns and personal expenses.

On March 28, 2017, a federal grand jury issued a 28 count indictment that included 24 counts against Stockman. He was accused of obtaining $1.25 million under false pretenses and using the funds for his political campaigns.<ref>Josh Gerstein, "Ex-congressman Stockman indicted in Texas," March 28, 2017, politico.com, at [http://www.politico.com/story/2017/03/steve-stockman-texas-indicted-236616].</ref> Stockman was charged with eleven counts of money laundering, eight counts of mail and wire fraud, one count of conspiracy to make "conduit contributions" and false statements (conspiracy to conceal the real source of the contributions by false attribution), two counts of making false statements to the [[Federal Election Commission]], one count of making excessive contributions, and one count of willfully filing a false 2013 Federal income tax return by not reporting some of his income. Posey was charged with money laundering, mail and wire fraud, conspiracy to make conduit contributions and false statements, making false statements to the Federal Election Commission,  making excessive contributions, and falsification of records.<ref>News Release, "Former Texas Congressman and Associate Indicted on Conspiracy Charges," March 28, 2017, United States Department of Justice, at {{cite web |url=https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-texas-congressman-and-associate-indicted-conspiracy-charges |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2017-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170329141723/https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/former-texas-congressman-and-associate-indicted-conspiracy-charges |archivedate=March 29, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}.</ref><ref>First Superseding Indictment, March 28, 2017, docket entry 23, ''United States v.

His trial began on January 29, 2018.<ref>[http://www.courthousenews.com/former-texas-congressmans-fraud-trial-delayed-2018/ Former Texas Congressman’s Fraud Trial Pushed to 2018], ''[[Courthouse News Service]]'', Cameron Langford, April 27, 2017.

On April 12, 2018, Stockman was convicted by a jury on 23 of the 24 felony counts against him for which he faces up to 20 years in prison for each count and acquitted on one count of wire fraud. Because he was judged to be a flight risk, he was remanded into custody pending sentencing scheduled for August 2018.<ref name="texasmonthly.com">https://www.texasmonthly.com/politics/jury-peers-karma-convict-steve-stockman/</ref><ref>https://www.texastribune.org/2018/04/12/texas-congressman-steve-stockman-found-guilty-felony-charges/</ref>
