'''James Patrick Moran Jr.''' (born May 16, 1945) is a former [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|VA|8}} in [[Northern Virginia]], including the cities of [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] and [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], all of [[Arlington County, Virginia|Arlington County]], and a portion of [[Fairfax County, Virginia|Fairfax County]]. Moran served from 1991 to 2015, and is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Moran was the mayor of [[Alexandria, Virginia]] from 1985 to 1990, when he resigned to run for Congress. He defeated [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] incumbent [[Stanford Parris]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1990|general election]] on November 6, 1990, and was sworn in the following January. He is of [[Irish American|Irish]] descent, and is the son of professional football player [[James Moran Sr.]] and the brother of former [[Democratic Party of Virginia]] Chairman [[Brian Moran]].

==Early life, education, and business career==
Moran, the eldest of seven children, was born in [[Buffalo, New York]], and grew up in [[Natick, Massachusetts]], a suburb of Boston. His parents were Dorothy (née Dwyer) and [[James Moran Sr.]], a professional [[American football|football]] player for the [[Boston Redskins]] in 1935 and 1936; outside of football he worked as a probation officer.<ref name="brian moran campaign">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/02/10/AR2009021003914_2.html?sid=ST2009021004032|title=A Time to Reevaluate Family Ties|last=Gardner|first=Amy|date=February 11, 2009|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=April 16, 2010}}</ref> Both his father and mother were Roosevelt Democrats and supporters of the [[New Deal]]. Moran attended [[Marian High School (Framingham, Massachusetts)|Marian High School]] in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]].<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2006/people/va/rep_va08.htm Profile], nationaljournal.com; accessed September 3, 2015.</ref><ref>[http://wvtf.org/post/where-were-they-born-run Where Were they Born to Run?], wvtf.org; accessed September 3, 2015.</ref>

Moran played [[college football]] on an athletic scholarship at the [[College of the Holy Cross]],<ref name="Washington Post bio">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/james-moran-d-va/gIQAbgrNAP_topic.html|title=Biography of James Moran|work=Washington Post |accessdate=March 6, 2012|first=Ed|last=O'Keefe}}</ref> where his father had been a football star in the early 1930s. Moran received his B.A. in economics in 1967. In 1970, he received a [[Master of Public Administration]] from the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. After college, Moran followed his father's footstep to become an amateur boxer, and during a campaign in 1992, he admitted that he had used [[marijuana]] during his early twenties.<ref name="marijuana">{{cite news|last=Baker|first=Peter|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1030794.html|title=Moran Tried Marijuana In His Early Twenties; Representative Says Activity Less Serious Than Rival's|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 20, 1992}}</ref> After a brief career as a stockbroker and graduate school attendance, Moran moved to Washington, D.C.<ref name="Washington Post bio"/>

==Early political career==
He worked for five years at the [[Department of Health, Education, and Welfare]], as a budget officer, then became a senior specialist for budgetary and fiscal policy at the [[Library of Congress]]. His final position, from 1976 to 1979, was on the staff of [[U.S. Senate Committee on Appropriations]].<ref name="WebsiteBio"/>

In 1979, Moran was elected to the [[Alexandria, Virginia]], [[City Council]]. He was [[deputy mayor]] from 1982 until his resignation in 1984 as part of a ''[[nolo contendere]]'' plea bargain to a misdemeanor conflict of interest charge, which courts later erased. The incident stemmed from charges that Moran had used money from a [[political action committee]] to rent a tuxedo and buy Christmas cards; both of which were later judged by the [[Commonwealth Attorney]] to "fit the definition of constituent services", and were dismissed.<ref name="no violation">{{cite news|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1P2-1140015.html|title=Prosecutor Finds No Violation In Moran's Use of PAC Money|last=Jenkins|first=Kent|date=July 31, 1990|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 15, 2009}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

In 1985, Moran was elected Mayor of Alexandria. He was reelected in 1988,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/73606397.html?dids=73606397:73606397&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT |title=Moran Beats Ring in Alexandria; Mayor Solidifies Comeback; Democrats Win 5 of 6 Council Seats |work=Washington Post |date=May 11, 1988|author=Kent Jenkins Jr.}}</ref> and resigned after he was elected to Congress in November 1990.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
{{See also |United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2012#District 8}}
In 1990, Moran first won election to the [[United States House of Representatives]], defeating five-term Republican incumbent [[Stanford Parris|Stan Parris]]. During the campaign, Parris, referring to the issue of the [[Gulf War]], said, "The only three people I know who support [[Saddam Hussein]]'s position are [[Muammar Gaddafi|Moammar Gadhafi]], [[Yasser Arafat]], and Jim Moran." Moran angrily responded by saying that Parris was "a deceitful, fatuous jerk", and that he wanted "to break his nose".<ref name="virginian-pilot">{{cite news|last=Fiske|first=Warren|title=8th District Face-Off of Parris, Moran Spiciest of VA.

In the next two elections, Moran faced Republican lawyer [[Kyle McSlarrow]]. During the 1992 campaign, McSlarrow accused Moran of "lying to the public". Moran responded by portraying McSlarrow as a drug abuser, referring to the candidate's admitted use of [[cocaine]] and [[marijuana]] while at the [[University of Virginia]].<ref name="slurfest">{{cite news|last=Jenkins|first=Kent|title=Moran and McSlarrow Swap Blame in Slurfest|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 21, 1992}}</ref> Moran compared McSlarrow to Parris, saying that Parris had "[t]en times more integrity than McSlarrow. He didn't create lies."<ref name="washtimes">{{cite news|title=Moran rates foe lower than Parris|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=October 27, 1992}}</ref> Moran defeated McSlarrow with 56 percent of the vote.  He was helped by the 1990s redistricting, which cut out some of the more Republican-leaning areas of his district.

In 1994, Moran's daughter Dorothy was suffering from an inoperable brain tumor. During the campaign, neither Moran or McSlarrow used the negative tactics of two years earlier. On his campaign strategy that election, McSlarrow said "It would not be a community service to shut down this campaign, but I probably will not talk much about Moran."<ref name="dorothy moran"/>  Moran was reelected with 59 percent of the vote.

In 1998 and 2000, Moran faced Republican and [[flat tax]] advocate Demaris H. Miller. In the 1998 campaign Miller accused Moran of flip-flopping in his support of President [[Bill Clinton]], after Moran, who had been a vocal supporter of the Clinton White House, voted in favor of opening an impeachment inquiry following the [[Monica Lewinsky scandal]].<ref name="impeachment">{{cite news|last=Pae|first=Peter|title=Moran to Back Impeachment Inquiry|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/moran100898.htm|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 8, 1998}}</ref>

In 2002, Moran defeated Republican S. C. Tate and Independent R. V. Crickenberger.
  
In June 2004, Moran, for the first time since his election in 1990, had a Democratic opponent in a primary. Moran defeated Alexandria attorney Andrew M. Rosenberg, 59% to 41%.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/news/2004/jun/08/no-surprise-moran-dominates-in-city/ |title=No Surprise — Moran Dominates in City |date=June 8, 2004 |work=Alexandria Gazette Packet }}</ref> In November, he defeated Republican Lisa Marie Cheney.

In 2006, Moran defeated Republican challenger T. M. Odonoghue and Independent J. T. Hurysz.

In 2008, Moran again had a primary challenger; he won with 86% of the vote. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2008|general election]], Moran faced Republican Mark Ellmore and [[Independent Green]] Ron Fisher. He won with 68 percent of the vote to Elmore's 30 percent.<ref name=SBE_Nov2008>{{cite web|url=https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2008/07261AFC-9ED3-410F-B07D-84D014AB2C6B/Official/6_s.shtml |publisher=Commonwealth Of Virginia |accessdate=August 13, 2009 |format=PDF |title=November 2008 Official Results |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005215807/https://www.voterinfo.sbe.virginia.gov/election/DATA/2008/07261AFC-9ED3-410F-B07D-84D014AB2C6B/Official/6_s.shtml |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df= }}</ref>

In 2012, Moran faced another primary challenger from Navy veteran Bruce Shuttleworth. A controversy erupted when the Democratic Party of Virginia disqualified Shuttleworth, saying he had fallen 17 signatures short of the 1,000 threshold required. Shuttleworth cried foul and filed a federal lawsuit; the party then allowed Shuttleworth on the ballot.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pershing |first=Ben |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/jim-moran-challenger-sues-after-being-barred-from-democratic-primary-ballot/2012/04/09/gIQAJSIN6S_blog.html |title=After initial rejection, Moran challenger will be on primary ballot |publisher=The Washington Post |date=April 9, 2012 |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref> Moran went on to win by a sizable margin.  In November, Moran defeated Republican J. Patrick Murray, Independent Jason J. Howell, and Independent Green Janet Murphy, winning 64% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Moran represented [[Virginia's 8th congressional district]], an area in [[Northern Virginia]] that is just across the [[Potomac River]] from Washington, D.C.; the district includes [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]] county, and the cities of [[Alexandria, Virginia|Alexandria]], [[Falls Church, Virginia|Falls Church]] and parts of [[Fairfax County|Fairfax]]. The redistricting that followed the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]] also gave Moran a portion of [[Reston, Virginia]]. His district is located in the [[Dulles Technology Corridor]] and is the home of many federal defense contractors as well as a significant number of those who work in the information technology industry. Many federal employees also reside within the district, mostly due to its proximity to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] and because the [[United States Department of Defense]] and various other agencies are headquartered there.<ref name="8th District Info">{{cite web|url=http://moran.house.gov/district.shtml|title=Virginia's 8th District|accessdate=February 28, 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202202958/http://moran.house.gov/district.shtml <!--Added by H3llBot-->|archivedate=February 2, 2010}}</ref>

During the mid nineties, Moran co-founded and later co-chaired the [[New Democrat Coalition]], a coalition of [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] lawmakers who consider themselves to be [[Centrism|moderates]] with regard to commerce, budgeting, and economic legislation, but vote as liberals on social issues.<ref name=DLC>Democratic Leadership Council: [http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=86&subid=194&contentid=3775 The New Democratic Credo] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203140414/http://www.dlc.org/ndol_ci.cfm?kaid=86&subid=194&contentid=3775 |date=December 3, 2010 }}. Retrieved February 14, 2010.</ref> Moran was also a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] (CPC), the largest caucus operating within the Democratic caucus, which works to advance [[progressivism|progressive]] issues and opinions.

====1990s====
In 1995, Moran and California Republican [[Duke Cunningham]] had to be restrained by the [[Capitol Police]] after a shoving match on the house floor over President Bill Clinton's decision to send U.S. troops to [[Bosnia]]. "I thought he had been bullying too many people for too long, and I told him so," Moran recalled. "He said he didn't mean to be so accusatory ... After that, he would bring me candy from California." Moran said that after the encounter he found Cunningham crying in the cloakroom.<ref name="cunningham">{{cite news|last=Romano|first=Lois|title=Cunningham Friends Baffled By His Blunder Into Bribery|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/12/03/AR2005120301046.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=December 4, 2005}}</ref>

During the final years of the [[Clinton administration]], Moran was critical of the [[President of the United States|President]]: In 1998, during the [[Monica Lewinsky]] [[Lewinsky scandal|scandal]], Moran was one of only 31 House Democrats to support launching a formal impeachment inquiry into [[President of the United States|President]] [[Bill Clinton]]. He told ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine that "This whole sordid mess is just too tawdry and tedious and embarrassing ... It's like a novel that just became too full of juicy parts and bizarre, sleazy characters."<ref name="time clinton">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1998/08/20/time/congress.reax.html|title=Can Clinton calm angry Democrats?|last=Carney|first=James|date=August 31, 1998|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref> Moran is also reported to have told First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] that if she had been his sister, he would have punched her husband in the nose. Moran eventually decided not to vote for [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]], explaining that Clinton had not compromised the country's security, and that he still respected him for what he had accomplished as President. Moran proposed a resolution demanding that Clinton confess to a pattern of "dishonest and illegal conduct" surrounding his sexual involvement with [[Monica Lewinsky]].<ref name="no impeachment">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/special/clinton/stories/moran121198.htm|title=Moran to Vote Against Impeachment|last=Hsu|first=Spencer|date=December 11, 1998|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=March 14, 2010}}</ref><ref name="clinton inquiry">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/stories/1998/10/08/defect/|title=31 Democrats defect, support impeachment inquiry|date=October 8, 1998|publisher=CNN|accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref>

====2000s====
Moran was voted High Technology Legislator of the Year by the Information Technology Industry Council and was voted into the [[AeA|American Electronics Association]] Hall of Fame for his work on avoiding the [[Y2K|Year 2000]] crisis and his support of the [[Information Technology|IT Industry]] and defense contractors in [[Northern Virginia]]. He cosponsored failed bills in 2005 to provide the [[Washington, D.C.|District of Columbia]] with [[D.C. voting rights|a House seat]] and to prohibit [[Animal slaughter|slaughter]] of horses.<ref>

On April 28, 2006, Moran, along with four other members of Congress (the now-deceased Rep. [[Tom Lantos]] of California, [[Sheila Jackson Lee]] of Texas, and [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|James McGovern]] and [[John Olver]] of [[Massachusetts]]), and six other activists, were arrested for disorderly conduct in front of the Sudanese embassy in Washington, D.C., and spent 45 minutes in a jail cell before being released. They were protesting the alleged role of [[Sudan]]'s government in ethnic cleansing in [[Darfur]]. According to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', "Their protest and civil disobedience was designed to embarrass the [[Politics of Sudan|military dictatorship's]] ongoing genocide of its non-Arab citizens."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2006/04/28/MNG4RIH93T7.DTL|title= Five members of Congress arrested over Sudan protest – San Francisco|work=San Francisco Chronicle|publisher=Hearst Communications|location=San Francisco, California|date=April 28, 2006|last=Dowle|first=Jim|accessdate=February 15, 2010}}</ref>

The day after the [[Virginia Tech Massacre]] in 2007, Moran told a local radio station that the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]] should be reinstated despite the fact that the shooting had been carried out by a pistol legal under the assault weapons ban, thus would have had no effect upon the shooting, and blamed the [[National Rifle Association]], which he accused of getting a "free ride", and President [[George W. Bush]] for blocking [[gun control]] legislation. He further warned that if gun control legislation was not passed, then shootings such as the one at [[Virginia Tech]] will happen "time and time again." He later dismissed charges that he was politicizing the shooting, telling ''[[The Politico|Politico]]'' that "as a legislator, your immediate reaction is to think something could be done to avoid this. I don't know why the idea of figuring out how to avoid it is a political partisan issue."<ref name="politico"/>

Shortly before the [[Democratic Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|June 2008]] [[Virginia]] Democratic primary, Moran endorsed Senator [[Barack Obama]] of [[Illinois]] for the presidency over New York Senator and former First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]]. Explaining his endorsement, he told a local newspaper that the long-term goal of closing Alexandria's coal-fired power plant would be more attainable under Obama than under Clinton. Obama won the Virginia primary, and carried the state when he won the [[United States presidential election, 2008|general election]] in November.<ref name="connection10">{{cite news|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=315241&paper=72&cat=104 |title=Moran Seeks 10th Term |last=Pope |first=Michael Lee |date=May 22, 2009 |publisher=The Springfield Connection |accessdate=April 11, 2010 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

In May 2009, Moran introduced a bill that would restrict [[Television advertisement|broadcast advertisements]] for [[erectile dysfunction]] or [[penis enlargement|male enhancement]] medication. He said that such ads were [[morality|indecent]] and should be prohibited on radio and television between the hours of 6&nbsp;am and 10&nbsp;pm, in accordance with [[Federal Communications Commission]] policy. Later that year, Moran and former presidential candidate and former [[Governor of Vermont]] [[Howard Dean]] held a town hall meeting on the issue of health care at [[South Lakes High School]] in [[Reston, Virginia]]. The meeting was interrupted several times by protesters, most notably [[pro-life]] activist [[Randall Terry]], who, along with about half a dozen supporters, caused such a commotion that he had to be escorted out by police. The incident was replayed several times over the next few weeks on television as an example of the tension at town halls that fall.<ref name="politico town hall">{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0809/26440.html|title=Jim Moran, Howard Dean face town hall skeptics|last=Lovley|first=Erika|date=August 26, 2009|publisher=Politico.com|accessdate=May 11, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cspan.org/Watch/Media/2009/08/25/HP/A/22434/Howard+Dean+Rep+Moran+Health+Care+Town+Hall+in+Reston+VA.aspx|title=C-SPAN Video Player – Howard Dean & Rep.

In February 2010, on the House floor, Moran called for the repeal of [[Don't ask, don't tell|Don't Ask, Don't Tell]], the military policy of discharging soldiers on active duty who are openly homosexual. He spoke about a letter penned by a gay soldier who was then serving in the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–2014)|Afghanistan War]], who had "learned that a fellow soldier was also gay, only after he was killed by an [[improvised explosive device|IED]] in Iraq. The partner of the deceased soldier wrote the unit to say how much the victim had loved the military; how they were the only family he had ever known... This immutable human trait, sexual orientation, like the color of one's skin, does not affect one's integrity, their honor, our commitment to their country. Soldiers serving their country in combat should not have their sacrifices compounded by having to struggle with an antiquated "Don't ask, don't tell" policy.

As a member of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]], Moran worked to allocate federal funding to projects in [[Northern Virginia]], usually in the technology and defense industries.

====2010s====
Moran became the [[ranking member]] of the subcommittee after the Democratic Party lost control of the House of Representatives following the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November 2010 elections]].

After President Obama's [[2011 State of the Union Address]], Moran was interviewed by [[Alhurra]], an Arab television network. During the interview, he said, "a lot of people in [the United States of America] ... don't want to be governed by an African-American" and that the Democrats lost seats in the 2010 election for "the same reason the Civil War happened in the United States ... the Southern states, particularly the slaveholding states, didn't want to see a president who was opposed to slavery."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/onpolitics/post/2011/01/democrat-jim-moran-racism-2010-elections-/1?csp=34news|title=Democrat says racism played role in election losses|work=OnPolitics|publisher=USAToday|date=January 28, 2011|accessdate=January 28, 2011|last=Camilia|first= Catalina}}</ref> The remarks received national media attention.<ref>{{cite web|last=Epstein |first=Jennifer |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0111/48315.html |title=Jim Moran: Racism fueled Democrats' midterm losses |publisher=Politico |date=January 27, 2011 |accessdate=September 30, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/01/28/jim-moran-gop-black-president_n_814978.html |title=Democratic Rep.

On March 27, 2012, Moran introduced the AUTISM Educators Act that would implement a five-year pilot program allowing public schools to partner with colleges, universities, and non-profit organizations to promote teaching skills for educators working with high functioning students with [[autism]].  "This legislation is the product of a grassroots effort by parents, instructors, school officials and caring communities," he said. "Autism Spectrum Disorders are being diagnosed at an exploding rate. We have a responsibility to do everything in our power to provide the best education for our children." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://fairfaxnews.com/2012/04/rep-moran-introduces-autism-educators-act-of-2012/|title=Rep.

In 2012, Moran was recognized as a "Problem Solver" by the bipartisan grassroots organization No Labels for "continued willingness to work across the aisle and find common ground with members of the opposite party on important issues. His attitude is what Congress needs more of.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nolabels.org/press-releases/no-labels-gives-problem-solvers-seal-jim-moran |archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20121109123649/http://www.nolabels.org/press-releases/no-labels-gives-problem-solvers-seal-jim-moran |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-11-09 |title=No Labels: Stop Fighting.

Moran joined Virginia Reps. [[Gerry Connolly]] and [[Bobby Scott (U.S. politician)|Bobby Scott]] in asking Attorney General Eric Holder for a Department of Justice investigation into allegations of voter fraud in Virginia following charges that a contractor to the Republican Party of Virginia was caught discarding completed voter registration forms in a [[Harrisonburg, Virginia]] dumpster. Shortly thereafter, [[conservatism|conservative]] activist [[James O'Keefe]] released a video alleging involvement by Moran's son in a voting fraud discussion; see [[#Voter fraud allegations]] below.

=== Federal employees ===
Moran introduced and supported legislation to increase benefits and pay for federal workers, in part due to the Federal Government's large presence within the 8th District – 114,000 federal employees work within its bounds. He introduced a bill signed into law that allows FERS employees to buy back credit from a lapse in federal service toward annuity payments, with the goal of attracting individuals from the private sector back to public service.

Moran listed the environment as one of his top issues, citing his high marks from the [[League of Conservation Voters]] and the [[Sierra Club]].

He also voted to ban logging on [[federal lands]]. He criticized the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) for inaction on [[climate change]], saying that "EPA had a historic opportunity to tackle head-on one of the greatest threats to our existence—global warming.

===Economy, budget, and taxes===
Moran often broke with his party on economic issues. For example, he supported [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA) and other [[free trade]] agreements,<ref name=issues2000/> harsher bankruptcy laws, and increased restrictions on the right to bring [[class action suit]]s.<ref name="issues2000"/>

He voted for the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]] and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (TARP) Reform and Accountability Act. He supported pay-as-you-go budgeting and believed "that the American government needs to strive to build up a surplus when possible, so that there are funds to support and sustain our country during tough financial times." Moran called former President [[George W. Bush]] "Fiscally irresponsible."<ref name=issues2000/><ref>[http://moran.house.gov/issues_economy.shtml Op Eds & Columns: EPA Decision Sets Back Global Warming Efforts] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100124060314/http://moran.house.gov/issues_economy.shtml |date=January 24, 2010 }}, Moran.House.gov.

=== Social programs ===
Moran called [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] "a safe, stable, and dependable source of financial assistance for [[retirement|retirees]] and their families," and strongly opposes privatizing Social Security, saying that it would "cripple the system". It was his position that any changes to the current system must "promote its long-term solvency without disrupting the core principles on which the program was founded."<ref>[http://moran.house.gov/issues_socialsecurity.shtml "Protecting Social Security"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214141800/http://moran.house.gov/issues_socialsecurity.shtml |date=February 14, 2010 }}.

Moran voted against authorizing the [[Iraq War]] in 2002 and did not support the troop increase for the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan War]] proposed by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]] in 2009, saying first that he appreciated Obama's "careful consideration regarding the U.S.'s engagement in Afghanistan", but later defining the issues on which he and the President disagreed:

<blockquote>Our security concern is Al-Qaeda, not the Taliban. Eight years ago we went into Afghanistan to eliminate al-Qaeda and the "safe haven" that Afghanistan's Taliban were providing the terrorist group responsible for the 9/11 attacks. Al-Qaeda has no significant presence today in all of Afghanistan.... Instead of increasing our troop presence, the U.S. should limit its mission in Afghanistan to securing strategic Afghan population centers with the troops currently on the ground.<ref>[http://moran.house.gov/apps/list/press/va08_moran/afghani.shtml Press Release: Moran Statement on U.S. policy in Afghanistan] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100105221500/http://moran.house.gov/apps/list/press/va08_moran/afghani.shtml |date=January 5, 2010 }}.

====Comments prior to the invasion of Iraq====
Prior to the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], Moran told an anti-war audience in [[Reston, Virginia]], that if "it were not for the strong support of the Jewish community for this war with Iraq, we would not be doing this. The leaders of the Jewish community are influential enough that they could change the direction of where this is going, and I think they should". This brought criticism from many of his own party, including, among others, Senate Democratic Leader [[Tom Daschle]] and Senator [[Joe Lieberman]].

<blockquote>I should not have singled out the Jewish community and regret giving any impression that its members are somehow responsible for the course of action being pursued by the administration, or are somehow behind an impending war... What I was trying to say is that if more organizations in this country, including religious groups, were more outspoken against war, then I do not think we would be pursuing war as an option.<ref name="archives.cnn.com">[http://archives.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0303/11/asb.00.html CNN.com – Transcripts: NewsNight with Aaron Brown, March 11, 2003].

=== Animal rights ===
Moran was in favor of stronger prohibitions against [[animal fighting]].  He sponsored legislation to penalize those who "knowingly attend animal fights and allow minors to attend."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wjla.com/articles/2011/07/vick-speaks-on-the-hill-to-support-moran-s-anti-dogfighting-bil-63889.html|title=Vick speaks on the Hill to support Moran's anti-dogfighting bill|author=Sinclair Broadcast Group|work=WJLA}}</ref>  He sponsored legislation limiting federal funding for horse slaughter inspection plants, effectively preventing the practice.

==Controversies==

===MBNA loan===

Moran's support for harsher bankruptcy law provisions and sponsorship of stricter bankruptcy legislation brought allegations in 2002 that his support came in return for financial favors by financial institutions which could benefit from such laws. In January 1998, one month before he introduced the legislation, credit card bank [[MBNA]] advocated that it would restrict the ability of consumer debtors to declare bankruptcy. Moran received a $447,000 debt consolidation loan at over 10% [[interest rate]].

The [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] at the time, [[Tim Kaine]], joined [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] lawmakers in calling for a [[House Ethics Committee]] investigation into the loan, saying that Moran had made "an error in judgment" by accepting it. In his own defense, Moran said that the timing of the legislation's introduction was coincidental and had nothing to do with the loan. MBNA spokesman Brian Dalphon said that the bank had offered the mortgage package not knowing that Moran was a member of Congress, and that the loan "made good business sense" because with the mortgage loan, "we improved our position by getting security for an unsecured loan.... He had credit cards with us, he was having financial difficulties; this put him in a better position to be able to pay us back from a cash-flow standpoint."<ref name="New York Times">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/08/09/us/bankruptcy-bill-opponents-criticize-loan.html|title=Bankruptcy Bill Opponents Criticize Loan|last=Shenon|first=Philip|date=August 9, 2002|work=New York Times|accessdate=March 7, 2010}}</ref><ref name="sundaystar">{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1298&dat=20020707&id=o_EyAAAAIBAJ&sjid=ywgGAAAAIBAJ&pg=6649,1357696|title=Report: Moran backed lender's cause after loan|date=July 7, 2002|publisher=Sunday Free Lance-Star|page=7|accessdate=March 13, 2010}}</ref>

===PMA group===

The [[House Ethics Committee]] investigated several members of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Defense|House Defense Appropriations Subcommittee]], including Moran, [[Peter J. Visclosky]], [[Norm Dicks]], [[Marcy Kaptur]] and the late [[John Murtha]], who was the chairman at the time, for a conflict of interest in the allocation of the government contracts to clients of the [[PMA Group]], which donated nearly a million dollars to Moran's [[political action committee]], as well as a significant amount of money to the gubernatorial campaign of Moran's younger brother, [[Brian Moran|Brian]].<ref name="Brian Moran PMA">{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/17/us/politics/17moran.html?_r=1|title=Brother's Role in Congress Carries Weight in Race|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David|author2=Nixon, Ron|date=April 16, 2009|work=The New York Times|accessdate=April 1, 2010}}</ref> Moran said that he was unaware of "who made donations", and "how much they gave", and therefore was not affected by the donations when allocating the funding.<ref name="thinwall">{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/06/AR2010030602374.html|title=Thin wall separates lobbyist contributions, earmarks|last=Smith|first=R.

In February 2010, the panel cleared Moran and the others, saying that they violated no laws. The panel concluded, as part of its 305-page report, that ''"simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor... does not support a claim that a member's actions are being influenced by campaign contributions"'' .<ref name="Bloomberg">{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/85636792.html |title=Ethics panel clears Murtha on donations |last=Salant |first=Jonathan |date=February 27, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=February 28, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302141857/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/85636792.html |archivedate=March 2, 2010 }}</ref> After PMA's founder, Paul Magliocchetti, plead guilty in September 2010 to six years of campaign finance fraud,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0910/42690.html |title=Paul Magliocchetti pleads guilty|publisher=Politico |date=September 24, 2010 |author= John Bresnahan|accessdate=February 25, 2012}}</ref> Moran said that he would not return the $177,700 in PMA Group-related donations that he received from 1990 to 2010.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.connectionnewspapers.com/article.asp?article=344602&paper=59&cat=104 |title=Donations Questioned and Defended |first=Michael Lee |last=Pope |work=Alexandria Gazette Packet |accessdate=March 11, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}</ref>

===Insider trading===
In November 2011, author [[Peter Schweizer]] published a book, ''Throw Them All Out'', which included an allegation that Moran used information he got from a September 16, 2008 briefing, in which Treasury Secretary [[Henry Paulson]] and [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Ben Bernanke]] warned of an [[2008 financial crisis|impending financial crisis]], for his stock market activity:

{{quote|September 17, 2008, was by far Moran's most active trading day of the year. He dumped shares in Goldman Sachs, General Dynamics, Franklin Resources, Flowserve Corporation, Ecolabs, Edison International, Electronic Arts, DirecTV, Conoco, Procter & Gamble, AT&T, Apple, CVS, Cisco, Chubb, and a dozen more companies.}}

Schweizer alleged that Moran made more than 90 trades that day.<ref name="Democrats benefited">{{cite news|last=Weigel|first=David|title=Democrats Benefited from 2008 Trades, Too|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2011/11/14/democrats_benefited_from_2008_trades_too.html|accessdate=November 28, 2011|newspaper=Slate|date=November 14, 2011}}</ref> Moran defended himself by citing that the trades were made in the midst of the Great Recession and that all one had to do was turn on the television to see that stock prices were dropping fast.

===Voter fraud allegations===
On October 24, 2012 a video was released showing Patrick B. Moran, the Congressman's son and a field director with his father's campaign, discussing a plan to cast fraudulent ballots proposed to him by someone who posed as a fervent supporter of the campaign.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-20076304 | work=BBC News | title=US politician's son resigns over 'voter fraud' video | date=October 25, 2012}}</ref> In response to the person's suggestion about trying to cast votes in the names of 100 inactive voters, Patrick Moran attempted to discourage the scheme, but also discussed the practical difficulties of forging documentation such as utility bills.<ref name="APWashPost25Oct12"/>  The person he was speaking with was actually a conservative activist with [[James O'Keefe]]'s Project Veritas, and was secretly recording the conversation.<ref name="APWashPost25Oct12">{{Citation | last = Haines | first = Errin | title = Jim Moran's son resigns from campaign amid video furor | newspaper = [[Washington Post]] | date = October 24, 2012 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/jim-morans-son-resigns-campaign-amid-video-furor/2012/10/24/95ea4a56-1e23-11e2-b647-bb1668e64058_story.html | accessdate = February 2, 2013}}</ref> Patrick Moran resigned from the campaign, saying he didn't want to be a distraction during the election, and stating, "at no point have I, or will I ever endorse any sort of illegal or unethical behavior. At no point did I take this person seriously. He struck me as being unstable and joking, and for only that reason did I humor him. In hindsight, I should have immediately walked away, making it clear that there is no place in the electoral process for even the suggestion of illegal behavior, joking or not."<ref name="APWashPost25Oct12"/>

The following day, the [[Arlington County]] Police Department opened a criminal probe into the matter.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/virginia-politics/post/police-open-investigation-into-alleged-moran-campaign-offense/2012/10/25/4f61d43a-1ede-11e2-ba31-3083ca97c314_blog.html|title=Police open investigation into alleged fraud in Moran campaign|author1=Allison Klein |author2=Errin Haines |author3=Ben Pershing |date=October 25, 2012|work=Washington Post}}</ref> Two days after the video was released, the Virginia State Board of Elections asked [[Attorney General of Virginia]] [[Ken Cuccinelli]] to investigate Moran's campaign for voter fraud.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/virginia-election-officials-ask-attorney-general-to-investigate-congressmans-son-filmmaker/2012/10/26/e3337140-1fc0-11e2-8817-41b9a7aaabc7_story.html|title=Sorry, we can't seem to find the page you're looking for.|date=October 26, 2012|publisher=|via=washingtonpost.com}}</ref> On January 31, 2013, Arlington County announced that the investigation, by its police department in collaboration with the Offices of the Virginia Attorney General and the Arlington County Commonwealth's Attorney, had concluded and that no charges would be brought.  The County stated: "Patrick Moran and the Jim Moran for Congress campaign provided full cooperation throughout the investigation. Despite repeated attempts to involve the party responsible for producing the video, they failed to provide any assistance."<ref>{{cite web | title = UPDATE: Police Investigation of Election Offense Allegations Concludes| publisher = [[Arlington County, Virginia]]| date = January 31, 2013 | url =http://news.arlingtonva.us/update:-police-investigation-of-election-offense-allegations-concludes | accessdate =February 2, 2013}}</ref>

==Later career==
In February 2015, Moran joined McDermmott, Will, and Emery law firm in Washington, DC as a Senior Legislative Advisor.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.mwe.com/en/team/m/moran-james-p-jim|title=James P. Moran - Team - McDermott Will and Emery|work=mwe.com}}</ref>
