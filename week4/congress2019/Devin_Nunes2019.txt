'''Devin Gerald Nunes''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|uː|n|ɛ|s}};<ref>{{YouTube|JsB3Nuo-4Zg|"New Day - Devin Nunes"}}</ref> born October 1, 1973) is an American politician serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|22}} since 2003. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], he serves as chairman of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] and was a member of [[Donald Trump|President Trump]]'s [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|transition team]].<ref name="latimes-1478893307">{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-rep-devin-nunes-named-to-trump-s-1478893307-htmlstory.html|title=Essential Politics November archives|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-03-26}}</ref> Nunes's district, numbered as the 21st from 2003 to 2013, is in the [[San Joaquin Valley]] and includes most of western [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]] and much of eastern [[Fresno County, California|Fresno County]].

In March 2017, the U.S. House intelligence committee, which Nunes chairs, launched an investigation into possible [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]]. On April 6, 2017, he temporarily stepped aside from leading that investigation while the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] investigated allegations, which Nunes denied, that he had improperly disclosed classified information to the public.<ref name="LAT_2017-04-06">{{cite news |title=Devin Nunes says he's temporarily stepping aside from Russia probe |author=Cloud, David S.|date=April 6, 2017|url=http://www.latimes.com/politics/washington/la-na-essential-washington-updates-devin-nunes-says-he-s-temporarily-1491486690-htmlstory.html |newspaper=The Los Angeles Times |access-date=April 6, 2017}}</ref><ref name=Cbs2017-04-06 /> In December 2017, the [[United States House Committee on Ethics]] closed its investigation without taking any action against Nunes.<ref name=cleardec />

In February 2018, the [[Nunes memo]], a four-page memorandum written for Nunes by his staff, was released by Nunes to the public. The memo alleged a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] conspiracy against [[Donald Trump]]. In March 2018, the U.S. House intelligence committee finished its investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election, concluding that there had not been collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The committee also concluded that Russia had not sought Trump's election.

In 2009, Nunes wrote in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' that he became an entrepreneur at age 14 when he bought seven head of young cattle, learning quickly how to profit from his investment.<ref>{{cite news|last=Nunes|first=Devin|title=California's Gold Rush Has Been Reversed|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123154816733469917|access-date=December 16, 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=January 10, 2009}}</ref>

In 2001, he was appointed by President [[George W.

==Election history==
In 2002 Nunes ran for the Republican nomination in the 21st congressional district, a new district created through [[Apportionment (politics)|reapportionment]] after the [[2000 United States Census]]. His principal opponents in the crowded seven-way primary were former Fresno mayor [[Jim Patterson (California politician)|Jim Patterson]] and [[California State Assembly|state Assemblyman]] [[Mike Briggs (politician)|Mike Briggs]]. Nunes was the only major candidate from Tulare County; Patterson and Briggs were both from Fresno. This was critical, as 58% of the district's population was in Tulare County.<ref name="nj">{{cite news |title=(Title is lost) |publisher=National Journal |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/pubs/almanac/2008/people/ca/rep_ca21.htm}}{{dead link|date=August 2017}}</ref> Patterson and Briggs split the vote in Fresno County, allowing Nunes to win by a four-point margin over Patterson, his nearest competitor. Nunes won 46.5% of the vote in Tulare County and 28.1% of the vote in Fresno County. Nunes was also helped by a strong showing in the rural part of the district.<ref name=Primary2002 /> He won the endorsements of the California Farm Bureau and ''[[The Fresno Bee]]''.<ref name="nj" /> The district is solidly Republican, and Nunes coasted to victory in November. He has been reelected seven times against only nominal [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opposition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-primary/pdf/85-95-cd.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2012-03-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120321104908/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2010-primary/pdf/85-95-cd.pdf |archivedate=March 21, 2012 |df= }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Election Summary Report, Statewide Direct Primary Election, June 8, 2010, Summary For Jurisdiction Wide, All Counters, All Races, Final Official Report |date=July 6, 2010 |publisher=Fresno County Clerk/Registrar of Voters |url=http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/DepartmentPage.aspx?id=43518 |access-date=January 11, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101109051133/http://www.co.fresno.ca.us/DepartmentPage.aspx?id=43518 |archive-date=November 9, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}</ref> He ran unopposed in the 2010 general election.

Nunes's district was renumbered the 22nd after the 2010 census. It lost most of eastern Tulare County to the neighboring 23rd District, and now has a small plurality of Hispanic voters. Despite these changes, it is no less Republican than its predecessor. Nunes was reelected with 62% of the vote in 2012, 72% in 2014, and 68% in 2016.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |title=Statement of Vote, November 6, 2012, General Election |last=Bowen |first=Debra |date=November 2012 |website=California Secretary of State |publisher=State of California |access-date=January 22, 2018 |page=31}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2014-general/pdf/2014-complete-sov.pdf |title=Statement of Vote, November 4, 2014, General Election |last=Bowen |first=Debra |date=November 2014 |website=California Secretary of State |publisher=State of California |access-date=January 22, 2018 |page=7}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://elections.cdn.sos.ca.gov/sov/2016-general/sov/2016-complete-sov.pdf |title=Statement of Vote, November 8, 2016, General Election |last=Padilla |first=Alex |date=November 2016 |website=California Secretary of State |publisher=State of California |access-date=January 22, 2018 |page=6}}</ref>

====Fiscal policy====
On January 27, 2010, Nunes became an original cosponsor of H.R. 4529, [[The Path to Prosperity|Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010]], the Republican Party's budget proposal sponsored by [[Paul Ryan]].<ref>{{Cite AV media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5i9fHP7Wzo|title=A Roadmap for America's Future - Introduction Press Conference|access-date=28 March 2017|website=youtube.com|quote=|date=27 Jan 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/4529 |title=H.R.4529 - 111th Congress (2009-2010): Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010 &#124; Congress.gov &#124; Library of Congress |publisher=Congress.gov |date= |access-date=2017-03-28}}</ref>

On December 2, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 6484, the Public Employee Pension Transparency Act.<ref>[http://nunes.house.gov/_files/BILLS111hr6484ih.pdf H.R. 6484 - To amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide for reporting and disclosure by State and local public employee retirement pension plans.] December 2, 2010, as introduced. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101226112318/http://nunes.house.gov/_files/BILLS111hr6484ih.pdf|date=December 26, 2010}}</ref>

Influenced by [[David Bradford (economist)|David Bradford]], Nunes has long been a proponent of a [[consumption tax]] model.<ref name="bna.com">{{cite news |url=https://www.bna.com/nunes-bill-seen-n73014445591/|title=Nunes Bill Seen as Big Influence in Republican Tax Plan|publisher=Bloomberg BNA}}</ref> In 2016, he introduced the American Business Competitiveness Act (H.R. 4377), known as the ABC Act, a "cash-flow tax plan" featuring full expensing and a reduction of the highest rate for [[Corporate tax in the United States|federal corporate income tax]] rate to 25%.<ref name="bna.com" /> Nunes's proposal was influential among House Republicans, and had similarities to the House Republican tax plan introduced by Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] and Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Kevin Brady]] in June 2016.<ref name="bna.com" /> Conservative economist [[Douglas Holtz-Eakin]] said that Nunes had "a tremendous impact on the debate" for a non-chairman.<ref name="bna.com" />

In April 2016, Nunes voted for the Preventing IRS Abuse and Protecting Free Speech Act, a bill that would prevent the IRS from accessing the names of donors to nonprofit organizations.<ref name=twsCBS23>[http://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/04/29/koch-brothers-efforts-to-hide-nonprofit-donors-identity-steamrolls-ahead/ "Koch Brothers Push Forward Efforts To Hide Nonprofit Donors' Identities"], April 29, 2016, CBS San Francisco, Retrieved April 21, 2017, "...&nbsp;Among the Republicans on the committee who voted in favor of the bill was California’s Rep. Devin Nunes&nbsp;..."</ref> Critics of the bill, which was promoted by the [[Koch family|Koch brothers]], say IRS access to donor information is important for ensuring that foreign funds do not impact U.S. elections.<ref name=twsCBS23/>

Nunes voted in support of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].<ref name="Almukhtar122117">{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|access-date=22 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}</ref>

====Environmental policy====
In February 2014, during a [[2012–13 North American drought|drought in California]], Nunes rejected any link to [[global warming]], saying "Global warming is nonsense."<ref name="Onishi">{{cite news|last1=Onishi|first1=Norimitsu|last2=Davenport|first2=Coral|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2014/02/15/us/politics/obama-to-announce-aid-for-drought-racked-california.html|title=Obama Announces Aid for Drought-Stricken California|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=February 14, 2014|access-date=May 17, 2015}}</ref> He criticized the federal government for shutting off portions of California's system of water irrigation and storage and diverting water into a program for freshwater salmon and the delta smelt. "There was plenty of water. This has nothing to do with drought."<ref name="Onishi" /> Nunes elaborated on his beliefs in an April 2015 ''[[National Review]]'' article. At the time, California farmers were criticized for their water usage and accused of making the state's drought worse: the agriculture sector uses at least 80 percent of the state's water, often on water-intensive crops such as almonds. Nunes, a third-generation dairy farmer, challenged media criticism of the agriculture industry: "Farmers do not use 80 percent of California's water. In reality, 50 percent of the water that is captured by the state's dams, reservoirs, aqueducts, and other infrastructure is diverted for environmental causes. Farmers, in fact, use 40 percent of the water supply. Environmentalists have manufactured the 80 percent statistic by deliberately excluding environmental diversions from their calculations."<ref name="nationalreview.com" /> Nunes added that California's lack of adequate water storage facilities had only made the problem worse: "Furthermore, in many years there are additional millions of acre-feet of water that are simply flushed into the ocean due to a lack of storage capacity&nbsp;— a situation partly explained by environmental groups' opposition to new water-storage projects".<ref name="nationalreview.com" /> Returning to an argument he has made before regarding California's water storage and irrigation system, Nunes added, "The drought is a genuine problem in California, but our irrigation system was designed to withstand five years of drought."<ref name="nationalreview.com" />

On May 1, 2011, with the support of other members of the San Joaquin Valley's Republican congressional delegation, Nunes authored the [[Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act]] to stop a project designed to restore a dried-up section of the [[San Joaquin River]]. This later became the basis for another bill Nunes co-sponsored, the Sacramento-San Joaquin Valley Emergency Water Delivery Act, which passed the House of Representatives in February 2014, but was not voted on by the Senate. Nunes also co-sponsored the California Emergency Drought Relief Act, which passed the House of Representatives in December 2014 but was also not voted on by the Senate. Water restrictions have been in place to enforce the [[Endangered Species Act of 1973]] and other environmental regulations that have seen water allocations decline dramatically even in non-drought years. The result has been what Nunes terms a "man-made drought".<ref>http://www.kmjnow.com/pages/landing_news?Valley-GOP-Reps-Introduce-Water-Legislat=1&blockID=520842&feedID=806 {{dead link|date=February 2017}}</ref> Nunes wrote in ''[[National Review]]'' in April 2015, "The House of Representatives has passed three bills in the last three years that would have expanded California water supplies by rolling back damaging environmental regulations. These bills died amid opposition from Senate Democrats, Governor Brown, and President Obama."<ref name="nationalreview.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/416918/no-farmers-dont-use-80-percent-californias-water-devin-nunes|title=No, Farmers Don’t Use 80 Percent of California’s Water|author=Nunes, Devin|date=April 14, 2015|work=National Review}}</ref>

====Energy policy====
In 2006, Nunes authored the "American-Made Energy Freedom Act". In July 2008, the Republican Conference introduced the American Energy Act, which included a key Nunes proposal from the American-Made Energy Freedom Act to establish a renewable energy trust fund from revenues generated by deep ocean and Arctic coastal plain exploration and invest the monies in alternative fuels and technology.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-5890|title=American-Made Energy Freedom Act of 2006 (2006 - H.R. 5890)|publisher=}}</ref>

On July 28, 2010, Nunes introduced H.R. 5899, "A Roadmap for America's Energy Future". It accelerates the exploration and production of fossil fuel, supports the rapid development of market-based alternative energy supplies, and expands the number of nuclear reactors from the current 104 to 300 over the next 30 years.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nunes.house.gov/_files/NUNES_038_xml.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2010-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803224353/http://nunes.house.gov/_files/NUNES_038_xml.pdf |archivedate=August 3, 2010 |df= }}</ref> [[Kimberley Strassel]] of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' wrote that "It's a bill designed to produce energy, not restrict it. It returns government to the role of energy facilitator, not energy boss. It costs nothing and contains no freebies.

====Healthcare policy====

In 2009, Nunes coauthored the "Patients' Choice Act" with [[Paul Ryan]] (R-WI) in the House, and [[Tom Coburn]] (R-OK) and [[Richard Burr]] (R-NC) in the Senate. The Patient's Choice Act would establish a system of state [[Health insurance marketplace|health insurance exchanges]] and amends the Internal Revenue Code to allow a refundable tax credit for qualified health care insurance coverage. The bill also proposes to absorb Medicaid programs into the exchange system.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=111_cong_bills&docid=f:h2520ih.txt.pdf|title=FDsys - Browse Congressional Bills|author=|date=|work=gpo.gov}}</ref> The Patients' Choice Act was incorporated into the "Roadmap for America's Future Act of 2010".

====Transportation policy====
[[California State Route 99]] is a highway running north–south that branches from [[Interstate 5 in California|Interstate&nbsp;5]] at the community of [[Wheeler Ridge, California|Wheeler Ridge]] in [[Kern County, California|Kern County]] and continues northward through the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]] until it connects with Interstate&nbsp;5 again at [[Red Bluff, California|Red Bluff]] in [[Tehama County, California|Tehama County]]. In 2005, Nunes introduced H.R. 99, which designated State Route 99 as a congressional [[Intermodal Surface Transportation Efficiency Act|High Priority Corridor]]. The bill also provided federal authorization for Highway 99 to become part of the [[Interstate Highway System]]. On February 17, 2011, Nunes introduced H.R. 761, the "San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act", which would give the State of California the option to redirect federal high-speed rail funds to finance improvements to Highway 99.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-761|title=San Joaquin Valley Transportation Enhancement Act of 2011 (2011 - H.R. 761)|author=|date=|work=govtrack.us}}</ref> H.R. 761 was cosponsored by [[Jeff Denham]] (R-CA) and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] (R-CA).<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cox|first1=John|title=McCarthy backs plan to redirect bullet train money to improve Highway 99|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/economy/x1248562259/McCarthy-backs-plan-to-redirect-bullet-train-money-to-improve-Highway-99|publisher=Bakersfield.com|date=February 17, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110426115920/http://www.bakersfield.com/news/business/economy/x1248562259/McCarthy-backs-plan-to-redirect-bullet-train-money-to-improve-Highway-99|archivedate=April 26, 2011}}</ref>

====Immigration and refugees====
Nunes supported President [[Donald Trump|Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] imposing a temporary ban on entry into the United States by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, calling it "a common-sense security measure to prevent terror attacks on the homeland".<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump’s travel ban; here’s where the rest stand|date=January 29, 2017|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|work=[[The Denver Post]]|access-date=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

====Intelligence Committee====
Nunes opposed the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action]], an international agreement that [[P5+1|the U.S. and other major world powers]] negotiated with [[Iran]], under which Iran was granted partial [[Sanctions against Iran|sanctions]] relief in exchange for limits and monitoring of its [[Nuclear program of Iran|nuclear activities]].<ref>Ken Dilanian, [http://www.timesofisrael.com/house-intelligence-chair-calls-for-new-iran-assessment/ House intelligence chair calls for new Iran assessment], Associated Press (July 29, 2015).</ref><ref>Eli Lak, [https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2015-07-14/house-intelligence-chairman-deal-paves-way-for-iranian-bomb House Intelligence Chairman: Deal Paves Way for Iranian Bomb], Bloomberg (July 14, 2015).</ref>

As House Intelligence Committee chairman, Nunes oversaw the Republican-controlled committee's two-year-long investigation into the U.S. response to the [[2012 Benghazi attack]]. The committee's final report found no evidence of wrongdoing on the part of Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] or any other Obama administration officials, and concluded that the response of CIA and U.S. military to the attack on the U.S. diplomatic compound was correct.<ref name="Dilanian">Ken Dilanian, [https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/house-intelligence-committee-investigation-debunks-many-benghazi-theories/ House Intelligence Committee investigation debunks many Benghazi theories], Associated Press (November 21, 2014).</ref> The committee's report debunked "a series of persistent allegations hinting at dark conspiracies" about the attack, determining that "there was no intelligence failure, no delay in sending a CIA rescue team, no missed opportunity for a military rescue, and no evidence the CIA was covertly shipping arms from Libya to Syria", but found "that the State Department facility where [Christopher] Stevens and [Sean] Smith were killed was not well-protected, and that State Department security agents knew they could not defend it from a well-armed attack".<ref name="Dilanian" />

Paul Ryan vacated the chairmanship of the Ways and Means Committee when he replaced [[John Boehner]] as Speaker of the House of Representatives.

====Comments about other politicians====
[[File:Devin Nunes by Gage Skidmore.jpg|thumb|right|Nunes at CPAC in 2018]] 
Nunes wrote in his book that members of the environmental lobby were "followers of neo-Marxist, socialist, Maoist or Communist ideals".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/article24592231.html|title=California lawmaker's book pounds environmentalists|first=Michael Doyle-McClatchy|last=Newspapers|date=|work=mcclatchydc.com}}</ref> During the debate over President Obama's health care bill in the House of Representatives, Nunes said of then-Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]], "For most of the 20th century people fled the ghost of communist dictators and now you are bringing the ghosts back into this chamber."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=auJ4VtdAd7w|title=Healthcare Bill: The Ghost of Communism|first=|last=RepDevinNunes|date=March 21, 2010|publisher=|via=YouTube}}</ref> He has also had a long-running dispute with another San Francisco Bay area Democrat, Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]], over California water policy and other issues,<ref name=News10 /> even running a series of advertisements against her in California.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/news/ap/politics/2011/Nov/07/gop_congressman_runs_tv_ads_attacking_feinstein.html|title=GOP congressman runs TV ads attacking Feinstein|author=|date=|work=RealClearPolitics}}</ref>

Nunes's criticisms have not been limited to liberals or the Obama administration. During the October 2013 budget standoff, Nunes called certain members of his own [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Conference]] who favored a government shutdown "lemmings with suicide vests". "It's kind of an insult to lemmings to call them lemmings" because of their tactics, he said.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2013/09/30/nunes-calls-fellow-house-republicans-lemmings-with-suicide-vests/|title=Nunes calls fellow House Republicans ‘Lemmings with suicide vests’|author=|date=|work=The Washington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/01/us/politics/conservatives-with-a-cause-were-right.html|title=Conservatives With a Cause: ‘We’re Right’|first=Ashley|last=Parker|date=September 30, 2013|work=The New York Times}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/|title=Salon: in-depth news, politics, business, technology & culture|author=|date=|work=salon.com}}</ref> Nunes explained the origin of his remarks, and the climate in the House Republican Conference and floor in an interview and panel discussion on [[CNN]].<ref name=YouTube2013 />

In May 2014, Nunes came under fire when he charged that Michigan Congressman and fellow Republican [[Justin Amash]] was "[[al-Qaeda]]'s best friend in Congress" because of Amash's supposed voting record on [[National Security Agency]] (NSA) surveillance. At the time, Amash had voted in opposition to a Nunes water bill for California "on constitutional grounds".<ref>{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Anna|last2=Sherman|first2=Jake|title=Taking on a die-hard tea partier|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/establishment-tea-partier-106476.html|work=Politico|date=May 8, 2014}}</ref>

On March 22, 2017, during the House Intelligence Committee's investigation into [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]], Nunes held a press conference to announce that he had received information that communications of members of Trump's transition team had been "incidentally collected" by the intelligence community. The communications had been obtained legally during foreign intelligence surveillance, but were not related to Russia. He added that the information was "widely disseminated" in the intelligence community and later clarified that Trump associates were not necessarily participants in the intercepted conversations.
