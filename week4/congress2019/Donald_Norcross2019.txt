===Elections===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2014}}
On February 4, 2014, South Jersey Congressman [[Rob Andrews]] announced he would be resigning from Congress by the end of the month, and he did so on February 18.<ref name="robandrews">[https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/04/n-j-democrat-rob-andrews-expected-to-resign-from-congress "N.J. Democrat Rob Andrews to resign from Congress"], washingtonpost.com; accessed November 17, 2014.</ref>

Norcross announced his candidacy February 5, and within a week, he was endorsed by every New Jersey congressional Democrat, State Senate President [[Stephen Sweeney]], General Assembly Majority Leader [[Louis Greenwald]], [[Mayor of Camden, New Jersey|Mayor of Camden]] [[Dana Redd]], U.S. Senator [[Cory Booker]], and former Governor [[Jim Florio]].<ref name="phillyblogs">[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/capitolinq/Andrews-to-leave-Congress-in-Feb.html Rob Andrews to leave Congress], philly.com; accessed November 17, 2014.</ref>

===Tenure===
[[File:Women's March on New Jersey 1 21 17 - 31608724104.jpg|thumb|Norcross speaking at the [[2017 Women's March]] in Trenton, New Jersey]]
Norcross easily won the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 72 percent of the vote. He ran in two elections on November 4--a special election for the balance of Andrews' 12th full term, and a regular election for a full two-year term—winning both over Republican challenger [[Garry Cobb]]. He was sworn in on November 12, 2014 by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]]. Since he was added to the House roll on that date, he gained more seniority than other members of the House freshman class of 2014.

Soon after his election, Norcross was appointed to Assistant Whip, a role he would go on to reprise after his 2016 re-election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://norcross.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/congressman-norcross-re-appointed-democratic-leadership-position |title=Congressman Norcross Re-Appointed to Democratic Leadership Position|date=January 18, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Norcross currently serves in a number of leadership roles in the Democratic Caucus, as well, including serving as co-chair of the Rebuilding America Task Force,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://norcross.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/norcross-named-co-chair-house-democrats-jobs-america-effort|title=Norcross Named Co-Chair of House Democrats’ ‘Jobs for America’ Effort |date=September 13, 2017 |accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref> member of the Steering and Policy Committee,<ref name="house.gov">{{cite web |url=https://norcross.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/spc|title=Congressman Norcross Appointed to Democratic Leadership Committee|date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=April 3, 2018}}</ref> and member of the Communications Committee.<ref name="house.gov1">{{cite web|url=https://norcross.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-norcross-named-house-democrats-new-policy-communications-committee|title=Rep.
