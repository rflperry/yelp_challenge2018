'''Lloyd Alton Doggett II''' (born October 6, 1946) is an American attorney and politician who is a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[Texas]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he has represented a district based in the state capital and his hometown, [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], since 1995, currently numbered as [[Texas's 35th congressional district]].

Doggett received a [[bachelor's degree]] in Business Administration and a [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]].

Dogget has held office as a legislator in the [[Texas State Senate]] and the [[U.S. House of Representatives]]. He has also held office as a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]], before being elected to the U.S. House of Representatives.

==Early life, education and career==
Born in Austin, Doggett received both a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[Business Administration]] and a [[Juris Doctor]] degree from the [[University of Texas at Austin]], where he served as student body president his senior year. While attending the [[University of Texas at Austin]], he also joined [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] Fraternity.

==Texas government==
His electoral career began in 1973, when he was elected to the [[Texas State Senate]], a position which he filled until 1985.  In 1984, he was the Democratic [[nomination|nominee]] for the [[United States Senate]] seat vacated by the perennial [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], [[John Tower]], but he lost to the Republican candidate, [[Phil Gramm]]. Doggett authored the bill creating the Texas Commission on Human Rights, as well as a law outlawing "cop killer" bullets and a "sunset law" requiring periodic review of government agencies. He gained attention in 1979, as a member of the "[[Killer Bees (Texas Senate)|Killer Bees]]" â€” a group of 12 Democratic state senators who opposed a plan to move the state's presidential primary to March 11. The intent was to give former [[governor of Texas|governor]] [[John Connally]] a leg up on the 1980 Republican nomination. The Killer Bees wanted a [[closed primary]]. When this proposal was rejected, they walked out of the chamber and left the Senate two members short of a [[quorum]]. The bill was withdrawn five days later.

In 1989, he became both a justice of the [[Texas Supreme Court]] and an adjunct [[professor]] at the [[University of Texas School of Law]], his [[alma mater]], serving until his election to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Described as an "endangered species", Doggett was one of only three white Democratic House members from Texas in the 113th Congress (the others being [[Gene Green]] and [[Beto O'Rourke]]) in a state with mostly Republicans and minority members of the Democratic Party.<ref name="Politico Doggett">{{cite news|title=Is Lloyd Doggett Texas toast?|author= Alex Isenstadt|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0711/59034.html|newspaper= Politico}}</ref> He is one of the most liberal white Democrats from a Southern district, and one of the most liberal congressmen ever to represent Texas in Congress.

===Tenure===
Doggett has long supported more open government, and is also a leading advocate for campaign finance reform. On the Ways and Means Committee, he has sought to close many overseas tax shelters. Doggett has authored legislation to create tax incentives for plug-in hybrid electric vehicles and to create a nationwide Silver Alert system. From 2011 to 2016, he served as ranking member on the Human Resources Subcommittee and in 2017 became ranking on the Tax Policy Subcommittee. His priorities there have included education, health care, preventing child abuse, reducing prescription drug prices, fighting poverty, and eliminating multinational tax shelters and loopholes.

;Abortion
Doggett is pro-choice. In 2003 he voted against a bill that would have banned all [[partial-birth abortions]]. He was given a 100% by the [[NARAL]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Lloyd_Doggett_Abortion.htm|title=Lloyd Doggett on Abortion|publisher=Ontheissues.org|access-date=March 12, 2010}}</ref> He voted in favor of a bill to provide federal funding for [[embryonic stem cell research]] in 2007.

;Environment
Doggett supports environmental preservation. He is one of the leading opponents in the House of drilling for oil in the Arctic National Wildlife Reserve in Alaska. The [[League of Conservation Voters]] gives Doggett a 100 percent rating,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.massscorecard.org/TX/Lloyd_Doggett_Environment.htm|title=Lloyd Doggett on Environment|publisher=massscorecard.org|access-date=March 12, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718193631/http://www.massscorecard.org/TX/Lloyd_Doggett_Environment.htm|archive-date=July 18, 2011|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> an indication Doggett supports that group's interpretation of environmental preservation. In the 110th Congress (2007â€“08), he wrote climate change legislation that would have gone further to reduce greenhouse gases than bills supported by his party's leaders.<ref>https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/6316</ref>

In June 2009, Doggett voted in favor of the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], a bill that would have established an [[emissions trading]] system for American producers of carbon dioxide. Doggett remarked "It has been a difficult and significant decision". "I just decided that I will have a better chance to make changes later in the process if I acted in good faith now. But don't think this means I'm signing off on the conference report", Doggett added.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0609/24232.html|title=House passes climate-change bill|last=Lerer|first=Lisa|author2=Patrick O'Connor|date=2009-06-25|publisher=Capitol News Company LLC|access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref>

;Gay rights
Doggett voted against the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in the [[109th Congress]]. He voted against HR 4380 and HR 2587, bills that would have banned adoption by same-sex couples.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=21689&type=category&category=31&go.x=10&go.y=15|title=Family and Children Issues|publisher=Votesmart|access-date=12 March 2010}}</ref> In 1996, Doggett voted for the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (DOMA), but became a cosponsor of the [[Respect for Marriage Act]], which would repeal DOMA, in 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8013&can_id=21689|title=Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA)|publisher=votesmart.org|access-date=March 12, 2010}}</ref><ref>http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR01116:@@@P</ref>

;Taxes
Doggett introduced legislation focused on restricting American companies from using overseas strategies to reduce their corporate tax rates. When Obama unveiled his plan in May 2009 to significantly change how U.S.-based multinationals are taxed, it included aspects of Doggett's proposals to crack down on tax dodgers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tax-news.com/news/Obama_Announces_International_Tax_Crackdown_____36605.html|title=Obama Announces International Tax Crackdown|website=www.Tax-News.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref> He voted against the 2010 tax compromise, criticizing the renewal of the Bush tax cuts, saying "This bill is largely a mish-mash of rejected Republican ideas that cost too much to accomplish too little."<ref>{{cite news|title=Obama willing to fight the left if needed-White House|author= Alister Bull|url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2010/12/17/obama-liberals-idUSN1711629920101217|newspaper= Reuters|date=December 17, 2010}}</ref> He led a group of Democrats who "criticized the inclusion of a Social Security payroll tax reduction, saying it would endanger the soundness of the program."<ref name="Washington Post"/>

In 2010, Doggett was responsible for an amendment to an education jobs bill which would mandate Texas keeping the same amount of education funding for three years in order to receive $832 million in federal money. [[Rick Perry]] called it "an unconstitutional anti-Texas amendment" and would later file a lawsuit after the Department of Education declined the application for funds.<ref name="Washington Post"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Lisa Falkenberg: Political chess match has schools as pawns|author= [[Lisa Falkenberg (journalist)|Lisa Falkenberg]]|url=http://www.chron.com/news/falkenberg/article/Lisa-Falkenberg-Political-chess-match-has-1687551.php|newspaper= Houston Chronicle|date=April 27, 2011|access-date= }}</ref>

In 2015, Doggett introduced legislation to close a loophole that allows tax write-offs for senior executive bonuses, calling it "a perverse incentive for companies: the more you pay your executives, the less you'll pay in taxes."<ref>http://www.cq.com/doc/member-467?3, https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2103?q=%7B"search"%3A%5B"Stop+Subsidizing+Multimillion+Dollar+Corporate+Bonuses+Act"%5D%7D&r=1
http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/democrats-push-to-tax-excessive-employee-pay/article/2611587</ref>

;Energy
Doggett has backed bills with the intention of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and supporting cap-and-trade as well as clean technologies. Doggett supported the 2009 climate-change bill, "despite claiming it didn't do enough to protect the environment." He said it stripped the EPA of too much power and was too beneficial to coal plants and "other polluters." Doggett supports auctioning carbon allowances, and has worked to make legislation usually associated with the House Ways and Means Committee to be associated with the Energy and Commerce Committee.<ref name="Washington Post"/><ref>{{cite news |title= Lloyd Doggett on Energy & Oil|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Lloyd_Doggett_Energy_+_Oil.htm|newspaper=On The Issues}}</ref>

In June 2015, Doggett voted against fast-track Trade Promotion Authority, calling it a "charter for corporate America rather than a high-level trade agreement." He criticized the U.S. Trade Representative for failing to enforce labor and environmental standards. "Usually, the reason that USTR fails is that it doesn't really try," he said. 'Asleep at the Wheel' is a great Texas swing band, but it is a horrible philosophy for trade law enforcement."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?326582-1/us-house-passes-tpa-218208|title=US House Passes TPA 218-208, Jun 18 2015 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

In 2015, his continued interest in international affairs was reflected in his leadership supporting the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA), the Iran nuclear deal. Together with Congressman David Price and Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky, Doggett organized a successful whip effort to ensure Congress did not obstruct nuclear negotiations with Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/07/house-democrats-whip-iran-deal-120642|title=House Dems whip for Iran deal|website=Politico.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/05/07/the-odds-of-an-iran-nuclear-deal-just-got-higher/|title=The odds of an Iran nuclear deal just got better|first=|last=https://www.facebook.com/GregSargentWP|website=Washington Post|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

;Healthcare
In March 2010, Doggett voted in favor of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. Prior to his vote, Doggett cited concerns with the bill not including enough affordability, insurance competition provisions, and consumer protection provisions. Originally an advocate of a public option, he conceded the option in the final vote.<ref name="Washington Post"/>

In 2015, Congress passed Rep. Doggett's NOTICE Act, which ensures that hospitalized seniors are notified whether they are in outpatient observation or inpatient care, saving them the sticker shock from realizing Medicare may not cover their skilled nursing facility care as expected. Doggett sponsored the Medicare Identity Theft Prevention Act, which was enacted into law in 2015 and which protects seniors from identity theft by removing Social Security numbers from Medicare cards. Another of Doggett's sponsored bills, the Ensuring Access to Clinical Trials Act, was enacted that same year. This legislation allows patients with rare disease to receive some compensation for clinical trial participation, without that compensation counting toward income eligibility limits for Social Security income or Medicaid.<ref>https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/876?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22notice+act+lloyd+doggett%22%5D%7D&r=1</ref>

Doggett says the same Republicans in Congress and "ideological groups that have never accepted the idea of social insurance" pose a greater threat to Social Security than the country's aging population.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CHRG-114hhrg21288/html/CHRG-114hhrg21288.htm|title=- MAINTAINING THE DISABILITY INSURANCE TRUST FUND'S SOLVENCY|website=www.GPO.gov|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

Doggett founded the House Prescription Drug Task Force to tackle the skyrocketing cost of prescription drugs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.expressnews.com/news/local/article/S-A-congressman-investigating-prescription-costs-6679975.php|title=S.A. congressman investigating prescription costs|website=ExpressNews.com|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

;Criticism of healthcare opponents
In August 2009 a "rally" against the health care plans broke out after Doggett said that he would support the bill even if his constituents were opposed to the legislation. The protesters, who chanted "just say no", were later criticized by Doggett, who called them a "mob" and "extremists", and said the group was part of the "party of no."<ref>{{cite news|title=Interview with Rep. Lloyd Doggett|author=Situation Room|url=http://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2009/08/06/interview_with_rep_lloyd_doggett_97818.html|newspaper=Real Clear Politics|date=August 6, 2009}}</ref> Of the situation, he said: "Their fanatical insistence on repealing Social Security and Medicare is not just about halting health care reform but rolling back 75 years of progress." Doggett stated that he was committed to individual choices.

Doggett reportedly tried to answer questions, but felt the demonstrators opposed all government programs, including Social Security and Medicare, in addition to the health care plan. He said that "[i]n Texas, not only with the weather but with the politics, it is pretty hardball around here ... I have a pretty thick skin about all of this. But this really goes over the line.'"<ref>{{cite news |title= Health Plan Opponents Make Voices Heard|author=David M.

;Immigration
Doggett supports a guest worker program for [[illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigrants]]. In 2004, he voted against a bill that would have required hospitals to report illegal immigrants who received hospital treatment to the U.S. Department of Justice. The [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] gave him a score of 0% in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Lloyd_Doggett_Immigration.htm|title=Lloyd Doggett on Immigration|publisher=OnTheIssues.org|access-date= March 12, 2010}}</ref>

Doggett also supports the Obama Administration's [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] (DACA) program, which grants undocumented immigrants brought to the United States at a young age, known as "Dreamers", access to work permits and deportation relief.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doggett.house.gov/issues/immigration-reform|title=Immigration Reform|website=House.gov|access-date=November 2, 2017}}</ref>

;Iraq
Doggett was one of the leading opponents of the authorization of the [[Iraq War]] in 2003 and called for a timetable for U.S. troops pulling out of Iraq. On May 24, 2007, Doggett was one of 140 Democrats and 2 Republicans to vote against HR 2206, a bill that would provide emergency supplemental appropriations for funding the war, and in 2009 he was one of only 30 Representatives to vote against HR 2346 which provided funding to continue war.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/story/140715/shame%3A_the_%27anti-war%27_democrats_who_sold_out/|title=Shame: The 'Anti-War' Democrats Who Sold Out|last=Scahill|first=Jeremy|date=2009-06-17|publisher=Alternet|access-date=March 12, 2010}}</ref>

;Education
In 2009, as part of the Obama Administration's American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, Doggett authored the American Opportunity Tax Credit, which provides a refundable credit for some tuition and related expenses.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://doggett.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-doggett-introduces-permanent-extension-american-opportunity-tax|title=Rep.

;Other social service issues
Rep. Doggett passed a bill into law in January 2013 setting up a national commission to examine ways to reduce the number of children who die from abuse and neglect.<ref>https://www.congress.gov/bill/112th-congress/house-bill/6655?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22protect+our+kids+act+lloyd+doggett%22%5D%7D&r=1</ref> More children die in Texas from abuse and neglect than in any other state.<ref>https://www.acf.hhs.gov/sites/default/files/cb/cm2015.pdf</ref> The tax and spending deal approved that month to avoid a so-called "fiscal cliff" included an extension of a higher-education tax credit he had proposed.

==Political campaigns==
;Before 2012
In [[United States Senate election in Texas, 1984|1984]] he lost the U.S. Senate election to then U.S. Representative Phil Gramm by a margin of 59 to 41 percent. He was elected to the House of Representatives in [[U.S. House election, 1994|1994]] in what was then the [[Texas's 10th congressional district|10th District]] after 32-year incumbent [[Jake Pickle]] retired.  He was one of the few Democrats to win an open seat in that year's massive Republican landslide. Running for re-election in [[U.S. House election, 1996|1996]], Congressman Doggett defeated a challenger in [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] Teresa Doggett, to whom he is no relation. It marked the second election in a row in which he defeated a black female Republican. In the years following his first re-election, Doggett would consistently win around 85% of the vote, facing only [[United States Libertarian Party|Libertarian]] opponents. The 10th, which had once been represented by [[Lyndon Johnson]], had long been a liberal Democratic bastion in increasingly Republican Texas.

[[2003 Texas redistricting|Redistricting by the Texas Legislature]] in 2003 split Austin, which had been located entirely or almost entirely in the 10th district for more than a century, among three districts.  Through Republican [[gerrymandering]], Doggett's home wound up in a new, heavily Republican 10th district stretching from north central Austin to the [[Houston]] suburbs.  Most of Doggett's former territory wound up on the 25th district, which consisted of a long tendril stretching from Austin to [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. It was called "the [[fajita]] strip" or "the [[bacon]] strip" because of its shape. Doggett moved to the newly configured 25th and entered the Democratic primaryâ€”the real contest in the heavily Democratic, majority-Hispanic district. He won the primary and went on to victory in November. {{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

On June 28, 2006, the [[United States Supreme Court]] ruled that the nearby 23rd District's lines violated the rights of Latino voters.  As part of the 2003 redistricting, heavily Democratic and majority-Latino [[Laredo, Texas|Laredo]] had largely been cut out of the 23rd and replaced by several heavily Republican areas near San Antonio. The decision turned on the fact that the 23rd was a protected majority-Latino districtâ€”in other words, if the 23rd was ever redrawn to put Latinos in a minority, an acceptable majority-Latino district had to be created in its place.  While the new 23rd was 55% Latino, only 46% of its voting population was Latino. The Court therefore found that the 23rd was not an acceptable Latino-majority district. It also found that the 25th was not compact enough to be an acceptable replacement because the two Latino communities in the district were more than 300 miles apart, creating the impression that it had been deliberately drawn to pick up as many Latinos as possible without regard to compactness.<ref name="Decision in LULAC v. Perry">{{cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/html/05-204.ZO.html|title=Decision in LULAC v. Perry|access-date=March 10, 2010|work=Cornell University Law School}}, which forced the redrawing of the 25th</ref>

Due to the size of the 23rd, the ruling forced the redrawing of five districts between [[El Paso]] and San Antonio, including the 25th. For the 2006 election, Doggett regained most of his old base in Austin (though not the area around the [[University of Texas at Austin]], which stayed in the 21st), and also picked up several suburbs southeast of the city.  After skating to reelection in 2006 and 2008, he was held to only 52 percent of the vote in 2010â€”his closest race since 1996.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2012#District 35}}
It was reported that the new Congressional maps in Texas turned Doggett's district from a strongly Democratic district into a strongly Republican one.<ref>{{cite news |title= The GOP's big Texas gerrymander|author= Aaron Blake|url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-gops-strong-texas-gerrymander/2011/06/02/AGP56VHH_blog.html|newspaper= Washington Post|access-date=June 2, 2011|date=June 2, 2011}}</ref>  The new map split Doggett's old territory among five districts. His home was placed in a new, heavily Republican 25th District stretching from east Austin all the way to the fringes of Fort Worth.  Much of his old base, however, was placed in the newly created 35th district, a majority-Hispanic district stretching from San Antonio to eastern Austin.<ref>[ftp://ftpgis1.tlc.state.tx.us/PlanC235/Maps/Individual%20Districts/map_C235_25-36.pdf Map of Texas Congressional districts 25-36]</ref> Doggett's home was located approximately five blocks east of the 35th. It appeared that the Republican-controlled state legislature had [[gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] the district by packing as many Democrats in the San Antonio-Austin corridor into it as possible.<ref name=AC/>

Doggett accused the Republicans of wanting to make it difficult, if not impossible, for an Anglo Democrat to be elected to Congress from Texas, saying, "The Republican Party is determined to make the Democratic Party a party of minorities â€” that is what this is about, as well."  He added that the Republicans were deliberately trying to reduce Austin's clout in Congress by "deny(ing) the capital city an opportunity to have a district that reflects the capital city." He was faced with the choice between running in the reconfigured 25th or moving, joking that he would live in a Winnebago to be able to run in the newly created 35th.<ref>{{cite news |title= Doggett: Texas GOP's redistricting plan aims to eliminate white Dems|author=Sean Miller|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/redistricting/165959-doggett-texas-gops-redistricting-plan-aims-to-eliminate-white-dems|newspaper=The Hill}}</ref>

Doggett was set to face State Representative [[Joaquin Castro]] in the District 35 primary election. The potential race was described as the biggest threat to Doggett's survival yet, with Castro being seen as a "rising star" in the Democratic party. Doggett accused Castro of working alongside Republicans throughout the redistricting process. The Republican House Redistricting Committee later clarified, saying that any discussions with Castro took place after the area for the district was decided.<ref>{{cite news|title=Doggett vs. Castro: Getting Ugly Already|author=Cindy Casares|url=http://www.texasobserver.org/big-beat/doggett-vs-castro-getting-ugly-already|newspaper= Texas Observer}}</ref> However, Castro opted to run in the neighboring 20th District after its incumbent, [[Charlie Gonzalez]], announced his retirement.

Doggett eventually decided to run in the 35th District, facing [[Bexar County]] assessor [[Sylvia Romo]]. Before the primaries, he said that he would move into the district if he were to win. Political commentators suggested that Romo had the district numbers in her favor, but was attempting the difficult leap from local office to Congress, while Doggett had a huge amount of funding. Doggett has stressed his long tenure as a progressive Democrat, saying he wants to "stoutly defend Social Security, Medicare, and national health care, and also notes his strong support for both higher education programs and public education." By contrast, Romo's campaign stressed her tax knowledge and CPA license, focusing on her potential to help with Congressional tax reform and economic growth.<ref name=AC>{{cite news|title= CD 35: Doggett, Romo, Alvarado|author=Michael King|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-05-11/cd-35-doggett-romo-alvarado|newspaper=Austin Chronicle}}</ref>

Doggett won the primary with 73.2% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title= Election 2012: The Morning After cheat sheet|author=Brad Rollins|url=http://smmercury.com/2012/05/30/election-2012-the-morning-after-cheat-sheet|newspaper=San Marcos Mercury}}</ref> He performed strongly in San Antonio, an area he had never before represented. The district is so heavily Democratic that he was heavily favored to win the general election in November.<ref name='Doggett beats rivals favored to win in November'>{{cite news|url=http://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/article/Doggett-beats-rivals-favored-to-win-in-November-3594032.php|title=Doggett beats rivals favored to win in November|first=Gary|last=Martin|newspaper=[[Houston Chronicle]]|access-date=May 30, 2012}}</ref>  He easily defeated Republican challenger [[Susan Narvaiz]] in the general election to become the first Anglo Democrat to represent a significant portion of San Antonio since [[Chick Kazen]] left office in 1985.

;2016
Doggett won his twelfth term in the U.S. House in the general election held on November 8, 2016. With 124,612 votes (63.1 percent), he defeated the Republican Susan Griffith Narvaiz (born 1957) of [[San Marcos, Texas|San Marcos]], who polled 62,384 ballots (31.6 percent). Two other contenders held the remaining 5.4 percent of the ballots cast.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist319_state.htm|title=Election Results|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|access-date=December 17, 2016}}</ref>

In April 2008 while celebrating the upcoming [[Earth Day]] Doggett fell off of his bicycle and broke his leg.
