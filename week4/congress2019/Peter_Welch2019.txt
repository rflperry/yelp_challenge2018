'''Peter Francis Welch''' (born May 2, 1947) is an American politician serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|VT|AL}} since 2007. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] and has been a major figure in Vermont politics for over three decades.

He previously served in the [[Vermont Senate]] from 1981 to 1989, where he had spells as the Minority Leader and President pro tempore. In 1988, he gave up his seat to run for the United States House of Representatives, losing in the Democratic primary to House Majority Leader, [[Paul N. Poirier]]. He was the Democratic nominee for [[Governor of Vermont]] in [[Vermont gubernatorial election, 1990|1990]], losing to former Republican Governor [[Richard A. Snelling]] 52% to 46%.

He returned to politics in 2001, when he was appointed back to the Vermont Senate. He was reelected in 2002 and 2004 before making a successful run for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2006 to replace independent [[Bernie Sanders]], who was [[United States Senate election in Vermont, 2006|elected]] to the [[United States Senate]].

==Early life, education and career==
Welch was born in [[Springfield, Massachusetts]] in 1947, where he attended local [[Catholic school]]s (Holy Name Grammar School and [[Cathedral High School (Springfield, Massachusetts)|Cathedral High School]]). He graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[College of the Holy Cross]] in 1969 and in 1973 earned a [[law degree]] from [[Boalt Hall]], the [[law school]] of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].<ref name=Boalt2006>{{cite web|url=http://www.law.berkeley.edu/news/2006/welch110906.html |title=Peter Welch '73 Elected to Congress from Vermont |accessdate=October 6, 2008 |date=November 9, 2006 |month= |work=BerkeleyLaw |publisher=The Regents of the University of California |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080708195656/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/news/2006/welch110906.html |archivedate=July 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes }}</ref>

He was a partner for 30 years in the [[personal injury]] [[law firm]] Welch, Graham & Manby in [[White River Junction, Vermont]].<ref name=Boalt2006/> Welch's legal career is the basis for the legal adventures of one of the lead characters in [[Jacob M. Appel]]'s satiric novel, ''[[The Man Who Wouldn't Stand Up]]'' (2012).<ref>Appel, JM.  ''Phoning Home'' University of South Carolina Press, 2014</ref>

Welch is married to Margaret Cheney, a former member of the [[Vermont House of Representatives]] who was appointed to the [[Vermont Public Service Board]] in 2013.<ref>Office of the Governor of Vermont, [http://governor.vermont.gov/newsroom-gov-shumlin-appoints-margaret-cheney-to-psb Press Release: Gov.

Welch has five stepchildren from his first marriage and now has three stepchildren in his second.

==Vermont government==
In 1980, Welch was elected to the [[Vermont Senate]] as a representative from [[Windsor County]]. In his second term, Welch was chosen as the [[Minority Leader]], and was chosen as [[President pro tempore of the Vermont State Senate|President pro tempore]] after Democrats gained control of the Senate.<ref name=Boalt2006/>  Welch was the first Democrat to serve as Vermont's Senate President, since Vermont was a bastion for the [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and then the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] for more than 100 years beginning in the 1830s.<ref>New York Times, [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/11/07/us/the-1990-elections-state-by-state-northeast.html?pagewanted=3&src=pm The 1990 Elections: State By State; Northeast], November 7, 1990</ref>

In 1988, Welch left the Vermont Senate to make an unsuccessful run for the Democratic nomination for a seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] to represent [[Vermont's at-large congressional district]].

In 1990, Welch won the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of Vermont]], but lost [[Vermont gubernatorial election, 1990|in the general election]] to Republican [[Richard Snelling]].<ref name=Boalt2006/>

Welch did not run for another office for more than a decade; in 2001 he was appointed by Governor [[Howard Dean]] to fill a vacant Vermont Senate seat in Windsor County. He was elected to the seat in 2002 and reelected in 2004, again serving as president ''pro tempore.''<ref name=Boalt2006/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

{{See also|United States House of Representatives election in Vermont, 2006}}
When Vermont's lone U.S. House member, [[Bernie Sanders]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] in 2006, Welch chose to run for Sanders' seat. He defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Martha Rainville]] in the November 7, 2006 general election 53% to 45% in a race where both candidates pledged to be entirely positive.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/printer_friendly_wires/2006Nov02/0,4675,CleanCampaign,00.html | work=Fox News | title=No Mud Flung in Race for House in Vt}}</ref>  Welch was technically the first Democrat to represent Vermont in the House since 1961, and only the second since 1853 (though Sanders caucused with the Democrats).

Welch was re-elected in 2008 with no major-party opposition, becoming the first Democrat to be reelected to the House from Vermont in 158 years.  He was in the unusual position of being both the Democratic and Republican nominee for the seat, due to Republican voters writing his name in on the blank primary ballot.<ref name="VT Times Agnus">{{cite web|title=Write-ins give Welch GOP nomination|date=September 18, 2008|url=http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080918/NEWS02/809180364|publisher=The Barre Montpelier Times Agnus|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103104420/http://www.timesargus.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20080918%2FNEWS02%2F809180364|archivedate=November 3, 2012|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

He defeated Liberty Union candidate Erica Clawson in the general election with 90% of the vote to Erica's 10%.<ref>https://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/house</ref>

===Tenure===
Welch worked with former Republican House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] on a bill to increase funding at the [[National Institutes of Health]] for pediatric research and with Republican Congressman [[Paul Ryan]] to reverse proposed regulations that would have banned the use of wooden shelves for ageing cheese wheels. He touts his bipartisanship and describes himself as "very independent." He bucked his party leadership by voting against [[American-led intervention in Syria|arming and training Syrian rebels]] and opposes "boots on the ground" in dealing with [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]]. He believes climate change is a "glaring problem," opposes travel bans in response to the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa|Ebola epidemic]] and supports immigration reform that addresses border concerns but does not close them.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2014/10/26/republican-donka-tries-unseat-welch/17858879/ |title=Republican Donka tries again to unseat Welch |publisher=The Burlington Free Press |date=October 26, 2014 |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

===Sponsored legislation===

===Key votes===
Welch voted no on {{USBill|110|hr|3997}}, the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008: "The economic crisis we face is real.

He later voted in favor of a new version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act numbered {{USBill|110|hr|1424}}.

==Political positions==
As of September 2007, Welch's [http://welch.house.gov congressional website] depicted his stand on issues and legislation, as follows:
* Developing a "pro-Vermont family farm 2007 farm bill and advocating for other federal policies that strengthen Vermont agriculture."
* Ending the War in Iraq. Welch opposed the war before it began.
* Caring for veterans by including the support of their recovery from the effects of war in the military budget.
* Combating global warming and increasing energy independence.
* Providing universal health care and affordable prescription drugs to Americans.

One website that tracks congressional votes, [http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Peter_Welch.htm Ontheissues.org], reported in September 2007 that Welch believes that an abortion decision should be between a woman and her doctor. His [https://web.archive.org/web/20070818043301/http://www.welchforcongress.com/sportingoutdoors campaign website] for 2006 claimed that he had a "100 percent National [Rifle] Association record."

In his first term, Welch attracted attention for his partnership with Senator [[Charles Grassley]] (R-IA) in challenging colleges and universities with enormous endowments to spend more of those funds for operating expenses (including, perhaps, lower tuition).<ref>[http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/25616 Yale Daily News - Endowment spending may be mandated] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009140820/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/25616 |date=October 9, 2008 }}</ref>

===Impeachment controversy===
One area where Welch has been at odds with vocal constituents is the matter of impeachment of [[George W. Bush|President Bush]] and [[Dick Cheney|Vice President Cheney]]. Welch has expressed the opinion that ending the [[Iraq War]] is a top priority, and impeachment would distract the Congress from addressing that outcome. Advocates of impeachment protested in Welch's Vermont offices.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vermontguardian.com/local/032007/WelchProtest.shtml |title=Protestors camp out in Welch's congressional office |publisher=Vermontguardian.com |date=March 20, 2007 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

On the Iraq War, the ''Vermont Guardian''<ref name="Vermont Guardian">[http://www.vermontguardian.com/local/042007/WelchImpeach.shtml Vermont Guardian]</ref> quoted Welch as saying "if we are going to end the war we are going to have to move beyond the 218 votes", meaning 216 Democrats and 2 Republicans, who voted for a war funding bill that included a withdrawal timetable. "There is united Democratic opposition to the war and only two Republicans voted for accountability, no blank check, and a timetable. There are some folks who believe impeachment is a way to end the war, but my major reservation is that impeachment is one approach guaranteed to solidify Republican opposition."

On impeachment, the ''Vermont Guardian''<ref name="Vermont Guardian"/> quoted Welch as saying "my hat is off to the citizen activists in Vermont for bringing their case to the legislature; they are representative of the proud tradition we have in Vermont to speaking out. [...] People are expressing broad outrage about this President's handling of the war, his treatment of civil liberties, and the use of bogus intelligence, and there is a lot of common ground here on holding the President and Vice President accountable. The major question is the best way to make that happen. My fundamental concern is ending this war."

Welch endorsed then-U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] for the Democratic Party nomination in 2008.

===Domestic issues===
Welch supports a progressive Democratic position on most issues, as evidenced by his high ratings by progressive interest groups and low ratings by conservative ones.<ref name="votesmart1">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=51272 |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Peter F. Welch - Interest Group Ratings |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=May 14, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

On the issue of abortion, Welch was given a 100% rating from Planned Parenthood and NARAL Pro-Choice America. However, the National Right to Life Committee gave him a rating of 0.<ref name="votesmart1"/> Welch voted no on the November 7, 2009 amendment to President Obama's health care bill that prohibited federally funded abortions.<ref name="votesmart2">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=51272 |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Peter F. Welch - Voting Record |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=July 30, 2010 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> On the issue of gay rights, PFLAG and the Human Rights campaign rated Welch as 100% supportive of their position.<ref name="votesmart1"/> Welch has sustained a liberal stance on the issues of abortion and gay rights despite his identification as a Roman Catholic.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://congress.org/congressorg/bio/id/48818 |title=Bio : Rep. Peter Welch (D-Vermont) biography |publisher=Congress.org |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref>

Several organizations such as Americans for Fair Taxation and the National Taxpayers Union gave Welch 0 percent or F ratings. Though these organizations state they are nonpartisan, their pressure for a flatter tax rate has garnered them support from mostly Republican politicians.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=4410 |title=Project Vote Smart - National Taxpayers Union Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> Welch also voted no on the 2009-2010 Defense Spending Appropriations bill.<ref name="votesmart2"/>

Despite Welch's Progressive positions on social issues and his low ratings from traditionally conservative interest groups, Welch has adopted a conservative position on gun rights. Welch supported a bill to allow loaded guns in National Parks as well as a bill to repeal part of the DC firearms ban.<ref name="votesmart2"/> He received an A from the National Rifle Association, while the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence gave him 0 percent.<ref name="votesmart1"/>

Welch stresses the importance of veterans' support on his website and in his voting record. In July 2009, Welch supported legislation to help disabled veterans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=492 |title=Caring For Our Veterans |publisher=Welch.house.gov |date= |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> He also frequently introduces and supports legislation to help Vermont veterans, such as the April 2009 resolution to honor Captain Richard Phillips, a navy captain from Underhill Vermont, who was kidnapped by Somali pirates but returned safely.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=461&Itemid=1 |title=House passes Welch-authored resolution honoring Captain Richard Phillips and the U.S. Navy |publisher=Welch.house.gov |date=April 22, 2009 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> Welch also received an "A" rating from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America organization.<ref name="votesmart1"/>

In addition, on his website, Peter Welch states he believes in affordable access to quality health care as a fundamental right. Three key principles he strives for in health care are that everyone should be covered, everyone should contribute based upon their ability, and coverage should be independent of employers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://welch.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=490&Itemid=18|title=Providing Health Care For All |publisher=Welch.house.gov |date= |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>

According to Representative Welch's May 5, 2010 entry on the Hill's Congress Blog,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/energy-a-environment/96197-energy-efficiency-means-more-jobs-rep-peter-welch |title=Energy efficiency means more jobs |publisher=thehill.com |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref> he believes in the importance in energy efficiency. Welch said he supports putting effort into creating energy efficiency and alternative energy sources, which will create more jobs for those in need and will also greatly reduce the cost of energy bills, among other things.

As of late, Welch has been pushing for Congress to pass legislation allowing Vermont to receive federal funding to repair highways and roads damaged by Tropical Storm Irene. He has joined a coalition of 50 Democratic and Republican House members from states affected by Irene in order to make his case in Congress. He has advocated for the Republicans and Democrats to work together on many of the key issues plaguing our country today.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/public-statement/649186/vpr-welch-is-hopeful-irene-repair-money-will |title=VPR "Welch Is Hopeful Irene Repair Money Will Be Approved" - Transcript |publisher=votesmart.org |date=November 3, 2011 |accessdate=November 20, 2011}}</ref>

On February 19, 2016, Welch endorsed [[Bernie Sanders]] for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2016|Democratic Party nomination]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.burlingtonfreepress.com/story/news/politics/2016/02/19/rep-peter-welch-supports-bernie-sanders/80614844/ |title=Rep.
