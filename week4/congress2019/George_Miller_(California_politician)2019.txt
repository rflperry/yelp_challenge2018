After redistricting, Miller's district was redrawn and renumbered the 11th.

In a 2012 campaign ad, Miller said that the main challenge the U.S. faces is the need “to correct the disparities that exist in our country.”<ref name="Reignite the American Dream">{{cite web |title=Rep.

Fuller has spoken of her inspiration to run against Miller: "We are going deeper and deeper into a debt our children will never be able to pay." Democratic primary challenger John Fitzgerald, for his part, said that “people like us” need to run for Congress because D.C. pols are no longer in touch with the world.<ref name="CCT 2012 Election">{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/news/ci_20049993/barnidge-they-dream-ending-millers-38-years-congress|title=Barnidge: They dream of ending Miller’s 38 years in Congress|date=26 February 2012|website=Contracostatimes.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>

===Tenure===
[[File:U.S. Representative George Miller, 2014.jpg|thumb|Miller at the LBJ Presidential Library in 2014]]
According to the [[National Journal]], Miller is one of seven members of the House of Representatives who tie for most liberal.<ref name="Top Ten Liberal">{{cite web|title=Top Ten Liberal Representatives |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/most-liberal-members-of-congress-20110226?mrefid=site_search&page=1 |publisher=The National Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004222414/http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/most-liberal-members-of-congress-20110226?mrefid=site_search&page=1 |archivedate=2013-10-04 |df= }}</ref>

In 2011-12, Miller sponsored 10 bills (placing him at #40 out of 440 House members), none of which were made into law (ranks 18 of 440). He co-sponsored 199 bills (placing him at #138 out of 440), 4 of which were made Into law (ranks 17 of 440).<ref name="Miller Open Congress">{{cite web|title=Rep.

During Miller's 1974 campaign, he routinely disclosed his donors and expenses, taking advantage of the [[Watergate scandal]] that was still in the minds of voters. This helped get him a seat in the House at the age of 29, becoming one of the [[Watergate Babies]]. Miller is one of the three remaining Congressmen elected in the class following the Watergate scandal - the others are [[Henry Waxman]] and [[Rick Nolan]] - and has spent over half of his life in Congress.<ref name="Path to Power">{{cite news|title=Miller Path to Power|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/george-miller-d-calif/gIQA38Ad9O_topic.html#path-to-power|publisher=Washington Post | date=February 8, 2013}}</ref> One of the 10 most senior members of Congress, Miller has been described as someone who has "proven himself both a liberal lion ...and savvy about working both sides of the aisle.”<ref name="Liberal Ally"/>

With his father being the former chairman of the state Senate Finance Committee and mentor Phillip Burton being an integral part of liberal politics in the 1970s, Miller has been described as the “heir to a tradition of Bay Area working-class politics.” Miller has one of the most liberal voting records in the House, and brings "a zest for political combat." A review of Miller's career states that, although he has been unsuccessful in his pursuit of top party positions, he has "learned a legislator’s virtues of patience, timing, and creativity."<ref name="George MIller NJ">{{cite web|title=NJ Almanac George Miller |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/george-miller-ca/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120825231549/http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/george-miller-ca/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-08-25 |publisher=National Journal }}</ref>

Miller has focused on [[pension]] issues, reinstating [[Davis-Bacon Act]] wage protections for [[Gulf Coast of the United States|Gulf Coast]] workers in the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]]. In addition, Miller has worked on education issues such as protesting student aid cuts,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/11/27/MNGDSFTI2B1.DTL&feed=rss.news | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Lois | last=Romano | title=Groups gird to battle Congress' proposed student aid cuts | date=August 28, 2010}}</ref> increasing [[No Child Left Behind Act]] funding, and investigating the [[George W.

For the most part, Miller's efforts failed, and fewer than four of the sailors convicted of mutiny are still alive. However, in 1999,  [[President]] [[Bill Clinton]] pardoned [[Freddie Meeks]], one of the 50 mutineers.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cccoe.k12.ca.us/pc/the_pardon.htm|title=Port Chicago Disaster - The Pardon<!-- Bot generated title -->|website=Cccoe.k12.ca.us|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref> In addition, Miller wrote the legislation to designate the site of the event as a National Memorial.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/georgemiller/ptchicmain.html Congressman Miller's Port Chicago Page<!-- Bot generated title -->] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060130204540/http://www.house.gov/georgemiller/ptchicmain.html |date=2006-01-30 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cr.nps.gov/nr/travel/wwIIbayarea/por.htm|title=Port Chicago Naval Magazine National Memorial: World War II in the San Francisco Bay Area: A National Register of Historic Places Travel Itinerary|website=Cr.nps.gov|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>

;Native American gaming
Miller was a supporter of [[Native American gaming]]. In 2000, as ranking member of the House Resource Committee, Miller inserted an amendment to the Omnibus Indian Advancement Act that took an existing cardroom into federal trust for the [[Lytton Band of Pomo Indians]]. The amendment made the land acquisition retroactive to 1987, stating that "[s]uch land shall be deemed to have been held in trust and part of the reservation of the Rancheria prior to October 17, 1988."<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ568.106 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2006-02-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051015105814/http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=106_cong_public_laws |archive-date=2005-10-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref> This allowed the Lyttons to open a casino at the cardroom under the terms of the [[Indian Gaming Regulatory Act]] of 1988.

Miller cited Obama's [[grassroots fundraising]] campaign, first-place win in the [[Iowa caucuses|Iowa caucus]] and strong showing in the [[New Hampshire primary]], leadership style and opposition to the [[Iraq War]] as reasons for his endorsement. The endorsement was first reported in the ''Contra Costa Times'' on January 9, 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.contracostatimes.com/ci_7924179?source=most_emailed&nclick_check=1|title=George Miller endorses Obama|date=9 January 2008|website=Contracostatimes.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}</ref>

;Relationship with Nancy Pelosi
Miller has been considered [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s most trusted confidant, with conservative columnist [[Robert Novak]] describing him as "her consigliere, always at her side."<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last1=Barone |first1=Chuck |last2=McCutcheon|first2=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref> Pelosi receives advice from Miller as well as protection from potential adversaries in the Democratic Caucus.

Pelosi also named Miller chairman of the [[Steering and Policy Committees of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Policy Committee]], where he had an influential role in preparing the "New Direction" for the 2006 election.<ref name="George MIller NJ"/>

Their friendship has spanned "over 30 years and many plane trips to Washington from their neighboring California districts," with some colleagues saying that they have become so close that they finish each other's sentences. The New York Times reported that "In the concerns of some Democrats — and the I-told-you-so’s of some Republicans — Mr. Miller represents Mrs. Pelosi’s true liberal soul.”<ref name="Liberal Ally">{{cite news|last=Zernike|first=Kate|title=Pelosi’s Ascendancy in House Puts a Close Liberal Ally in the Spotlight|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/11/25/us/politics/25miller.html?_r=2|newspaper=The New York Times|date=25 November 2006}}</ref>

It was reported that by April 2012, the company's stock had fallen nearly 50% since the loan had been awarded. SunPower has paid Miller's son and his lobbying firm US$138,000 to represent them. Miller asserts that he and his son never discusses legislation; his son, however, does boast of political connections in Washington openly.<ref name="Hot water"/>
