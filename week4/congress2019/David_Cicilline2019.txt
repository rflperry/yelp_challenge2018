He remained in [[Washington, D.C.]], for a while to work as a lawyer at the [[Public Defender Service for the District of Columbia]].

He ran for the [[Rhode Island Senate]] in 1992 against incumbent senator [[Rhoda Perry]] but lost the Democratic primary.

A Brown University survey in September 2007 found that 64 percent of state residents approved of the job Cicilline was doing in Providence. By February 2008, that number had dropped to 51 percent. And in September 2008, his popularity fell to 46 percent.<ref>{{cite news|author=Marcelo, Philip |title='Providence Mayor Cicilline's approval rating sinks' |url=http://politicsblog.projo.com/2009/02/providence-mayo-1.html |work=The Providence Journal |date=2009-02-19 |accessdate=2009-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715122149/http://politicsblog.projo.com/2009/02/providence-mayo-1.html |archivedate=2011-07-15 |df= }}</ref>

===Affiliations===
Cicilline was 2008 President of the [[National Conference of Democratic Mayors]]. As mayor, he was a member of the [[Mayors Against Illegal Guns Coalition]],<ref>{{cite web
|url=http://www.mayorsagainstillegalguns.org/html/about/members.shtm|title=Coalition Members|publisher=Mayors Against Illegal Guns|accessdate=2007-09-21

The Coalition was co-chaired by [[Boston]] Mayor [[Thomas Menino]] and [[New York City]] Mayor [[Michael Bloomberg]].

In 2009, Cicilline served as one of six selection committee members for the [[Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://brunerfoundation.org/rba/index.php?page=committees&sidebar=1 |title=Rudy Bruner Award for Urban Excellence |publisher=Brunerfoundation.org |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}</ref>

===Mayoral policies===
Cicilline's administration focused on the residential neighborhoods of Providence, as well as the "Renaissance" areas of downtown and [[Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|Federal Hill]] that thrived under Cianci, and continued the promotion of the city via the tax breaks given to artists and movie productions. A former state legislator, he overcame the animosity between state and city government that had existed under Cianci.

In May 2009, Cicilline gained national headlines after proposing a $150 per semester Head Tax on each of the 25,000 college students attending four universities in the city. The tax was an effort to close $6 to $8 million of a reported $17 million city budget shortfall. The Associated Press reported that if enacted, it would become the first-in-the-nation tax on students simply for being enrolled and attending college within the city limits.<ref>[https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090513/ap_on_re_us/us_taxing_college_students ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090521001000/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20090513/ap_on_re_us/us_taxing_college_students |date=May 21, 2009 }}</ref>

Cicilline has expressed concern about the [[Providence metropolitan area]]'s [[carbon footprint]]. As mayor, he sought to implement a [[streetcar]]/[[light rail]]-type system for the city. He also focused efforts to fight poverty. He won passage of a vacant-and-abandoned property penalty, to provide an economic disincentive for banks to keep properties off the housing market for extended periods of time. He also proposed municipal bonds for the purpose of buying foreclosed properties to expand housing.{{citation needed|date=June 2017|reason=Youtube is not a reliable source}}

===ICE controversy with Governor Carcieri===
On June 8, 2008, Marco Riz, an illegal immigrant from [[Guatemala]] who had been arrested twice the previous year while under a deportation order, was charged with the robbery and rape of a 30-year-old woman.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/kidnap_rape_06-14-08_MRAGURH_v41.373621f.html |title=Suspect charged in Warwick robbery, rape &#124; Rhode Island news |work= The Providence Journal |date=2008-06-14 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> A federal [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) agent criticized the Providence Police Department for not checking Riz's immigration status at the time of his previous arrest.<ref name="projo.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.projo.com/news/stategovernment/content/carcieri_cicilline_immigration_06-26-08_F9ALH_v30.403b5e0.html |title=Case of illegal immigrant fires political feud &#124; State Government |work= The Providence Journal |date=2008-06-26 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref> The governor of Rhode Island, [[Donald Carcieri]], blamed Cicilline for the department's failure.  Previously, Carcieri had signed an executive order requiring all state officials to work with ICE on arrests or hirings of illegal immigrants.  When Carcieri asked the same of local agents, Providence Police Chief [[Dean Esserman]] refused.  Cicilline responded that it has been the policy of the Police Department to work with ICE and its database on all arrests, that the policy had been followed when Riz was arrested, and that the ICE had failed to act.<ref name="projo.com"/>

On July 8, 2008, Rhode Island Governor Donald Carcieri claimed that Cicilline was not upholding his oath of office by failing to report illegal immigrants, suggesting the [[U.S. Attorney]] investigate the mayor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.firesociety.com/forum/thread/27362/Gov.-Carcieri-deepens-war-of-words-with-Providence-Mayor-David-Cicilline/ |title=HugeDomains.com - FireSociety.com is for sale |publisher=Fire Society |date= |accessdate=2016-05-19}}</ref> Mayor Cicilline responded by accusing Carcieri of "playing politics", eight days later writing an op-ed in ''[[The Providence Journal]]'' stating that the city always has and will continue to report all arrests to immigration authorities, and that the focus is therefore inappropriate.<ref>{{cite web |author=David N.

Before reporting to prison, John M. Cicilline gave the city of Providence a $75,000 check for taxes owed by a client, but asked that the check not be cashed and only held as collateral.  Two of the mayor's top aides told the city tax collector Robert Ceprano, not to cash the check because it would bounce. In four instances, Ceprano said mayoral aides pressured him to perform tax favors for the mayor's friends and/or campaign contributors. The mayor claimed the taxpayers had been given relief because  the city had made errors on their taxes, not because they were his friends or contributors. During the controversy, Ceprano was fired.<ref>{{cite news |author= Stanton, Mike |title=Providence tax collector says he was pressured to give favors |url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/Cicilline_Audit_01-24-09_HED2RHS_v18.3fec501.html |work=The Providence Journal |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref>

On May 10, 2009, Robert Ceprano filed a lawsuit against the City of Providence alleging conspiracy, corruption, libel and wrongful termination. The suit accuses John M. Cicilline, the mayor's imprisoned brother, of attempting to defraud the City of Providence by writing a bad check for $75,000 on behalf of a delinquent taxpayer. Furthermore, it alleges, the mayor and his aides "willfully conspired...to conceal John M. Cicilline's illegal activities". Ceprano also charges that he was fired not for poor job performance, but because he resisted the mayor's efforts to perform tax favors for political friends and supporters.  Lawyers for Ceprano are asking for $10 million.<ref>{{cite news |author= Stanton, Mike |title=Fired Providence tax collecter alleges corruption |url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/Ceprano_Lawsuit_05-13-09_O6EBP9J_v13.3b512a6.html |work=The Providence Journal |date=2008-05-13 |accessdate=2009-07-11}}</ref> The single count complaint against John M.

===Budget controversy===
Shortly after assuming office, Cicilline's successor as the Mayor of the City of Providence, Angel Taveras, announced that the City was facing a "category 5" hurricane due to its substantial debt. Tavares was compelled to engage in austerity cuts including teacher layoffs and paycuts for city employees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.browndailyherald.com/mobile/city-looks-to-renegotiate-tax-agreement-with-the-university-1.2505142 |work=Brown Daily Herald|author= Peracchio, Claire  |title=City looks to renegotiate tax agreement with the University}}</ref> The total structural debt inherited by Tavares in 2011 was $180 million.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/rhode-island/statements/2011/mar/20/david-cicilline/cicilline-says-providence-had-very-little-reserve-/|title = Cicilline says Providence had "very little" in reserve fund when he took office}}</ref>

A report commissioned by the City of Providence found that the Cicilline administration had transferred funds from the Undesignated Surplus (the city's cash reserves) without the proper approval of the City Council, had not provided financial information on a timely basis to the independent auditor, the City Council or the Internal Auditor, and had not provided the City Council with monthly financial statements or with projections of year-end surpluses or deficits, among other findings.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://council.providenceri.com/webfm_send/60 |title = Corrective Action Plan to Restore Sound Financial Management|author1=Matthew M.

Fitch Ratings also downgraded Providence's ratings, citing "imprudent budgeting decisions and failure to implement recurring budget solutions". Ciciline, who portrayed himself as a reformer looking to restore transparency to city hall, was criticized by his opponents from the primary and House elections: Democrat Anthony Gemma said that he felt Cicilline had lied his way to federal office and Republican John Loughlin said "You just don't lie to people in such a transparent way."<ref name="Under Fire"/>

A year later, it was reported that Providence could be on the brink of bankruptcy. Former Mayor Vincent Cianci put much blame on Cicilline for Providence's problems, saying that although he didn't think it was entirely his fault, he did hide it from the public. Experts have said that the only way out for Providence may be to declare bankruptcy.<ref name="Hiding Debt">{{cite news|title=‘Buddy’ Cianci takes shots at David Cicilline for ‘hiding’ $100M debt |url=http://bostonherald.com/news/regional/view/20220330mano_a_mayor_in_providence_cianci_takes_shots_at_cicilline_for_hiding_100m_debt|newspaper=The Boston Herald|date=30 March 2012}}</ref><ref name=Unavoidable>{{cite news|title=Providence Bankruptcy Seen as Unavoidable on Budget Gap|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-03-27/providence-bankruptcy-seen-as-unavoidable-on-budget-gap.html|newspaper=Bloomberg}}</ref>
