==Florida Legislature==
After an unsuccessful bid for the [[Florida House of Representatives]] in 1980, Brown was elected two years later from a newly drawn House district that encompassed predominantly African-American neighborhoods around downtown Jacksonville.<ref name=":1" /><ref name=":0" /> She served in the House for ten years.

===Elections===
====1992–2008====
After the 1990 census, the Florida legislature carved out a new [[Florida's 3rd congressional district|3rd congressional district]] in the northern part of the state. This district was designed to enclose an African-American majority within its boundaries. A horseshoe-shaped district encompassing largely African-American neighborhoods in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]], and [[Lake City, Florida|Lake City]],<ref name="lyonscheck">Bill Adair and Monica Davey [http://www.sptimes.com/State/72898/Rep_Brown_explains_ch.html "Rep. Brown explains check from Lyons"], St. Petersburg Times, July 28, 1998</ref> the 3rd district seemed likely to send Florida's first African-American to Congress since Reconstruction, and Brown decided to run.<ref name="commend">[http://www.legislature.state.al.us/searchableInstruments/2000RS/Resolutions/SR109.htm Resolution of the State Senate of Alabama Commending Congresswoman Corrine Brown] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613203553/http://www.legislature.state.al.us/searchableInstruments/2000RS/Resolutions/SR109.htm |date=June 13, 2011}}, Alabama State Legislature, 2000.</ref>

Brown faced several candidates in the 1992 Democratic primary, but the strongest opponent to emerge was Andy Johnson, a white talk radio host from Jacksonville. Brown defeated Johnson in the primary and in a two-candidate runoff, and went on to win the general election in November 1992.<ref name="stanford">[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/pubpolicy_minorityvoters.shtml "Concentrating Minority Voters Builds Liberal Strength in the South"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302001207/http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/pubpolicy_minorityvoters.shtml |date=March 2, 2012 }}, Stanford University Graduate School of Business News, April 11, 2004</ref>

In 1995, the 3rd district was struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court]] as an unconstitutional racial gerrymander.<ref name="redistrict">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1365/is_n3_v27/ai_18727219 "The shape of things to come: Cleo Fields is the first to fall as redistricting changes the political map — Blacks in Congress are threatened — Elections '96"], Black Enterprise, Oct 1996.</ref> One of the main instigators of the lawsuit that led to the redistricting was Brown's 1992 opponent, Andy Johnson. Brown railed against the change, complaining that "[t]he Bubba I beat couldn't win at the ballot box [so] he took it to court," in an interview with ''New Republic''. Although the district was redrawn to be more compact and its black population decreased, Brown won reelection in 1996.<ref name="senatetestimony">{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1955&wit_id=5462 |title="Testimony of Professor David Canon" |accessdate=2006-07-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728010340/http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1955&wit_id=5462 |archivedate=July 28, 2006 |df=mdy }} (June 21, 2006).

On June 1, 2009, Brown announced she would form an [[exploratory committee]] for a possible run for the Democratic nomination for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Mel Martinez]] saying, "These are challenging times for Florida.

{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 5}}
After decennial redistricting in 2012, Brown's district was renumbered as the 5th district, but its basic shape remained the same, stretching from Jacksonville to Orlando. It was identified as one of the most [[Gerrymandering|gerrymandered]] districts in the country.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/05/15/americas-most-gerrymandered-congressional-districts/ |title=America's most gerrymandered congressional districts |last1=Ingraham |first1=Christopher |date=May 15, 2014 |work=The Washington Post |accessdate=May 21, 2014}}</ref> The League of Women Voters of Florida and the Florida Democratic Party challenged the new redistricting plan in court, claiming that the new 5th district was drawn to favor its incumbent and the Republican Party by packing Democratic voters, in violation of the newly adopted Fair Districts Amendment.<ref name="FDP Lawsuit">{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Matt|title=Florida Democrats file lawsuit on Congress maps, cite Corrine Brown's district|url=http://jacksonville.com/news/florida/2012-03-26/story/florida-democrats-file-lawsuit-congress-maps-cite-corrine-browns|accessdate=June 1, 2012|newspaper=Florida Times-Union|date=March 26, 2012}}</ref>

In 2015, the [[Supreme Court of Florida|Florida Supreme Court]] ruled that the congressional redistricting plan was a partisan gerrymander in violation of the Fair Districts Amendment, and ordered the 5th district to be substantially redrawn. Brown challenged the new court-ordered map in federal court, arguing that the new plan violated the federal [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|Voting Rights Act]].

===Tenure===
Brown was one of the 31 representatives who voted against counting the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml Final vote results for roll call 7], January 6, 2005</ref> In 2006, she voted "no" on the Child Custody Protection Act, Public Expression of Religion Act, [[Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act]], [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]], and Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 2006. She voted "yes" on the [[SAFE Port Act]].<ref name=washpoproject /> On September 29, 2008, Brown voted for the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].<ref name="Bailout Roll Call">[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/09/29/bailout.rollcall.0929.pdf Bailout roll call], September 29, 2008, retrieved on September 29, 2008</ref><ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110716095145/http://www.themiddleclass.org/legislator/corrine-brown-43?gclid=CLSPofu6sp0CFSXyDAodPkLIjw What has Corrine Brown done for the middle class], accessed October 10, 2009</ref>

On her 2004 political courage test at www.votesmart.org, Brown stated that she supports decriminalization of marijuana (moving from schedule I to presumably a lower schedule). This means if someone is caught with small personal amounts it would presumably be a fine instead of an arrest. She supports increasing funding for drug treatment programs rather than building more prisons. If a doctor says that a patient can benefit from marijuana, she supports listening to the doctor rather than to the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=26797 |title=Project Vote Smart – Representative Corrine Brown – Issue Positions (Political Courage Test) |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

Brown has received some of her strongest support from religious leaders, organized labor, and the sugar industry.<ref name="lyonscheck"/><ref name="lyonscheck2">Monica Davey, David Barstow and David Dahl [http://www.sptimes.com/State/41498/Lawmaker_got_10_000_f.html "Lawmaker got $10,000 from Lyons fund"] St. Petersburg Times, April 14, 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bio/fec/?id=164&cycle=2007-2008 Corrine Brown PAC contributions 2007-8] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306050721/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bio/fec/?id=164&cycle=2007-2008 |date=March 6, 2012 }}, Congress.org</ref>

Key votes that Brown has made recently include HR 822, the National Right To Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011 on November 16, 2011, which she voted against,<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll852.xml Final Vote Results For Roll Call 852]; November 16, 2011</ref> HR 358, the Prohibiting Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act, which she voted against, and HJ Res 68, Authorizing Limited Use of U.S. Armed Forces in Libya, which she was in favor.

In 2003–2005, Brown co-sponsored legislation regarding [[civil rights]] and [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]]. She also participated in [[Michael Moore]]'s "Slacker" college voter drive tour.

====Interest group ratings====
In terms of interest group ratings, Brown held high percentages in pro-choice groups such as the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates – Positions on Reproductive Rights  (for which she has a 100% rating), NARAL Pro-Choice America – Positions (100%), National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association – House of Representatives Score (100%). Brown overall held high percentage rates from other issue groups involving animal and wildlife issues, senior and security issues, labor, education, and welfare and poverty. Meanwhile, Brown's ratings were lower in issues that deal with agriculture and economics such as National Taxpayers Union – Positions on Tax and Spending (5%), American Farm Bureau Federation – Positions (33%), and United States Chamber of Commerce – Positions (13%). Other relatively low rates for Brown from interest groups include trade, conservative issues, national security, indigenous peoples issues, gun issues, immigration, and foreign aid and policy issues. The ratings do not necessarily correlate with Brown's positions or votes on certain issues during her time as a representative in the House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/candidate/evaluations/26797/corrine-brown |title=Corrine Brown's Ratings and Endorsements – The Voter's Self Defense System – Vote Smart |work=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=September 19, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Political controversies===
'''National Baptist Convention check'''<br>In 1998, Brown was questioned by the House Ethics Committee about receiving a $10,000 check from [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] leader and long-time associate, [[Henry Lyons]].<ref name="lyonscheck"/> Brown confirmed receiving the check and denied she had used the money improperly.<ref name="lyonscheck"/> Brown said that she had taken the check and converted it into another check made out to Pameron Bus Tours to pay for transportation to a rally she organized in [[Tallahassee]]. She said that she didn't have to report the money, and that she had been cleared, explaining the rally was to protest the reorganization of her district lines, and she did not use it for herself.<ref name="lyonscheck"/>

'''Forgery'''<br>
The Federal Election Commission admonished Brown and Brown's former campaign treasurer quit after he discovered that his name had been forged on her campaign reports. The staffer alleged to have forged the treasurer's signature stayed with Brown and as of 1998 was her chief of staff.<ref name="lyonscheck2"/>

'''Congressional Accountability Project'''<br>
On June 9, 1998, the Congressional Accountability Project voted to conduct a formal inquiry regarding Brown. The Project called for the [[U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct]] to determine whether Brown had violated House ethics rules.<ref>[http://www.congressproject.org/ethics/corbrowncom.html Ethics complaint]. Congressproject.org.</ref> One of the complaints was that Brown's adult daughter, Shantrel Brown, had received a luxury automobile as a gift from an agent of a [[Gambia]]n millionaire named Foutanga Sissoko. Sissoko, a friend of Congresswoman Brown, had been imprisoned in Miami after pleading guilty to charges of bribing a customs officer. Brown had worked to secure his release, pressuring U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] to deport Sissoko back to his homeland as an alternative to continued incarceration. The Project held this violated the House gift rule, but Brown denied she had acted improperly. The congressional subcommittee investigating Brown found insufficient evidence to issue a Statement of Alleged Violation, but said she had acted with poor judgment in connection with Sissoko.<ref name="lyonscheck"/><ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:MmW84qdNr_AJ:ethics.house.gov/Media/PDF/Press%2520StatementCorrineBrownend.pdf+%2B%22corrine+brown%22+site:ethics.house.gov&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi8Gz_RHqEEBRCmDnQ5fWh7ol0GUtiI0M4GlTMfegkAUaKpXRN23BmGmHo8UsQ77voYt5T09hb8USWMy-TgU6MR91_iNQQfygBucYM9edWmO-TAtmKStM4ErAB2lgRxiqFZsrVd&sig=AHIEtbQLcJIgDY6hV5Z_JbvP0w4HhPmL8w Ethics Report Press Release]; House.Ethics.Gov; September 21, 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.house.gov/ethics/Press_Statement_CorrineBrownend.html "Statement of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct  in the Matter of Representative Corrine Brown"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080411184233/http://www.house.gov/ethics/Press_Statement_CorrineBrownend.html |date=April 11, 2008 }} (September 21, 2000). House.gov.</ref>

'''2000 election'''<br>
In July 2004 Brown was rebuked by the House of Representatives after she referred to the [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|disputed 2000 presidential election]] in Florida as a "coup d'état". This comment came during floor debate over HR 4818, which would have provided for international monitoring of the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]].<ref>David Decamp [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/071604/met_16113272.shtml], ''The Florida Times-Union'', July 16, 2004</ref>

===Campaign finances===
During her 2009–2010 campaign, Brown raised up to $966,669 from fundraising. Brown’s top contributors included [[CSX Corporation]], a railroad-based freight transportation company with its headquarters in Jacksonville; [[Carnival Corporation & plc|Carnival Corporation]], cruise line operator; Picerne Real Estate Group; [[Union Pacific Railroad|Union Pacific Corp]] and [[Berkshire Hathaway]], which owns [[BNSF Railway]]. Brown's top industry contributors included those railroads, lawyers/farm firms, real estate, transportation unions, and sea transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00002713&cycle=2010|title=Rep.

During her campaign, the largest source of funds was given by large individual companies, which accounted for 54% of the contributions, and PAC contributions, which accounted for 36%. Sources of funds also included small individual contributions, self-financing on Brown's part and other sources.

==Felony fraud conviction==
In July 2016, Brown and her chief of staff, Elias "Ronnie" Simmons, pleaded not guilty to a 22 count federal indictment in relation to a non-profit charity, One Door for Education Foundation. The indictment included charges of participating in a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, multiple counts of mail and wire fraud, concealing material facts on required financial disclosure forms, theft of government property, obstruction of the Internal Revenue Service laws, and filing false tax returns.<ref name="CNN1">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/politics/rep-corrine-brown-indicted-for-alleged-role-regarding-fraudulent-education-charity/index.html|title=Rep.
