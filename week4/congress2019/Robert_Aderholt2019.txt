==Political campaigns==
As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat "in the [[Tom Bevill]] tradition". This was a seriously contested race, receiving a deal of national coverage and significant support from the Republican Party. [[Newt Gingrich]] personally visited the district during the campaign. Aderholt won narrowly, 50%–48%, becoming only the second Republican to represent this district since Reconstruction. The first, [[James D. Martin|Jim Martin]], was swept into office in what was then the 7th District during the 1964 wave that delivered the state's electoral votes to [[Barry Goldwater]]. Aderholt has never faced another contest nearly that close, and has been reelected nine times. He even ran unopposed in 2004, 2010, 2014, and 2016.

Aderholt's increasing margins reflected the growing Republican trend in this part of Alabama. While Democrats still have a majority in voter registration, the district's Democrats are very conservative on social issues, even by Alabama standards. With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+30, it is the fifth-most Republican district in the nation and the third-most Republican district east of the Mississippi.

===2010 campaign===

===2012 campaign===
{{further|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2012#District 4}}
Aderholt was reelected in the November election where he beat [[Alabama House of Representatives|State representative]] [[Daniel Boman]], the Democratic nominee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Alabama Secretary of State|url=http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2012/primary/Primary_Results_Certified-Democratic-2012-03-22.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120911125014/http://www.sos.state.al.us/downloads/election/2012/primary/Primary_Results_Certified-Democratic-2012-03-22.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-11|df=}}</ref>
In 2012 Aderholt raised $1,207,484.98 for his campaign, but spent only $963,859.15.
Parker Towing was his largest contributor, providing $24,000.00.
$493,856, 41% of his contributions came from large individual contributions.
$583,000, 48% came from PACs.{{sfn|VoteSmart|2012}}

==Political positions==

===Defense spending===
He does not support reducing the defense budget to close the [[United States public debt|American deficit]], and in May 2012 said "cuts to defense budgets – the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility – shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending".<ref>{{cite web|title=Redstone's Pivotal Role in Nation's Technology Must be Protected, says Rep. Robert Aderholt |url=http://aderholt.house.gov/common/popup/popup.cfm?action=item.print&itemID=1435 |publisher=AL.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> 

===Environmental issues===
During the 2013 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for the amendment by Rep. Scalise (R-LA)<ref group="Notes">H. Amendment: H.Amdt. 448 to H.R. 367</ref> which would "require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval.  Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass."{{sfn|Freedom Works|2013}} Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) which stated, "I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry."<ref>{{cite web|title=Inhofe Says EPA's New Boiler Rule Could Kill Nearly 800,000 Manufacturing Jobs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/28/inhofe-says-epas-new-boiler-rule-kill-nearly-manufacturing-jobs/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Aderholt was against the policies promoted by the [[Copenhagen Climate Change Conference]] as well as the US proposed Cap and Trade Bill, part of what he argued was an "unrealistic carbon emissions reduction mandate" that would result in a loss of American jobs. He agreed with the global warming petition project<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.petitionproject.org/|title=Global warming petition project|publisher=Global warming petition project|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref> that, "[t]here is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing, or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth's atmosphere and disruption of the Earth's climate."{{sfn|Aderhodt|2010}}

===Gun policy===
Aderholt is a supporter of [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]]. He was endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association]] in the 2010 general election,<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama to present gun agenda; all but one Alabama representative supported by NRA|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Robert_Aderholt_Gun_Control.htm|publisher=On The Issues|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> and received $2,000 from them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Aderholt on Gun Control|url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/01/national_rifle_association_bac.html|publisher=Challen Stevens|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

In the wake of the [[2016 Orlando nightclub shooting]], Aderholt called it a [[terrorist attack]] and stated "we do not have the luxury of debating the political correctness of 'radical Islam'." He stated a need to "hunt down those who would do us harm." He opposed the media and President Obama using the shooting to "push any type of political agenda relating to [[gun control]]. He made a call to the White House and Congress to "protect the homeland."<ref name="Berkowitz61616">{{cite web|last1=Berkowitz|first1=Bonnie|last2=Cai|first2=Weiyi|last3=Lu|first3=Denise|last4=Gamio|first4=Lazaro|title=Everything lawmakers said (and didn't say) after the Orlando mass shooting|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/how-lawmakers-responded-to-the-orlando-mass-shooting/|website=Washington Post|accessdate=31 December 2017}}</ref>

=== LGBT issues ===

Aderholt is opposed to [[same-sex marriage]]. He has received high ratings from the [[Family Research Council]], the [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and the [[American Family Association]].{{sfn|VoteSmart|2012}}  In 2013, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Scorecard: Measuring Support for Equality in the 112th Congress|url=http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/112thCongressionalScorecard_2012.pdf#__utma=149406063.1555353042.1407266521.1407266533.1407268463.3&__utmb=149406063.1.10.1407268463&__utmc=149406063&__utmx=-&__utmz=149406063.1407268463.3.3.utmcsr=google|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Regulatory reform===
In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name ="FreedomWorks">{{cite web|title=FreedomWorks Scorecard|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/robert-aderholt-0}}</ref>

=== Abortion ===
During the "[[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]]" rally in Washington on Jan 22, 2010, he said, "The issue of abortion and the sanctity of life is something that I feel strongly about and I encourage my colleagues to look for ways to curb and stop abortions in the United States, while compassionately educating on this important issue."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Baragona|first1=Justin|title=Taking Back the House, Vol. 3: Robert Aderholt and Alabama's 4th District|url=http://www.politicususa.com/2013/10/25/house-vol-3-robert-aderholt-alabamas-4th-district.html|website=PoliticalUSA|accessdate=25 January 2017}}</ref>

===Tax policy===
Aderholt is a signer of [[Americans for Tax Reform]]'s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].{{sfn|ATR|2010}}

He voted in favor of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].<ref name="Almukhtar">{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}</ref> Aderholt said he voted for the bill "to give back more money to Alabama taxpayers."<ref name="Hagstrom122017">{{cite web|last1=Hagstrom|first1=Jerry|title=Senate Passes Tax Bill Late Tuesday, But Rules Force House to Revote Wednesday|url=https://www.dtnpf.com/agriculture/web/ag/news/world-policy/article/2017/12/20/senate-passes-tax-bill-late-tuesday|website=DTN Progressive Farmer|accessdate=21 December 2017}}</ref> He also stated that the bill "does the right thing." He cited the raising of the [[child tax credit]], changes to the state and local tax deductions, and stated that "more than 80% the people in the 4th District of Alabama will receive a tax cut." Aderholt also says that more businesses will stay in the US due to a lower corporate tax rate and therefore the act is a "jobs bill."<ref name="WHNT121917">{{cite web|title=House passes $1.5T tax bill, delivering on a major piece of GOP agenda|url=http://whnt.com/2017/12/19/house-passes-1-5t-tax-bill-delivering-on-a-major-piece-of-gop-agenda/|website=WHNT.com|accessdate=21 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}</ref>
