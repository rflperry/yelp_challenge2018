'''Barbara Jean Lee''' (born July 16, 1946) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|13}}, serving since 1998. She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district, numbered as the [[California's 9th congressional district|9th District]] from 1998 to 2013, is based in [[Oakland]] and includes most of northern [[Alameda County]]. She is the first woman to represent this district.

Lee is the former chair of the Congressional Black Caucus and is the current Whip and former Co-Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.<ref name="Committees & Caucuses">{{Cite web|url=https://lee.house.gov/about/committees-and-caucuses|title=Committees & Caucuses {{!}} Barbara Lee - Congresswoman for the 13th District of California|website=lee.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref>  She is the Vice Chair and a founding member of the LGBT Equality Caucus.<ref name="Committees & Caucuses"/>  Lee is notable as the only member of either chamber of Congress to vote against the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists|authorization of use of force]] following the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2001/roll342.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 342], ''U.S. House of Representatives''.

==Political career==
As president of the Mills College Black Student Union, Lee invited Congresswoman [[Shirley Chisholm]] to speak on campus and went on to work on Chisolm's 1972 presidential campaign, serving as her delegate at the 1972 Democratic National Convention.<ref>{{cite news|title=Biography: Early Years|url=https://lee.house.gov/about/biography|accessdate=January 11, 2017}}</ref> Also as a student, she was a volunteer at the Oakland chapter of the [[Black Panther Party]]'s Community Learning Center and worked on Panther co-founder [[Bobby Seale]]'s 1973 Oakland mayoral campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mindfully.org/Reform/2006/Black-Panthers-Led8oct06.htm|title=A Legacy of Activism: Behind Fury, Black Panthers Laid Course for Social Programs WILLIAM BRAND & CECILY BURT / Oakland Tribune 8oct2006|publisher=Mindfully.org|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> Lee was a staff member for United States Representative [[Ron Dellums]] and a member of the [[California State Assembly]] and the [[California State Senate]] before entering the House. She ran for Congress in a [[special election]] that created a year-long series of five special elections as various East Bay politicians vied for political office, taking 66 percent of the vote. (For a detailed account of these elections, see [[Special election musical chairs]].) She won the seat in her own right later that year with 82.8 percent of the vote, and has been reelected nine more times with no substantive opposition in what has long been one of the most Democratic districts in both California and the nation. The district and its predecessors have been in Democratic hands without interruption since 1959.

===AUMF opposition===
Lee gained national attention in 2001 as the only member of congress to vote "No" on the [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]] (AUMF), stating that she voted no not because she opposed military action but because she believed the AUMF, as written, granted overly-broad powers to wage war to the president at a time when the facts regarding the situation were not yet clear. She "warned her colleagues to be 'careful not to embark on an open-ended war with neither an exit strategy nor a focused target'".<ref>Polner, Murray (March 1, 2010) [http://www.amconmag.com/article/2010/mar/01/00032/ Left Behind], ''[[The American Conservative]]''</ref>

Lee explained,<blockquote>"It was a blank check to the president to attack anyone involved in the September 11 events—anywhere, in any country, without regard to our nation's long-term foreign policy, economic and national security interests, and without time limit. In granting these overly broad powers, the Congress failed its responsibility to understand the dimensions of its declaration. I could not support such a grant of war-making authority to the president; I believe it would put more innocent lives at risk. The president has the constitutional authority to protect the nation from further attack, and he has mobilized the armed forces to do just that. The Congress should have waited for the facts to be presented and then acted with fuller knowledge of the consequences of our action".<ref name="Why I opposed AUMF">{{Cite news |author=Barbara Lee |date=September 23, 2001 |url=https://www.sfgate.com/opinion/article/Why-I-opposed-the-resolution-to-authorize-force-2876893.php <!--possibly behind paywall: https://www.sfchronicle.com/opinion/article/Why-I-opposed-the-resolution-to-authorize-force-2876893.php --> |title=Why I opposed the resolution to authorize force |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref></blockquote>This vote made nationwide news reports and brought about a large and extremely polarized response, with the volume of calls gridlocking the switchboard of her Capitol Hill office. Although it appears to have reflected the beliefs of the majority of her constituents, the majority of responses from elsewhere in the nation were angry and hostile, some referring to her as "communist" and "traitor". Many of the responses included death threats against her or her family to the point that the Capitol Police provided round-the-clock plainclothes bodyguards.<ref name="Why I opposed AUMF" />  She was also criticized by politicians and in editorial pages of conservative-leaning newspapers, e.g. [[John Fund]]'s column in ''[[The Wall Street Journal]].''<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=95001156|title=Opinion, Editorials, Columns, Op-Ed, Letters to the Editor, Commentary - Wall Street Journal - Wsj.com|publisher=Opinionjournal.com|accessdate=December 11, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090413184026/http://www.opinionjournal.com/diary/?id=95001156|archive-date=April 13, 2009|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}{{full citation needed|date=June 2018}}</ref> She was awarded the Seán MacBride Peace Prize by the [[International Peace Bureau]] in 2002 for that vote.

In her speech, she quoted the Rev. [[Nathan D. Baxter]], dean of [[National Cathedral]]: "As we act, let us not become the evil that we deplore."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/9/16/let_us_not_become_the_evil_we_deplore|title="Let Us Not Become the Evil We Deplore" By Amy Goodman|website=Democracy Now!|accessdate=August 28, 2016}}</ref>

On June 29, 2017, the House Appropriations Committee approved Rep. Barbara Lee's amendment to repeal the 2001 authorization for the use of military force that was the foundation of the U.S.'s post-September 11 military actions. The amendment, if passed, will require that the 2001 authorization for the use of military force be scrapped within 240 days.<ref>http://www.thedailybeast.com/house-committee-approves-repeal-of-2001-military-authorization</ref>

;Education
Lee is the author of the [[Shirley A. Chisholm]] United States-Caribbean Educational Exchange Act, which would enhance U.S. foreign relations with [[CARICOM]] nations. This act directs the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) to develop a comprehensive program that extends and expands existing primary and secondary school initiatives in the Caribbean to provide: (1) teacher training methods; and (2) increased community involvement in school activities.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20160408122312/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c110%3AH.R.176]</ref> The bill is named for former Congresswoman [[Shirley Chisholm]], who helped inspire Lee to become involved in politics when Chisholm ran for the Democratic nomination for President; Lee became the Northern California Chair of the Chisholm campaign.

;Housing
As a congresswoman for the Bay Area, Barbara Lee has made affordable housing in East Bay area and beyond a top priority. Lee has supported and backed legislation meant to expand home ownership opportunities, improve public housing quality, and assist the homeless.<ref>{{cite web|title=Profiles of Social Workers Assisting Those in Need|url=http://socialworkdegree.case.edu/resources/infographic/10-profiles-of-social-workers/|website=Case Western Reserve University|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}</ref>

==== Gun legislation position ====
Lee is a strong advocate for legislation restricting the availability of guns. She participated in the 2016 sit-in against gun violence in the House of Representatives. Democratic members of Congress adopted the slogan "No Bill, No Break" in an attempt to push the introduction of legislation increasing restrictions on guns.

In a statement on the sit-in, Lee said,

"Time and again, House Republicans have blocked our ability to keep Americans safe by preventing us from passing common sense gun reforms, including closing a glaring loophole that allows suspected terrorists to purchase weapons of war. These weapons of war, some of which can fire 900 rounds per minute, have no place on America's streets. We simply cannot allow this insanity. My constituents and people from all over the nation have been demanding action, but they are being ignored by the House's Republican leadership. Too many people have already been lost to senseless gun violence. Enough is enough; Congress must act to protect the lives of Americans".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lee.house.gov/news/press-releases/congresswoman-lee-joins-house-sit-in-on-gun-violence|title=Congresswoman Lee Joins House Sit-In on Gun Violence {{!}} Barbara Lee - Congresswoman for the 13th District of California|website=lee.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref>

==== Black Panthers ====
In 1968, Lee began volunteering at the [[Black Panther Party|Black Panther Party's]] Community Learning Center in Oakland, California.<ref name=":1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.blackpast.org/aaw/lee-barbara-j-1946|title=Lee, Barbara J. (1946 -  ) {{!}} The Black Past: Remembered and Reclaimed|website=www.blackpast.org|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref> Lee also worked on [[Bobby Seale|Bobby Seale's]] 1973 campaign for mayor in Oakland.

Lee disagreed with the [[National Park Service]] removing funding for a Black Panther Legacy Project in 2017. The Representative released a statement saying, "It is outrageous that the National Park Service has stripped resources from the Black Panther Party Research, Interpretation & Memory Project.  The Black Panther Party was an integral part of the civil rights movement and the public has a right to know their history. I call upon the National Park Service and the Department of Interior to provide a full explanation as to why these critical federal resources have been taken away".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lee.house.gov/news/press-releases/congresswoman-lee-responds-to-nps-funding-pulled-from-black-panther-party-legacy-project|title=Congresswoman Lee Responds to NPS Funding Pulled from Black Panther Party Legacy Project {{!}} Barbara Lee - Congresswoman for the 13th District of California|website=lee.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref>

==== Environment ====
Lee introduced the Women and Climate Change Act in February 2018. The bill aims to create a Federal Interagency Working Group on Women and Climate Change.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4932|title=H.R.4932 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Women and Climate Change Act of 2018|last=Barbara|first=Lee,|date=2018-02-09|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-04-04}}</ref> Lee said on the Act, "Climate change is already impacting communities around the world with a disproportionate effect on the world's poorest residents. Women make up the majority of the world's poor and are especially vulnerable to abrupt changes in the environment. As leaders in their families, women are called upon to find food and clean water, secure safe housing, and care for loved ones. As climate change worsens, provoking historic droughts, rising sea levels and violent storms, women and girls will bear the brunt of this global crisis".<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://lee.house.gov/news/press-releases/rep-barbara-lee-announces-introduction-of-women-and-climate-change-act|title=Rep.
