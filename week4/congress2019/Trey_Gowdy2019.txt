{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2010#District 4}}
In the summer of 2009, Gowdy, announced that he would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Bob Inglis]] in the Republican primary for {{ushr|South Carolina|4}}.

Inglis, who got a 93% lifetime rating from the [[American Conservative Union]],<ref>''ACU Ratings of Congress: 111th Congress, Second Session (40th Edition)''.

{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2012 #District 4}}

Gowdy was initially quoted as being "disappointed" with the version, even though the redrawn 4th would have been as solidly Republican as its predecessor. The final map moved a portion of Greenville County to the 3rd district while leaving all of Spartanburg County in the 4th district. Gowdy was quoted as being "pleased" with this version, since Greenville and Spartanburg counties remained linked.

According to ''Politico'', during his tenure in Congress, Gowdy was "considered one of the GOP's most versatile and skilled legal experts, owing to his background as a federal prosecutor."<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/02/gowdy-trump-spygate-theory-617948|title=Trump allies gang up on Gowdy|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en}}</ref> While chairing the House Oversight Committee, Gowdy tackled high-profile investigations.<ref name=":0" /> Democrats criticized Gowdy for conducting his investigations in a partisan fashion.<ref name=":0" /> After Trump became President, Gowdy defended the FBI and Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election to the dismay of Trump supporters.<ref name=":0" /> However, in a June 2018 hearing, Gowdy urged Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein to wrap up the special counsel investigation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2018/06/28/rod-rosenstein-and-fbi-director-wray-to-testify-on-watchdogs-report.html|title=Rod&nbsp;Rosenstein rejects call to 'finish' Russia investigation, saying it should end 'appropriately'|last=Breuninger|first=Kevin|date=2018-06-28|work=CNBC|access-date=2018-06-28}}</ref> Rosenstein rejected the suggestion, saying the special counsel investigation should finish "appropriately".<ref name=":1" /> Democrats criticized Gowdy for not fully pursuing investigations into potential conflicts of interest in the Trump White House or investigating the White House security clearance process.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/trey-gowdy-a-prosecutor-and-partisan-at-the-heart-of-the-gops-russia-probe/2018/05/31/9924cf32-6500-11e8-99d2-0d678ec08c2f_story.html|title=Trey Gowdy: A prosecutor and partisan at the heart of the GOP's Russia probe|last=Demirjian|first=Karoun|date=2018-05-31|work=Washington Post|access-date=2018-06-02|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>

Gowdy worked on the Committee on the Judiciary, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Gowdy frequently speaks on the floor of the House on issues ranging from [[ATF gunwalking scandal|Operation Fast and Furious]] to his support for reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

In 2012, he received the ''Defender of Economic Freedom'' award from the fiscally conservative [[501(c) organization|501(c)4]] organization [[Club for Growth]]. The award is given to members of Congress who have the year's highest ranking, according to the Club for Growth's metrics.

An ardent social conservative, Gowdy considers himself "pro-life plus." He not only believes "in the sanctity of life," but argues that "the strategy should be broader than waiting for the Supreme Court to revisit ''[[Roe v.

In May 2018, Gowdy challenged President Trump's unsubstantiated conspiracy theory that the FBI had spied on his 2016 presidential campaign.<ref name=":0" /> As a result of this, Gowdy was attacked by various Trump allies, and ''Politico'' reported that Gowdy was "virtually alone, getting little support from his House colleagues."<ref name=":0" /> In June 2018, Speaker [[Paul Ryan]] came out in support of Gowdy, saying that Gowdy's assessment was "accurate".<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/06/us/politics/ryan-trump-spygate-spy.html|title=Speaker Ryan Dismisses Trump's Charges of a Spy in His Campaign|date=2018-06-06|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-06-06|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

At a July 2018 congressional hearing, Gowdy suggested impropriety on behalf of FBI agent Peter Strzok and said that Strzok showed bias against Trump and for Clinton during the 2016 presidential election and that this shaped his work for the FBI.<ref name=":02">{{Cite news|url=https://www.apnews.com/5cd36c766cf14f548bdaf050d1393d98|title=FBI agent defiantly rejects bias charges at chaotic hearing|work=AP News|access-date=2018-07-12|language=en-US}}</ref> During the hearing, Gowdy repeatedly pressed Strzok about a text message in which Strzok said "we'll stop Trump".<ref name=":02" /> Strzok explained that a "We'll stop Trump" text message was written late at night and off-the-cuff shortly after Trump denigrated the immigrant family of a fallen American war hero, and that the message reflected Strzok's belief that Americans would not vote for a candidate who engaged in such "horrible, disgusting behavior".<ref name=":02"/> Strzok said the message "was in no way—unequivocally—any suggestion that me, the FBI, would take any action whatsoever to improperly impact the electoral process for any candidate."<ref name=":02"/> Strzok added that he knew of information during the 2016 presidential campaign that could have damaged Trump but that he never contemplated leaking it.<ref name=":02"/> Strzok's said that the investigation into him and the Republicans' related rhetoric was misguided and played into "our enemies' campaign to tear America apart."<ref name=":02"/>

In July 2015, Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] named Gowdy as a possible nominee for [[United States Attorney General]] in a Trump cabinet.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.headlinepolitics.com/trump-just-announced-possible-cabinet-members-will-make-liberals-cringe/|title=Trump Just Announced Possible Cabinet Members That Will Make Liberals Cringe|last=Weiss|first=Rusty|date=2015-07-29|website=|publisher=Headline Politics|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-27|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In late December 2015, Gowdy endorsed Senator [[Marco Rubio]] for president, praising him as a rarity among elected officials for having kept his campaign promises.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/12/trey-gowdy-endorses-marco-rubio-217201|title=Trey Gowdy endorses Marco Rubio|date=December 29, 2015|first=Eliza|last=Collins|publisher=Politico}}</ref> Gowdy's endorsement strained his relations with [[Donald Trump]]'s campaign; Trump said that Gowdy had "failed miserably on Benghazi".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/12/28/scorned-trump-team-turns-on-man-they-once-loved.html|title=Scorned Trump Team Turns On Man They Once Loved|date=December 28, 2015|publisher=The Daily Beast}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/marco-rubio-scoring-some-big-endorsements-do-they-matter|title=Marco Rubio is scoring some big endorsements. But do they matter?|date=December 30, 2015|publisher=MSNBC}}</ref>  Rubio withdrew from the race in March, after losing his home state of [[Florida]] to Trump. Two months later, on May 20, Gowdy endorsed Trump for president, admitting that while he was a "Rubio guy", he would support the presumptive Republican nominee.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/280753-gowdy-i-endorse-trump|date=May 20, 2016|title=Gowdy endorses Trump|publisher=thehill.com}}</ref> 
After the [[Dismissal of James Comey|dismissal of FBI Director Comey]], Gowdy was being considered for his replacement. However, the veteran representative told Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions|Sessions]] that he wanted to remain in his congressional seat.<ref>Eliza Collins, 15 May 2017: [https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/15/trey-gowdy-fbi-director-james-comey-firing/101713420/ ''Rep. Trey Gowdy, a former FBI contender, keeps making Republican short lists'']</ref>

On December 1, 2017, the Congressional Office of Compliance said that while Gowdy was acting as chairman of the House Select Committee on Benghazi, a former congressional aide who alleged he was fired in part because he was not willing to focus his investigative work on Hillary Clinton (a charge which was later dropped) and because he was absent from the position while fulfilling an Air Force Reserve assignment, reached a settlement with Congress and the House Employment Counsel. An attorney for the former aide stated that "I can confirm that my client is one person who brought a veterans status discrimination and retaliation suit against Congress and that the case settled on terms that were satisfactory to my client.” It was alleged by Elise Viebeck of ‘’PowerPost’’ that Rep. Gowdy was responsible for use of taxpayer funds to pay the claim against the government.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/powerpost/gowdy-benghazi-panel-settled-wrongful-firing-suit-with-150000-in-public-funds/2017/12/01/d7c49dac-d6db-11e7-a986-d0a9770d9a3e_story.html|title=Gowdy, Benghazi panel settled wrongful firing suit with $150,000 in public funds|last=Viebeck|first=Elise|date=2017-12-01|work=Washington Post|access-date=2017-12-02|last2=Lee|first2=Michelle Ye Hee|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286}}</ref>
