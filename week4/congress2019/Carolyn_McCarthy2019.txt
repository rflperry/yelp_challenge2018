Before the election, it was reported that Democrats were concerned that McCarthy was in danger of losing her seat.<ref name="NYDN McCarthy">{{cite news|title=New York Democrats anxious as Long Island Rep.

Earlier in 2010, it was widely reported that McCarthy was considering entering the [[United States Senate special election in New York, 2010|2010 special senatorial election]] to challenge Senator [[Kirsten Gillibrand]], owing to the latter's support for gun rights.<ref>{{cite news |author=Danny Hakim |author2=Nicholas Confessore |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/24/nyregion/24senator.html |title=Paterson Picks Gillibrand for Senate Seat |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 24, 2009 |accessdate=2013-07-14}}</ref><ref>[http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/northeast/view/2009_01_23_New_York_pol_fumes_over_Senate_choice/ "New York pol fumes over Senate choice", ''The Boston Herald''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618005527/http://www.bostonherald.com/news/national/northeast/view/2009_01_23_New_York_pol_fumes_over_Senate_choice/ |date=June 18, 2009 }}</ref> Gillibrand had been appointed to the seat on January 23, 2009 by Governor [[David Paterson]] to succeed [[Hillary Clinton]], who had left the Senate to become Secretary of State in the new [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]]. McCarthy commented, saying: "I've spent 15 years trying to prevent gun violence in this country, and if he [Paterson] does pick her [Gillibrand] and if no one goes and primaries her, I will primary her." She said she would not let New York be represented by someone with a 100% rating of the NRA. On Hardball, McCarthy said that she thought Gillibrand was working for the NRA.<ref name="150 minutes">{{cite news|title=150 Minutes With Carolyn McCarthy|url=http://nymag.com/news/intelligencer/encounter/54343/|newspaper=NY News and Feature}}</ref>  On June 4, 2009, however, McCarthy announced that she would not mount a primary challenge to Gillibrand.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kleefeld |first=Eric |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/06/mccarthy-not-challenging-gillibrand-in-2010-senate-primary.php |title=McCarthy Not Challenging Gillibrand In 2010 Senate Primary &#124; TPMDC |publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]] |date=2009-06-04 |accessdate=2010-07-12}}</ref>
