==Other political offices==
In 2002, Pallone turned down an offer to replace embattled Sen. [[Bob Torricelli]] as the Democratic nominee for US Senate by Democratic Party leaders. The slot eventually went to Sen. [[Frank Lautenberg]] who ended up winning the general election. In 2004-2005, Pallone considered a gubernatorial bid against embattled and unpopular Gov. [[Jim McGreevey]] but ended up supporting eventual party nominee winner, then-Senator [[Jon Corzine]].

Early in 2005, Pallone announced his intentions to seek the [[United States Senate]] position held at the time by [[Jon Corzine]]. Corzine won the Democratic nomination for [[Governor of New Jersey]] in June 2005, and Pallone was the first New Jersey politician to officially seek Corzine's Senate seat. Pallone launched "[http://www.pallonefornewjersey.com/ Pallone for New Jersey]" to inform New Jersey citizens of his work in the House and his desire to be New Jersey's next Senator. In January 2006, Pallone announced his endorsement of [[Bob Menendez]] for Senate in the November 2006 election, ending his bid for the seat.

Pallone was an early and strong endorser of Sen. [[Hillary Clinton]] in the 2008 Democratic Party primaries. Pallone traveled to [[New Hampshire]] to campaign for Clinton. Clinton eventually lost the primary to Sen. [[Barack Obama]] who went on to become President. Pallone also endorsed [[Frank Lautenberg]] over Congressman [[Rob Andrews]].
