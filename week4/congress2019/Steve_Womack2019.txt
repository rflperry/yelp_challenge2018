==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===

====2010====
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2010#District 3}}

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican [[John Boozman]] gave it up to run for the [[United States Senate]]. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman.  He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624472|title=Our Campaigns - AR District 03 - R Primary Race - May 18, 2010|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref> In the June runoff, he defeated [[Arkansas Senate|State Senator]] and fellow Rogers resident [[Cecile Bledsoe]] 52%-48%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=648529|title=Our Campaigns - AR District 03 - R Runoff Race - Jun 08, 2010|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>

In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487764|title=Our Campaigns - AR - District 03 Race - Nov 02, 2010|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>

====2012====
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2012#District 3}}
Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid.  However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record.  As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2012/07/09/ken-aden-dropping-out-of-3rd-district-congressional-race  |title=Ken Aden dropping out of 3rd District congressional race|date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=August 15, 2012|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|first=Max|last=Brantley}}</ref> He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705043|title=Our Campaigns - AR - District 03 Race - Nov 06, 2012|website=www.ourcampaigns.com|access-date=2018-07-11}}</ref>

In a 2015 episode of his show [[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]], [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] criticized Womack for blocking the enforcement of laws proposed by the [[Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration]] that would have protected [[chicken]] farmers from being threatened or punished by the companies they work for if they spoke out regarding their farming experiences.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/06/john-oliver-vs-chicken-118510 | title=John Oliver vs. chicken | work=Politico | date=1 June 2015 | accessdate=29 March 2016 | author=Haas, Nathaniel}}</ref>
