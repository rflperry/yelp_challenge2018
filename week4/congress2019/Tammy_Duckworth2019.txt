===2016 election===
{{main|United States Senate election in Illinois, 2016}}

On March 30, 2015, Duckworth announced that she would challenge incumbent U.S. Senator [[Mark Kirk]] for his seat in the 2016 Senate election in Illinois.<ref name=ABC7-20140330>{{cite news|title=Tammy Duckworth Running Against Mark Kirk for US Senate|url=http://abc7chicago.com/politics/duckworth-running-against-kirk-for-us-senate/587706/|accessdate=March 30, 2015|publisher=Chicago ABC 7 Eyewitness News|date=March 30, 2015}}</ref> Duckworth defeated fellow Democrats Andrea Zopp and [[Napoleon Harris]] in the primary election on March 15, 2016.<ref>{{cite news|title=Duckworth, Kirk win Illinois US Senate Primaries|url=http://abc7chicago.com/politics/duckworth-kirk-win-illinois-us-senate-primaries/1247032/|accessdate=March 17, 2016|publisher=Chicago ABC 7 Eyewitness News|date=March 16, 2016}}</ref>

During a televised debate on October 27, 2016, Duckworth talked about her ancestors' past serving in the United States military. Kirk responded, "I'd forgotten that your parents came all the way from Thailand to serve George Washington." The comment led to the [[Human Rights Campaign]] withdrawing their endorsement of Kirk and switching it to Duckworth, stating his comments were "deeply offensive and racist."<ref name="Morin">{{cite news|last1=Morin|first1=Rebecca|title=Human Rights Campaign revokes Mark Kirk endorsement|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/human-rights-campaign-revokes-mark-kirk-endorsement-230495|accessdate=October 30, 2016|publisher=Politico|date=October 29, 2016}}</ref><ref name="HRC">{{cite news|title=HRC Revokes Endorsement Following Racist Comments of Senator Mark Kirk|url=http://www.hrc.org/blog/hrc-revokes-endorsement-following-racist-comments-of-senator-mark-kirk|accessdate=October 30, 2016|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|date=October 29, 2016}}</ref>

===Tenure===

In January 2018, following a federal government shut down after the Senate could not agree on a funding bill, Duckworth responded to President Trump's accusations that the Democrats were putting "unlawful immigrants" ahead of the military:
: "I spent my entire adult life looking out for the well-being, the training, the equipping of the troops for whom I was responsible. Sadly, this is something that the current occupant of the Oval Office does not seem to care to do — and I will not be lectured about what our military needs by a five-deferment draft dodger. And I have a message for Cadet Bone Spurs: If you cared about our military, you'd stop baiting Kim Jong Un into a war that could put 85,000 American troops, and millions of innocent civilians, in danger."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Brandon|title=Duckworth slams Trump: I won't be lectured on military needs by a 'five-deferment draft dodger'|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/369960-dem-slams-trump-i-wont-be-lectured-on-military-needs-by-a-five-deferment|website=The Hill|accessdate=January 20, 2018}}</ref>

==Political positions==

===Foreign policy===
[[File:Tammy Duckworth wheelchair.jpg|thumb|upright|Duckworth narrates the ''Salute to Fallen Asian Pacific Islander Heroes'' in [[Arlington, Virginia]], June 2, 2005.]]

During her unsuccessful congressional campaign in 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001.<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite news|newspaper=Northbrook Star|date=August 17, 2006|author=Pat Corcoran|title=Duckworth calls for investigation of foreign spending since 9/11|url=http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060821081045/http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

On September 30, 2006, Duckworth gave the Democratic Party's response to President [[George W. Bush]]'s weekly radio address. In it, she was critical of Bush's strategy for the Iraq War.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Biemer|first1=John|title=Duckworth: Bush has slogans, not strategies on Iraq|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-10-01/news/0610010342_1_tammy-duckworth-iraq-radio-address|accessdate=May 9, 2016|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=October 1, 2006}}</ref>

In October 2006, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' reported that Duckworth agreed with General [[Sir Richard Dannatt]], the [[British Army]] chief, that the presence of coalition troops was exacerbating the conflict in Iraq.<ref name="times_leads_charge">Sarah Baxter [http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,2089-2415686,00.html "War heroine leads Democrat charge"], ''The Sunday Times'', October 22, 2006.</ref>

Duckworth was rated by the [[National Rifle Association]] as having a pro-[[gun law in the United States|gun control]] congressional voting record.<ref name="OTI1004g">{{cite web|title=Tammy Duckworth on Gun Control|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/Domestic/Tammy_Duckworth_Gun_Control.htm|website=On The Issues|accessdate=October 4, 2017}}</ref> Duckworth, who is a gun owner herself, cites violence in Chicago as a major influence for her support of gun reform.

Duckworth participated in the 2016 [[Chris Murphy gun control filibuster]].

In a 2016 interview with ''[[GQ]]'' magazine, Duckworth stated that gaining control of the Senate and "closing the gap" in the House would be necessary in order to pass common sense gun laws. She also stated that she believed moderate Republicans, who support common sense gun reform, would have more power to influence gun reform if they were not "pushed aside by those folks who are absolutely beholden to the NRA. And so we never get the vote."<ref name="Nelson1004g"/>

In response to the [[2017 Las Vegas shooting]], Duckworth stated that "My heart goes out to the victims of the tragic shooting in Las Vegas last night and their loved ones.
