In 2000, Davis challenged three-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Brian Bilbray]] in what was then the 49th District, winning with 50 percent of the vote. Her district was renumbered the 53rd District after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] redistricting. She has been reelected six times without much difficulty. She is the first [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to represent what is now the 53rd district for more than one term in over half a century.  The only other Democrat to represent this district since the [[Harry Truman]] administration, [[Lynn Schenk]], was toppled by Bilbray in the [[Republican Revolution|1994 Republican wave]].

Davis has introduced a federal version of the California OB/Gyn law she authored at the start of every Congress since she was elected.  Provisions of her OB/Gyn bill were included in the [[Affordable Care Act|health care reform bill]] enacted into law.
