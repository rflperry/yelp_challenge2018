==Early life, education and career==

Thompson was born in [[St. Helena, California]], the son of Beverly Ann (n√©e Forni) and Charles Edward Thompson. His father had English ancestry and his mother was of mostly Italian and some Swiss descent.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/thompsonm.htm</ref> He was educated at [[California State University, Chico]], served in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]] with the [[United States Army]]'s [[173rd Airborne Brigade]],<ref>{{cite web|url= http://mikethompson.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=235 |title=Thompson Honored for His Dedication to Veterans |date=2008-04-03 |accessdate=2008-12-15 |publisher=Office of Congressman Mike Thompson |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730202030/http://mikethompson.house.gov/PRArticle.aspx?NewsID=235 <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-30}}</ref> was a [[vineyard]] owner and maintenance supervisor, taught [[Public Administration]] and [[State Government]] at [[San Francisco State University]] and [[California State University, Chico]], and was a member of the [[California State Senate]] before entering the House.<ref name=votesmart />

==Early political career==
Thompson served as an aide to Democrat [[Jackie Speier]] (then a [[California State Assembly|state Assemblywoman]]) before winning election to the [[California State Senate]] in 1990.  He very narrowly unseated [[California's 4th State Senate district|4th district]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent [[Jim Nielsen]] after Nielsen's reputation took a hit following a series of ethical missteps;<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsreview.com/chico/Content?oid=654749 |title=Is Nielsen fudging again? |date=2008-04-17 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |publisher=[[News & Review|Chico News & Review]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.newsreview.com/chico/Content?oid=667938 |title=Semi-super Tuesday |date=2008-05-29 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |publisher=[[News & Review|Chico News & Review]]}}</ref> Thompson's margin of victory was less than 1 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/90_gen_sov.pdf |title=Statement of Vote - General Election November 6, 1990 |date=1990-10-09 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730220109/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/90_gen_sov.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-30}} Under "Fourth Senatorial District" on 40th page of this PDF file.</ref>

Following the 1992 general election, Democratic state Senator [[Barry Keene]] of the neighboring [[California's 2nd State Senate district|2nd District]] resigned.  Thompson, whose hometown of [[St. Helena, California|St. Helena]] had shifted from the 4th district and into the 2nd district after [[reapportionment]], decided to run in the 1993 [[special election]] for Keene's seat.  He narrowly beat Republican businesswoman Margie Handley but won easy reelection in 1994.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/1994_general/sov_94_gen_complete.pdf |title=Statement of Vote - November 8, 1994 General Election |date=1994-12-16 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |publisher=[[Secretary of State of California|California Secretary of State]] |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080730213903/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/1994_general/sov_94_gen_complete.pdf <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-07-30}} Under "2nd State Senate District" on 69th page of this PDF file.</ref>

Thompson was approached by national Democrats about running for Congress in 1996 against freshman Republican [[Frank Riggs]], but he declined, believing his senate [[seniority]] would be more beneficial to his district than would his being a [[freshman]] congressman.  In 1998, however, Thompson was due to be termed out of the state senate, and opted to run against Riggs after all.  Riggs opted to retire, believing that he faced almost certain defeat given Thompson's name recognition and reputation.<ref>{{cite news|url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/archive/junkie110298.htm |title=Political Junkie |author=Ken Rudin |date=1998-11-02 |accessdate=2008-12-12 |publisher=[[The Washington Post|Washingtonpost.com]]}}</ref> Thompson won handily.  He has been reelected seven times with no substantive opposition, and has turned what was a swing district for most of the 1980s and 1990s into a fairly safe Democratic seat.

For his first seven terms, Thompson represented a district stretching from the far northern portion of the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] all the way to the [[North Coast (California)|North Coast]].  However, his district was renumbered as the 5th district after the 2010 census and was made somewhat more compact, losing most of its  northern portion to the [[California's 2nd congressional district|2nd district]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Thompson is a [[Blue Dog Democrat]] and was previously a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]]. He has been labeled as a "moderate Democratic leader".<ref name="Thompson GovTrack">{{cite web|title=Rep. Michael "Mike" Thompson|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/c_thompson/400403|publisher=[[GovTrack]]|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref> Thompson has voted with the Democratic party 91% of the time.<ref name="Thompson Votes Database">{{cite news|title=Mike Thompson (D)|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/T000460|work=The U.S. Congress Votes Database|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=23 July 2012}}</ref>

;Abortion
Although Thompson is a [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]],<ref name=votesmart /> he is [[pro-choice]]. In May 2004, he, along with 47 other Catholic Democratic Congressmembers, sent a letter to [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Theodore McCarrick]] of [[Washington, D.C.]] to dissuade him from refusing to administer [[Eucharist in the Catholic Church|Holy Communion]] to Catholic Congressmembers who practice pro-choice legislative voting.<ref name=CNN-2004-05-21>{{cite news |url= http://www.cnn.com/2004/ALLPOLITICS/05/20/catholic.legislators/ |title=Legislators protest communion recommendation |accessdate=2008-12-16 |author= |date=2004-05-21 |publisher= [[CNN|CNN.com]]}}</ref> [[Judie Brown]], president of the pro-life [[American Life League]], issued a response to the letter saying that it is harmful to the Catholic Church to "[perpetuate] the lie that you can be a Catholic in good standing and support abortion."<ref name=CNN-2004-05-21 /> In February 2006, Thompson was one of 55 Democratic Representatives who were Catholic who signed a "Statement of Principles," which affirmed a commitment to their faith, but said that they disagreed with their church on some issues. They stated that on those issues, such as [[abortion rights]], they would follow their conscience instead of their [[Dogma (Roman Catholic)|church's teachings]].<ref>

McCarrick]], and Bishop [[Nicholas Anthony DiMarzio|Nicholas DiMarzio]] |date=2006-03-10 |publisher= [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]]}}</ref>

;Health care
Thompson has been a supporter of a public option for healthcare. In 2009, Thompson wrote that "[b]y streamlining health care, reducing fraud and abuse, ending unnecessary testing, discouraging over-utilization, investing in smart reforms, and emphasizing preventive health care, we can significantly bring down the cost of health care."<ref name="Can't Wait">{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Mike|title=Health Care Can't Wait|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-mike-thompson/health-care-cant-wait_b_213961.html|accessdate=23 July 2012|newspaper=[[Huffington Post]]|date=10 June 2009}}</ref>

;Foreign policy
In late 2002, Thompson joined Democratic Reps. [[Jim McDermott]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] and [[David Bonior]] of [[Michigan]] on a fact-finding trip to [[Iraq]]. During the trip, the lawmakers spoke to officials in [[Baghdad]] and residents in [[Basra]].  Presciently, they expressed skepticism about the [[Presidency of George W. Bush|Bush administration]]'s claims that [[Saddam]] was stockpiling [[weapons of mass destruction]].<ref>

On March 26, 2008, Muthanna Al-Hanooti, an official of a [[Michigan]] [[Charitable organization|charity]], was accused of underwriting three members of Congress to travel to [[Iraq]], on behalf of Iraqi intelligence officials.  McDermott's office was already organizing the trip when the charity offered to pay trip expenses.  McDermott's spokesman stated that the charity was fully vetted by the U.S. government. He also stated that the congressmen obtained a license from the [[State Department]]'s [[Office of Foreign Assets Control]] for the group to travel to Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004311506_mcdermott28m.html |title=The story behind McDermott's controversial Iraq trip |accessdate=2008-12-15 |author=David Postman |date=2008-03-28 |publisher= [[The Seattle Times]]}}</ref>

;2008 presidential election
During the 2008 presidential campaign, Thompson endorsed former [[U.S. Senator]] [[Hillary Rodham Clinton]] (D-[[New York]]) for President; his district, however, was narrowly won by [[Barack Obama]].

;Environmental issues
The [[League of Conservation Voters]] publishes the [http://www.lcv.org/scorecard National Environmental Scorecard] for each session of Congress which rates how members voted on key energy and environmental issues.  Mike Thompson was rated 92% (with 100% being the highest possible rating) for the 2nd session of the 110th Congress.  His LCV Scorecard ratings have been at 90% or above for every session of Congress since 2001.

Thompson was endorsed for re-election in 2008 by the Humane USA PAC, a [[political action committee]] founded by leaders of animal rights groups such as [[Humane Society of the United States|The Humane Society of the United States]], The Fund for Animals, [[American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals]], the [[Doris Day Animal League]], the [[Animal Welfare Institute]], [[Farm Sanctuary]] and The Ark Trust.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.humaneusa.org/humaneusaendorsements.htm#CA|title=Humane USA 2008 Endorsements|publisher=Humane USA PAC|accessdate=17 January 2010|location=Washington, DC}}</ref>

In March 2012, Thompson, along with Assemblyman Jarred Huffman, voiced his opposition to a piece of water legislation that the House would be voting on, which he argued would "kill local jobs, ignore 20 years of established science and overturn a century of California water law."<ref name="20 years">{{cite news|title=GUEST OPINION: House bill would turn back environmental law clock 20 years|url=http://www.watchsonomacounty.com/2012/03/sacramento/guest-opinion-house-bill-would-turn-back-environmental-law-clock-20-years/|newspaper=The Press Democrat}}</ref>
