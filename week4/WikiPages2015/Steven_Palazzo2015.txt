==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Mississippi, 2010#District 4}}
Palazzo entered the Republican primary for [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district]] and won the nomination with 57% of the vote. He faced 10-term Democratic incumbent [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] in the general election. Although the 4th has turned almost solidly Republican at the federal level, Taylor had held the seat without serious difficulty. His voting record had been very conservative even by [[Mississippi Democratic Party|Mississippi Democratic]] standards, and he'd often broken with his party. Palazzo established himself as Taylor's strongest opponent since 1996. In particular, he attacked Taylor for supporting [[Nancy Pelosi]] for House Speaker in 2006 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/44119.html|title=Taylor: I voted for McCain - Jessica Taylor|publisher=Politico.Com|accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref> He was endorsed by [[Sarah Palin]] and in the November 2010 general election, Palazzo defeated Taylor 52%-47%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=496790</ref>

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Mississippi, 2012#District 4}}
In the Republican primary, he defeated two challengers with 74% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=751580</ref> In the November election, he defeated Democratic candidate Matthew Moore 64%-29%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=724373</ref>

;2014
In the Republican primary, Palazzo defeated four challengers in the primary, including Gene Taylor, a Democrat-turned-Republican who served 22 year in Congress before Palazzo beat him in 2010. Palazzo won 50.5% of the vote while Taylor won 43% of the vote. Three minor candidates made up the reamianing percentage. Taylor actively campaigned and drew large numbers of Democrats into the Republican Primary.  <ref>http://msbusiness.com/blog/2014/06/05/palazzo-defeats-taylor-4th-congressional-district-primary/</ref>

Palazzo will now face Democrat challenger Matthew Moore who he defeated 64%-29% in 2012.
