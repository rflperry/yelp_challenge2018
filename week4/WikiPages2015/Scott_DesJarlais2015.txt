==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
====2010====
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2010#District 4*}}

In 2009, DesJarlais—who had never run for elected office before—filed papers to challenge Democratic incumbent [[Lincoln Davis]],<ref>[http://www.tennessean.com/article/20090820/NEWS0206/908200369/Entrenched+Democrats+are+a+challenge+to+GOP ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> as well as Independents Paul H.

====2012====
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2012#District 4}}
DesJarlais was challenged by Democratic nominee and [[Tennessee Senate|state senator]] [[Eric Stewart (Tennessee politician)|Eric Stewart]]. Prior to the 2012 election, the Fourth District was significantly altered as a result of redistricting.  Notably, [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], formerly the heart of the 6th District, was shifted into the 4th. The redrawn 4th contains about half of the constituents who resided in the former 4th district, with 14 of 24 counties being moved elsewhere by redistricting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Michael |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/jan/15/desjarlais-has-to-scramble-with-new-district/ |title=DesJarlais has to scramble with new district alignment » Knoxville News Sentinel |publisher=Knoxnews.com |date=2012-10-26 |accessdate=2012-10-30}}</ref>  For a time, it was thought that DesJarlais would face a primary challenge from state senator [[Bill Ketron]], a Murfreesboro resident and the chairman of the state senate redistricting committee.  However, Ketron decided that he wouldn't run.

During the election campaigns, events from DesJarlais' personal life became public, making the 2012 race against Stewart "one of the ugliest Tennessee congressional races in decades".<ref name="freepress2012">{{cite news|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2012/nov/07/chattanooga-scott-desjarlais-holds-lead/|title=Scott DesJarlais holds lead (with video) |first=Andy Sher|date=November 7, 2012|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|accessdate=10 November 2012}}</ref>  Stories that surfaced included the fact that during the divorce proceedings, DesJarlais' first wife Susan had alleged that her ex-husband engaged in "violent and threatening behavior".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2010/09/16/papers-from-desjarlais-bitter-divorce-pop-up-in-media|title=Papers from DesJarlais' Bitter Divorce Pop Up in Media|first=Jeff|last=Woods|publisher=National Scene|date=September 16, 2010}}</ref> Court filings revealed that he had at least four affairs.<ref>Scott DesJarlais' Second Mistress: Another Woman Claims Affair With Tennessee Congressman, by Michael McAuliff, Huffington Post, 28 October 2012</ref>  One was with a female patient.

In October 2012, the non-profit group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] requested that the Tennessee Department of Health investigate evidence that DesJarlais had a sexual relationship with a patient, an allegation that could open the congressman to disciplinary action for potentially violating medical ethics.<ref>{{cite news | first = Chas | last = Sisk | title = Rep.

====2014====
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2014#District 4}}

DesJarlais is considered one of the most vulnerable Congressmen, because of revelations in October 2012 that he had prescribed drugs to a patient with whom he was having an affair and had pressured his former wife and former mistress to have several abortions. He was re-elected in 2012 with a reduced majority.<ref name=flush>{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/desjarlais-primary-challenger-flush-with-cash-for-2014/|title=DesJarlais Primary Challenger Flush With Cash for 2014|date=January 27, 2014|accessdate=January 28, 2014|work=Roll Call|author=Emily Cahn}}</ref> Despite these vulnerabilities, in the final days before the August 7 primary DesJarlais seems to have a chance at holding onto his seat, according to Republican operatives who think voters have forgiven his behavior.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Cahn|first1=Emily|title=Scott DesJarlais’ Re-Election Hopes Rise, Despite Abortion Scandal|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/scott-desjarlais-re-election-hopes-surge/?dcz=emailalert|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=31 July 2014}}</ref>

[[Tennessee Senate|State Senator]] [[Jim Tracy (politician)|Jim Tracy]] was challenging DesJarlais in the primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/jan/03/tracy-kicks-off-campaign-to-take-on/|title=Tracy kicks off campaign to take on DesJarlais|date=January 3, 2013|accessdate=January 6, 2013|work=[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]|first=Andy|last=Sher}}</ref> As of the end of June 2013, Tracy had raised nearly $750,000 (including over $300,000 in the second quarter of 2013) for his bid.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/desjarlais-challenger-posts-major-fundraising-haul/|title=DesJarlais Challenger Posts Big Fundraising Haul #TN04|date=July 10, 2013|accessdate=July 11, 2013|work=Roll Call|first=Kyle|last=Trygstad}}</ref> He raised an additional $150,000 in the fourth quarter and reported $840,000 cash-on-hand.<ref name=flush/> By contrast, at the end of September, DesJarlais reported $170,000 cash-on-hand.<ref name=flush/> DesJarlais won the primary by a margin of 38 votes. Tracy decided not to challenge the results, despite citing irregularities.

==Personal life==
DesJarlais and his second wife, Amy, have three children.  They live in [[Jasper, Tennessee|Jasper]], a town about 30 miles west of [[Chattanooga]], in [[Marion County, Tennessee|Marion County]]. DesJarlais divorced his first wife, Susan, in 2001; they have one child.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/56_25/politics/49880-1.html |title=Old Divorce File Riles Tennessee |publisher=Roll Call |date=2010-09-16 |accessdate=2010-10-11}}</ref>

On November 15, 2012—two weeks after the election—the ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'' obtained a transcript of DesJarlais' 2001 divorce proceeding with his first wife.  It revealed that DesJarlais had admitted under oath to at least six sexual relationships with people he came in contact with while chief of staff at Grandview Medical Center in Jasper.  Among them were at least two patients.  The state Democratic Party had fought to get the transcript released before the election, but the transcript—which ran to 679 typed pages—was not complete at the time.  The transcript also revealed that contrary to his staunch anti-abortion stance as a congressman, he had counseled his then-wife to have two abortions and pressured one of the patients with whom he'd had an affair to get an abortion.  Additional transcripts revealed that he had prescribed pain pills to at least one patient with whom he'd had an affair—a clear conflict of interest.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/11/15/scott-desjarlais-approved_n_2140171.html |title=Scott DesJarlais Approved Wife's Abortion, Slept With Coworkers, Patients, Court Records Say  |author= Michael McAuliff |date=2012-11-16 |accessdate=2012-12-25 |work=Huffington Post}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.timesfreepress.com/news/2013/may/24/desjarlais-fined-for-sex-with-2-patients/ |title=U.S. Rep.
