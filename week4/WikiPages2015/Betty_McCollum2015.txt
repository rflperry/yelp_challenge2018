She is a member of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party|Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL).

McCollum's district centers on [[St. Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]], Minnesota's capital city. She is the second woman elected to Congress from Minnesota.

==Early life, education and career==
McCollum was born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]. She has two younger siblings, Anthony and Monica. McCollum is divorced and has two children. She graduated from the [[College of St. Catherine]] in [[St. Paul, Minnesota]] in 1976. McCollum has worked as a high school social sciences teacher and as a sales manager. She first got involved in politics in 1986, when her daughter got hurt on a slide in a [[North St. Paul, Minnesota|North St. Paul]] city park. When the city council wouldn't do anything to fix the slide, McCollum's neighbors encouraged her to run for a spot on the council herself. She won that November and served three terms.<ref>{{cite web| title = Campaign 2004| publisher = Minnesota Public Radio| url =http://minnesota.publicradio.org/collections/special/2004/campaign/congress/mccollum| accessdate = 2007-02-26}}</ref> She then challenged longtime [[Minnesota House of Representatives|state representative]] Rich O'Conner in the DFL primary and won an upset victory.  She went on to serve four terms in the state house.

McCollum received a 91% [[Progressivism|progressive]] rating from a self-described non-partisan group that provides a "searchable database of Congressional voting records from a Progressive perspective"<ref>{{cite web|title =Leading with the Left|publisher =Progressive Punch|url =http://www.progressivepunch.org|accessdate = 2006-11-02}}</ref> and scored a 13% [[Conservatism|conservative]] rating by the conservative group, SBE Council.<ref>{{cite web|title =Congressional Voting Scorecard 2005| work =SBE Council’s Congressional Voting Scorecard 2005| publisher =Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council| date = June 2006| url =http://www.sbecouncil.org/uploads/Ratings2005Scorecard.pdf| format =PDF|accessdate =2006-11-02}}</ref>

Representative McCollum has supported the interests of Pro-Choice interest groups such as Planned Parenthood, National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association, and NARAL Pro-Choice America.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=3812 |title=Betty McCollum: Interest Group Rating |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> Most of these groups have the same main goals. One example would be the National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association which aims to provide access to “family planning and reproductive health care services and to support reproductive freedom for all”.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=1630 |title=National Special Interest Groups |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> She indicated on the 2002 National Political Awareness Test that she believed abortions should always be legally available, but only within the first trimester of pregnancy.<ref name="votesmart1">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=3812#409 |title=Betty McCollum - Political Courage Test |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

The entire time Representative McCollum has been in office, she has supported gay civil rights.<ref name="votesmart2">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?category=76&go.x=10&go.y=8&can_id=3812&type=category |title=National Special Interest Groups |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> The Human Rights Campaign is America’s largest civil rights organization working to achieve lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender equality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/about_us/index.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Human Rights Campaign |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> They have continually approved of her voting record.<ref name="votesmart2"/> In one speech opposing the proposed [[Federal Marriage Amendment]], she stated, "Gay and lesbian Americans are citizens who must never be treated as second class citizens".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=153038&keyword=gay&phrase=&contain= |title=Public Statements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

She has supported organizations such as the Alliance for Retired Americans and the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, who share the mission to ensure social and economic justice and full civil rights for all citizens so that they may enjoy lives of dignity, personal and family fulfillment and security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=713 |title=National Special Interest Groups |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>
In a position paper, Representative McCollum defended her position on Social Security. She stated, "We can secure the future of Social Security with common sense and a shared, bipartisan commitment to economic security and fiscal responsibility for all Americans. This is my commitment, and you can count on me to work to protect Social Security and to find a solution that truly protects the retirement security of every American." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=402196&keyword=&phrase=&contain= |title=Public Statements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

McCollum advocates shifting America's energy consumption to cleaner, non carbon based sources. McCollum, along with [[Al Franken]], and [[Kit Bond]] presented Congress with the Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act. The plan would utilize thermal energy sources and create renewable energy production tax credits.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mccollum.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=994&Itemid= |title=Franken, Bond, McCollum Introduce Thermal Renewable Energy and Efficiency Act |publisher=Mccollum.house.gov |date=July 21, 2010 |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref> She also voted in favor of [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|American Recovery and Reinvestment]] in 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://mccollum.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=49&Itemid=77 |title=Energy |publisher=Mccollum.house.gov |date= |accessdate=January 15, 2012}}</ref>

In 2004, McCollum gained national visibility when she and fellow Democrat, [[Jim McDermott]] of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] called for [[United States Secretary of Education|Secretary of Education]] [[Rod Paige]] to resign for claiming the [[National Education Association]] was "a terrorist organization."

McCollum made headlines in February 2011 when she voted to end military sponsorship of NASCAR teams. The amendment failed 148-241.  She also introduced an amendments in June, 2011 and 2012 to [[Political debates about United States military bands|cut funding for military bands]] by $125 million, a proposal opposed by the [[Fleet Reserve Association]] and described by the [[National Association for Music Education]] as "potentially devastating."<ref>{{cite news |first=Carol Ann |last=Alaimo |title=At Ft.

McCollum opposes Conceal-and-Carry legislation, and in November 2011 she voted against Right-to-Carry reciprocity.<ref name="votesmart1"/>

==Controversies==
On October 5, she omitted the phrase "Under God" from the pledge during a House session. The video of the session quickly became viral and her omission was interpreted as being intentional.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wallbank |first=Derek |url=http://www.minnpost.com/derekwallbank/2010/10/26/22726/mccollum_taking_fire_over_omitting_under_god_in_2002_pledge_of_allegiance |title=D.C.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Minnesota, 2012#District 4}}
After 4th District Representative [[Bruce Vento]] decided not to seek a 13th term due to illness in 2000 (he died before the election), McCollum won the DFL nomination to succeed him. The district is heavily Democratic (among Minnesota congressional districts, only the neighboring 5th District is considered more Democratic), and Democrats have held the seat since 1949. McCollum's main concern in winning office thus wasn't her [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent, State Senator [[Linda Runbeck]], but [[Independence Party of Minnesota|Independence Party]] candidate Tom Foley. Foley had previously been county attorney for [[Ramsey County, Minnesota|Ramsey County]] (almost all of which is in the 4th District) as a Democrat. Many thought that Foley could siphon off enough votes from McCollum to allow Runbeck to sneak up the middle and end the long run of Democratic dominance in the district. But in the end, McCollum defeated Runbeck by a 17-point margin, with Foley in a distant third place. Foley managed to hold McCollum to 48 percent of the vote, making her the only Democrat not to win at least 50 percent of the vote since Democrats began their present dominance in the district. The district has since reverted to form, and McCollum has been reelected seven times without serious opposition.

In 2008, McCollum endorsed Barack Obama for president.
