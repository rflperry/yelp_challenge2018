==Works==
*Linda Sánchez, Loretta Sánchez and Richard Buskin, ''Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress'', Grand Central Publishing (September 2, 2008) ISBN 978-0-446-50804-9, foreword by [[Nancy Pelosi]]

In 2008 sister congresswomen Loretta Sanchez and Linda Sanchez published the joint memoir ''Dream in Color: How the Sanchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.amazon.com/dp/0446508047 |title=Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress (9780446508049): Linda Sánchez, Loretta Sánchez, Richard Buskin, Nancy Pelosi: Books |publisher=Amazon.com |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed the book and wrote: "Linda and Loretta Sanchez present their compelling story—noteworthy not only for their history-making achievements (including first sisters or women of any relation to serve together in Congress, first woman and person of color to represent a district in Orange County, first Latina on the House Judiciary Committee and first Head Start child to be elected to Congress) but also for its “American Dream” aspect—their parents immigrated from Mexico and despite lacking a formal education managed to send their seven children to college. Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoir—perhaps because these two women are not typical politicians."<ref>[http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6567674.html]{{dead link|date=July 2010}}</ref>

On a letter written on February 9, 2010 to President [[Barack Obama]], then-Speaker of the House [[Nancy Pelosi]], Senator [[Charles Schumer]], Sánchez explained how "Currently, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents may sponsor their spouses (and other immediate family members) for immigration purposes. But, same-sex partners committed to spending their lives together are not recognized as "families" under U.S. immigration law and thus do not have this same right." and how "This is unacceptable, and we believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must include a strong family reunification component inclusive of LGBT families."<ref>[votesmart.org/public-statement/483699/#.UM5IDPUZxnA]</ref>
