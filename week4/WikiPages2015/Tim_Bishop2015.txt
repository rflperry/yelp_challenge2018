===Ethics investigation===

In September 2013, the [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] recommended further review of an August 2012 incident in which Bishop was accused of soliciting a campaign contribution from hedge fund magnate Eric Semler in exchange for acting in an official capacity to obtain a fireworks permit for Semler's son's bar mitzvah on Long Island.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=31A7F69E-DC2A-4368-8B7F-6D04EBE3B042 |title=Tim Bishop’s bar mitzvah episode could spell trouble |first=John |last=Bresnahan |date=15 August 2012 |publisher=Politico |accessdate=21 March 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Rattray|first=David|title=Committee Will Extend Bishop Probe|url=http://easthamptonstar.com/News/2013919/Committee-Will-Extend-Bishop-Probe|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Easthampton Star|date=19 September 2013}}</ref> Bishop has denied the allegations as "outrageous, unfounded attacks on my character and my family".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/local/explosive_charges_vs_li_pol_IgDJ21pUgrvSQeqisWKrCI?utm_medium=rss&utm_content=Local |title=Explosive charges vs. LI pol |first=Geoff |last=Earle |date=August 17, 2012 |publisher=New York Post |accessdate=30 August 2012}}</ref> After the incident was picked up by the media, Semler called the allegations a "nonstory" and said that, "Tim never said anything to me about a donation. I didn’t know he was running for re-election. After the fact, after I got the permit, I did receive a request for a donation. He didn’t tell me, one of his campaign people told me, that he was in a hot race and needed a lot of support. I would love to support a guy like that. There was never a discussion of a contribution while he was trying to help me. He never asked me for money.
