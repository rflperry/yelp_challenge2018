The election was held on August 8, 2006, with Lamborn defeating Crank and four other candidates to win the party nomination in a contentious six-way race. Hefley was incensed at the tactics used in the election, particularly a mailed brochure from the Christian Coalition of Colorado associating Crank with "public support for members and efforts of the homosexual agenda." Hefley said that he "suspected, but couldn't prove, collusion between Lamborn's campaign, which is managed by Jon Hotaling, and the Christian Coalition of Colorado, which is run by Hotaling's brother, Mark." <ref name="RMN-20060908">{{cite news | last=Foster |first=Dick | title=Hefley denies damage: Refusal to support Lamborn won't hurt GOP, he says | publisher=Rocky Mountain News | date=September 8, 2006 | url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_4976588,00.html}}

===Tenure===
An office of the [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agency was established in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in Lamborn's district. The office opened in February 2009 and increased immigration enforcement agents in the area from two to ten. “The immediate need is to address those that have committed a crime and make sure they’re sent out of the country,” Lamborn said. However this would not place in jeopardy employers who hire illegal immigrants in the first place or who pay these workers without any withholding tax or below the [[minimum wage]].<ref>[http://www.gazette.com/articles/immigration_32122___article.html/office_illegal.html ICE Office, More Agents Slated For Springs].

Lamborn is one of the House Republicans leading the effort against public funding for the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and NPR ([[National Public Radio]]). "I have been seeking to push [[Big Bird]] out of the nest for over a year, based on the simple fact that we can no longer afford to spend taxpayer dollars on nonessential government programs. It's time for Big Bird to earn his wings and learn to fly on his own."

On August 24, 2007, Jonathan Bartha, who works for Focus on the Family (headquartered in Colorado Springs), and his wife Anna wrote a letter to the editor in a community newspaper expressing concerns about Lamborn's opposition to more restrictions on dog fighting. They were also concerned that he'd taken several campaign contributions from the gaming industry. A few days later, Lamborn left two voice mails threatening "consequences" if they didn't renounce their "blatantly false" letter. He also said that he would be "forced to take other steps" if the matter wasn't resolved "on a Scriptural level." The Barthas were shocked by the messages, and Anna Bartha called Lamborn's behavior "not anything we would ever anticipate an elected official would pursue."<ref>{{cite news|title=Lamborn message has couple in dismay|url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_6782060|publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=4 August 2011|first=Erin|last=Emery|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref>

;"Tar Baby" Remark
On July 29, 2011, Lamborn appeared on a Denver radio program to discuss the debt crisis and the failure of Democrats and Republicans to reach a compromise on the problem. Lamborn stated "Now, I don't even want to have to be associated with [President Obama]. It's like touching a tar baby and you get it, you're stuck, and you're a part of the problem now and you can't get away."<ref>{{cite web|title=Doug Lamborn Tar Baby|url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URAAfREIRGA|work=http://www.youtube.com}}</ref> The term [[tar baby]] is sometimes considered to be a racial slur used towards [[African-Americans]]. Former Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll, himself an African-American, replied "“Looking beyond the fact that Congressman Lamborn’s entire comment is nonsensical, his use of the term ‘tar baby’ is unfortunate because [of] the historical connotation of that term when used in conjunction with African Americans."<ref>{{cite web|title=GOP REP.

On August 1, 2011, Lamborn apologized for his use of the slur, explaining ""When I said 'tar baby', I was talking economic quagmire that our country is finding ourselves in because of poor economic policy from the White House.

On January 23, 2012, Lamborn announced he would not be attending the President's State of the Union address. According to his spokeswoman Catherine Mortenson, "Congressman Lamborn is doing this to send a clear message that he does not support the policies of Barack Obama, that they have hurt our country," and he believed Obama was “in full campaign mode and will use the address as an opportunity to bash his political opponents."<ref>{{cite web|title=Doug Lamborn to ditch State of the Union speech as a protest|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71833.html|work=http://www.politico.com}}</ref>
