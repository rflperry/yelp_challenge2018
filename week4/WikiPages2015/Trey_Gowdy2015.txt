In 2014, Gowdy became chairman of [[United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi|a House Select Committee to investigate]] the [[2012 Benghazi attack]].

==Early life, education, and family==
Gowdy was born in Greenville, and grew up in Spartanburg. He considers Spartanburg his home.  He is the son of Novalene (née Evans) and Dr. Harold Watson "Hal" Gowdy, Jr.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.spartanburgcounty.org/govt/depts/sol/tgbio.htm |title=Circuit Solicitor: Trey Gowdy Bio |publisher=Spartanburgcounty.org |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/gowdy.htm |title=Harold Watson "Trey" Gowdy III |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Trey graduated from [[Spartanburg High School]] in 1982.  He earned a B.A. in history from [[Baylor University]] in 1986.  He was a member of Kappa Omega Tau, a service/social Fraternity while at Baylor University.  He earned a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from the [[University of South Carolina School of Law]] in 1989.  In law school, he was a member of the scholastic honor society "Wig and Robe."

Gowdy and his wife Terri have two children: Watson and Abigail. Watson is a senior at Clemson University studying Philosophy, Political Science, and Law, as well as a lifelong avid golf enthusiast. Abigail is a 12th grader. His cousin [[Joey Paul Gowdy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1053961/bio?ref_=nm_ov_bio_sm|title=Joey Paul Gowdy: Biography|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> is an [[actor]] and producer in the [[entertainment]] business who is related to sportcaster [[Curt Gowdy]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0332954/bio|title=Curt Gowdy: Biography|accessdate=May 9, 2014}}</ref> and actress Karen Morris Gowdy.  Terri Dillard Gowdy is a teacher's aide in Spartanburg School District.

==Legal career==
Following law school, he clerked for [[John P. Gardner]] on the [[South Carolina Court of Appeals]] and United States District Court Judge [[George Ross Anderson, Jr.|Ross Anderson]]. He then went into private practice before becoming a federal prosecutor in April 1994. He was awarded the Postal Inspector’s Award for the successful prosecution of [[J. Mark Allen]], one of “[[America’s Most Wanted]]” suspects.

In February 2000, he left the United States Attorney’s Office to run for 7th Circuit Solicitor. He defeated incumbent Solicitor Holman Gossett<ref>{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Janet S. |url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_AcoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=288EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3122,6036649&dq=trey+gowdy&hl=en |title=Gowdy spins web campaign |publisher=Herald-Journal |date=April 29, 2000 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> in the Republican primary.  No other party even put up a candidate, ensuring his election in November.   He was reelected in 2004 and 2008, both times unopposed. During his tenure, he appeared on “[[Forensic Files]]” twice, as well as [[Dateline NBC]] and [[South Carolina Educational Television|SCETV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treygowdy.com/meet-trey/ |title=Meet Trey |publisher=Trey Gowdy |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> He prosecuted the full gamut of criminal cases including 7 death penalty cases.

When the state faced a budget crunch that forced many employees to go on unpaid furloughs, Gowdy funneled part of his campaign account into the solicitor's budget so his staff could keep working.<ref name=CQ>[http://innovation.cq.com/newmember/2010elexnguide.pdf Congressional Quarterly Guide to the New Congress], 2010</ref>

==Congressional elections==

===2010===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2010#District 4*}}
In the summer of 2009, Gowdy announced that he would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Bob Inglis]] in the Republican primary for {{ushr|South Carolina|4}}. Inglis, who got a 93% lifetime rating from the [[American Conservative Union]], angered the [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative wing of the Republican Party]] by taking stances that were perceived to be more moderate than those he'd taken when he'd first represented the district from 1993 to 1999.<ref name="pol090407">{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Kraushaar|title=Inglis faces fight from the right |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0409/20974.html|work=[[Politico.com]]|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}</ref>  For instance, he'd angered conservatives in his district when he supported [[cap and trade]] as a result of his belief that [[global warming]] is [[Attribution of recent climate change|man made]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Seitz-Wald |first=Alex |url=http://thinkprogress.org/politics/2010/11/18/131040/inglis-gop-global-warming/?mobile=nc |title=Republican Rep.

Like most of the challengers, Gowdy ran well to Inglis' right.<ref name="pol090407"/> In the June 2010 primary, Gowdy ranked first with 39% of the vote, short of the 50% majority threshold to win outright and avoid a run-off. Inglis received 27% of the vote. Jim Lee got 14%, State Senator [[David L. Thomas]] got 13%, and former [[Historian of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Christina Jeffrey]] was last with 7% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487675 |title=SC District 4 - R Primary Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>McArdle, John.

===2012===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2012 #District 4}}
Gowdy ran for reelection to a second term against Democrat Deb Morrow.<ref>[http://taylors.patch.com/articles/deb-morrow-seeks-democratic-nod-for-congress ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref>  The original remap of the district cut part of Gowdy's home county, Spartanburg County, out of the district while leaving all of Greenville County in the district.  Gowdy was initially "disappointed" with this version, even though it would have left the 4th as reliably Republican as its predecessor.  However, the final map moved part of Greenville County to the 3rd and left all of Spartanburg County in the 4th.  Gowdy was pleased with this version, since Greenville and Spartanburg counties remained together. [[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]] rated his district as ''Safe Republican'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Joshua |url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_18/Race-Ratings-GOP-Strengthens-Grip-on-South-Carolina-207940-1.html |title=Race Ratings: GOP Strengthens Grip on South Carolina |publisher=Roll Call |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Gowdy won re-election to a second term, defeating Morrow 65%-34%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/SC |title=2014 Election Results Senate: Live Map by State, Midterm Midterm Races Races |publisher=Politico |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

===2014===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2014 #District 4}}
Gowdy ran for reelection again in 2014. His only opponent was Libertarian Curtis E.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
In August 2011 during the [[2011 United States debt ceiling crisis]], Gowdy opposed Speaker [[John Boehner]]’s debt limit bill, and he voted against the final debt ceiling agreement.<ref name="More from Boehner">{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Jake|title=Right wants more from John Boehner|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76258.html|accessdate=June 2, 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=May 13, 2012}}</ref>  He also opposed the 2011 defense authorization bill, citing concerns about the prospect of Americans being detained without trial on national security grounds.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brady |first=Jessica |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/detainee_provisions_still_cause_concern-211283-1.html |title=Detainee Provisions Still Cause for Concern |publisher=Roll Call |date=December 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> In December 2010, he told [[Congressional Quarterly]] that he would support a measure only if its sponsor could demonstrate that the Constitution gave the government the power to act in a particular realm.<ref name=CQ/>

Gowdy worked on the Committee on Judiciary, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Gowdy frequently speaks on the floor of the House on issues ranging from Fast and Furious to his support for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

In 2012, he received the ''Defender of Economic Freedom'' award from the fiscally conservative [[501(c) organization|501(c)4]] organization [[Club for Growth]]. The award is given to the members of Congress who have the year's highest ranking, according to the Club for Growth's metrics. Gowdy scored 97 out of 100, and was one of 34 congressmen given the award.<ref>{{cite web|last=Drury |first=Shawn |url=http://mauldin.patch.com/articles/rep-trey-gowdy-awarded-by-club-for-growth |title=Rep. Trey Gowdy Awarded by Club for Growth |publisher=Mauldin Patch |date=March 1, 2012 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref>

An ardent social conservative, Gowdy considers himself "pro-life plus." He not only believes "in the sanctity of life," but argues that "the strategy should be broader than waiting for the Supreme Court to revisit ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''."<ref name="Gowdy Issues">{{cite web|title=Issues|url=http://www.treygowdy.com/issues/|publisher=Gowdy For Congress|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>

Trey Gowdy signed the Contract From America, which aims to defund, repeal, and replace the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], limit [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations, enact a reform of the federal tax code, pass a [[balanced budget amendment]], and end [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]].<ref name=Contract>{{cite web|title=Contract From America|url=http://www.thecontract.org/support/|publisher=Contract From America|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Gowdy positions">{{cite web|title=Project Vote Smart|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/121782/trey-gowdy/|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>
