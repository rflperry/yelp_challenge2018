Gibbs was first elected to the Ohio General Assembly in 2002, defeating Democrat Tom Mason of Ashland for a newly drawn district in the Ohio House.

Gibbs began his third term in the Ohio House of Representatives on January 2, 2007 and decided to run for Ohio Senate in 2009 to fill the seat vacated by Senator Ron Amstutz due to term limits.

===Tenure===

He was the lead sponsor of House Bill 223 which introduced rebutable presumption laws to the [[Ohio Bureau of Workers' Compensation]]. In August 2005, Gibbs introduced House Bill 331 (companion bill to enacted Senate Bill 167), which prevents Eminent Domain takings for private entities following the [[Kelo v. New London]] decision in the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] in June 2005.

In 2006 Gibbs was appointed to serve as a member of the Special Task Force to Study Eminent Domain and Its Use and Application in Ohio. The committee spent most of the year studying the issue and issued its final report in August 2006 with recommendations to the General Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.farmanddairy.com/news/legislature-weighs-eminent-domain/831.html|title=Legislature weighs eminent domain |publisher=Farm and Dairy|date=2007-06-14|accessdate=2011-03-09}}</ref>

On August 16, 2007 Gibbs formally announced that he would be a candidate for the 22nd District Senate seat being vacated by the term limited incumbent, Senator [[Ron Amstutz]], (R- Wooster). Gibbs originally expected to face a primary challenge from Representative [[Jim Carmichael]] (R-Wayne County), but Carmichael dropped out of the race on October 21, 2007 in order to run for Wayne County Commissioner. Gibbs faced Democrat James E. Riley, a Job/Security Representative for the U.A.W. International Union.  Gibbs won with 59.04% of the vote.

However, due to winning election to Congress in 2010, Gibbs resigned the Senate only serving half of one term.<ref>http://www.gongwer-oh.com/programming/news_articledisplay.cfm?article_ID=792340204&newsedition_id=7923402&locid=2</ref>
