'''Gregory Paul Walden''' (born January 10, 1957) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OR|2}}, serving since 1999. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. He is the only Republican representative in the state of Oregon.

The district covers more than two-thirds of the state (generally, east of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]). He is the son of Paul E. Walden, three-term Oregon state representative.<ref name="arcweb_leg1971">{{cite web | title = Oregon Legislative Assembly (56th) 1971 Regular Session | work = Oregon State Archives (official website)| publisher = [[Oregon Secretary of State]] | year = 2006 | url = http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1971reg.html | accessdate = 2006-12-08}}</ref>

==Early life, education and career==
Walden earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1981.<ref name=CQRollGuide>{{cite news | title = Guide to the New Congress | date = 2010-11-04 | url = http://innovation.cq.com/newmember/2010elexnguide.pdf | work = [[Roll Call|CQ Roll Call]] | accessdate = 2010-11-24}}</ref>  Before being elected to Congress, Walden owned and ran radio stations.

== Political career ==
Walden served as Press Secretary and Chief of Staff to Congressman [[Denny Smith]] from 1981 to 1987. He was elected to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the [[Oregon State Senate]] to fill a vacancy. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. However, upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for Governor and to not seek re-election to the state Senate.  Their son died soon after birth.<ref>{{cite news

In 1996, Walden announced he was running for the 2nd District as an independent. The district's freshman Republican incumbent, [[Wes Cooley]], whose 1994 campaign Walden had managed, had been caught in several lies about his military service. Cooley's reelection chances were already in serious jeopardy, but it was generally believed that an independent bid by Walden would allow the [[Democratic Party of Oregon|Democrats]] to sneak up the middle and win a seat they hadn't held since 1981.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Ultimately, the Republicans persuaded Cooley's predecessor, [[Robert F. Smith]], to come out of retirement.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}

Smith didn't run for reelection in 1998, and endorsed Walden as his successor.{{citation needed|date=August 2011}} Walden easily won the Republican primary and breezed to election in November and has been reelected five times.  Though his district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]], most of the district leans heavily Republican, and Walden has always been reelected easily. In 2002, he defeated [[Democratic Party of Oregon|Democrat]] [[Peter J. Buckley|Peter Buckley]], who later became a member of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]]. In [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2006|2006]], Walden defeated Democratic candidate [[Carol Voisin]], and in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008|2008]] he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and [[Pacific Green Party|Pacific Green]] Tristin Mock. Following the defeat of Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] in the 2008 elections, Walden became the only Republican to represent Oregon in the United States Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Party leadership===
Walden has been chosen by Speaker [[John Boehner]] to be chairman of the House Majority Transition Committee. He served as chairman of the House Republican Leadership through most of 2010.<ref>[http://www.whorunsgov.com/politerati/revolving-door/meet-the-gop-transition-leader-greg-walden/ Meet the GOP transition leader: Greg Walden], WhoRunsGov.com, November 8, 2010</ref>

Following the 2012 Elections, Walden became chair of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. In July 2014, he announced he would seek a second term as chairman of the committee, arguing he would help provide continuity in a changing leadership team after the defeat of [[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]]. <ref>{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Abby|title=Greg Walden to Seek Second Term Running NRCC (Updated)|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/elections-2014-nrcc-greg-walden-second-term/?dcz=emailalert|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=30 July 2014}}</ref>

** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]] (Chairman)
** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]

From 2010 to 2011, Walden gave up his seat on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]], at Republican leadership request so that [[Parker Griffith]], who had recently switched parties, could take his spot on that committee.<ref name="nrccroll">{{cite web | title = Walden Rises Up From Obscurity | work = [[Roll Call]] | publisher = [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] | date = March 8, 2010| url = http://www.nrcc.org/news/Read.aspx?ID=1565 | accessdate = 2010-04-09}}</ref>

Walden founded the [[Small Brewers Caucus]] (see [[Alcohol in Oregon]]) and the [[Digital Television Caucus]]; as of 2007, he was a member of 39 [[congressional caucus]]es:<ref>{{cite news|title=Another day, another caucus
