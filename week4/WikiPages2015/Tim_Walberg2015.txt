'''Timothy Lee''' "'''Tim'''" '''Walberg''' (born April 12, 1951) is the current [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Michigan|7}}, and was also the former Congressman for the district from 2007 to 2009.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Walberg was born and educated in [[Chicago]], Illinois, the son of Alice Ann and John A. Walberg. His paternal grandparents were Swedish.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walberg.htm|title=tim walberg|publisher=|accessdate=13 October 2014}}</ref> He left a post-high school position with the [[U.S. Forest Service]] to pursue higher education. At one point working in a steel mill to help pay tuition, he studied forestry at [[Western Illinois University]] and attended [[Moody Bible Institute]], and completed his degree in 1975, when he earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in religious education from [[Taylor University]]. By then Walberg was half-way through a four-year stint as a pastor at Grace Fellowship Church in [[New Haven, Indiana]], which concluded when he enrolled in the [[Wheaton College (Illinois)|Wheaton College]] graduate school. After receiving an [[Master of Arts (postgraduate)|M.A.]] in communications in 1978, Walberg and his young family relocated to [[Franklin Township, Lenawee County, Michigan|Tipton, Michigan]], where he led services at Union Gospel Church. He resigned his pastorship in 1982 in preparation for a successful bid for the [[Michigan House of Representatives]].

==Michigan legislature==
Walberg served in the [[Michigan House of Representatives]] from 1983 to 1998. He was succeeded by [[Doug Spade]] and the seat is currently held by [[Dudley Spade]], both Democrats. Walberg also spent time as a pastor and as a division manager for the [[Moody Bible Institute]] in [[Chicago, Illinois]] while continuing to live in Michigan.<ref>[http://www.hillsdale.net/stories/042206//news_2006042200121.shtml Hillsdale.net<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

===Elections===
;2004
After six years out of politics, Walberg ran in a field of six candidates in the 2004 Republican primary for the 7th District after six-term incumbent [[Nick Smith (U.S. politician)|Nick Smith]] retired.  He lost to former [[Michigan Senate|State Senator]] [[Joe Schwarz]], a moderate Republican. Schwarz went on to win in November.

;2006
Walberg immediately began gearing up for a rematch against Schwarz in 2006.  Walberg defeated Schwarz in the primary by 3,915 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06PRI/06007000.html |title=2006 Official Michigan Primary Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position |publisher=Miboecfr.nictusa.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

In October 2006, the Walberg campaign's volunteer coordinator pled guilty to child abuse charges.<ref>[http://www.wlns.com/Global/story.asp?S=5806705&nav=0RbQ WLNS TV 6 Lansing Jackson Michigan News and Weather - WLNS.COM | Our Apologies<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The allegations first appeared in the ''Jackson Citizen Patriot''.<ref name="JCP1">{{cite news

The staffer pled guilty to the charges on September 18 and left the campaign after the charges became public in October. Walberg frequently stated the matter was "private" and he hoped the best for the family involved.

Walberg's defeat of Schwarz gave the Democrats hope of winning the seat.  Although Republicans had held it for decades, the 7th is a somewhat marginal district on paper; it narrowly voted for [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996 and voted for [[George W. Bush]] almost as narrowly in 2000 and 2004.  On the other hand, Schwarz had won the previous election (against the same Democratic opponent) by 22%.

On November 7, 2006, Walberg defeated Democrat Sharon Renier 50%-46%.<ref>[http://miboecfr.nictusa.com/election/results/06GEN/06007000.html 2006 Official Michigan General Election Results - 7th District Representative in Congress 2 Year Term (1) Position<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The Renier campaign spent $46,000<ref>[http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/dcdev/forms/C00425462/272290/ FEC Disclosure Form 3 for Sharon Renier for Congress<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> to Walberg's $1.2 million<ref>[http://herndon1.sdrdc.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_06+H4MI07103 FEC Candidate Summary Reports - Candidate ID H4MI07103<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Entering the 2008 race, Walberg was identified by Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee chairman [[Chris Van Hollen]] as one of the most vulnerable Republican incumbents in congress.<ref>[http://hotlineblog.nationaljournal.com/archives/2007/01/van_hollens_top.html Hotline On Call: Van Hollen's Top '08 Targets<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  On August 23, 2007, State Senate Minority Leader [[Mark Schauer]] announced he would challenge Walberg in the 2008 election.<ref>{{cite news |title=Senate minority leader to challenge Walberg |url=http://www.lansingstatejournal.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070823/NEWS01/708230386 |publisher=Lansing State Journal|date=2007-08-23|accessdate=2007-08-24 |archiveurl= |archivedate= }} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> The prior occupant of the seat, [[Joe Schwarz]], who was defeated by Walberg in the 2006 Republican primary declined to run himself, but on September 30 endorsed Schauer.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/chi-ap-mi-schauer-congress,0,7495459.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=Topic Galleries}}</ref>

Schauer narrowly defeated Walberg in the November 2008 election. Republican presidential candidate [[John McCain]] lost the district to Democrat [[Barack Obama]] by nearly 17,000 votes but outperformed Walberg by over 6,000 votes, while Walberg lost to Schauer by 7,432 votes. Between the two candidates, around $3.5 million were spent on the campaign,<ref>{{cite news |title=Schauer declares victory in 7th District U.S. House race|url=http://www.michigandaily.com/content/2008-11-05/schauer-wins-7th-district |publisher=Michigan Daily|date=2008-11-05|accessdate=2008-11-13}}</ref> along with the massive amount spent by independent groups, made it the most expensive House race in the 2008 election.<ref>http://www.politickerco.com/jeremypelzer/2692/co-4-independent-spending-third-highest-nation</ref>

;Iraq War security comments
In March 2007, Walberg was a guest on the Jack Ebling show on [[WILS]]-AM. During the broadcast Walberg stated that most of Iraq was as stable as [[Detroit, Michigan]] or [[Harvey, Illinois]]. Both the offices of the [[Mayor of Detroit]] and the Mayor of Harvey released statements requesting an apology from Walberg. ''"Unfortunately, for years people have beat up on the city of Detroit. Detroit is the word for negative. We are working very hard to transform that image of our city"'', said James Canning, spokesman for the Detroit office of the Mayor. Mayor Kellogg of Harvey stated: ''"Even though our country appears to have accomplish(ed) great gains in racial harmony, we still have members of congress who suffer from the highest levels of ignorance and stupidity."''<ref>[http://www.lsj.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070322/NEWS01/70322004 ''Lansing State Journal'']

;Recall efforts
On August 6, 2007, the [[Lenawee County, Michigan|Lenawee County]] Elections Commission approved the wording for [[Jackson, Michigan|Jackson]] resident James Carr's recall petition.<ref>[http://blog.mlive.com/annarbornews/2007/08/recall_campaign_launched_again.html Recall campaign launched against Walberg]. Retrieved August 8, 2007.</ref> While Michigan laws and constitution allow for [[recall election]]s, an attorney for Walberg says there is no provision in the U.S. Constitution for recalling a United States Congressperson and challenged the action in court. On August 28, 2007, Lenawee County Circuit Court Judge Harvey Koselka issued an injunction that prohibited filing signed petitions with the state until a ruling is made on the constitutionality of recalling a member of Congress.<ref>
