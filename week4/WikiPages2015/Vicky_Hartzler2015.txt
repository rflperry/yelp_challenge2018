==Missouri legislature==
Before running for State Representative in 1994, Hartzler taught high school home economics for 11 years.<ref>[http://www.onenewsnow.com/Journal/stories.aspx?id=73875 Purging the pain from political campaigns] Murphree, Randall.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2010 election===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2010#District 4}}

After almost a decade out of politics, Hartzler entered the Republican primary for {{ushr|MO|4}}, held by 17-term Democratic incumbent [[Ike Skelton]]. She won a crowded seven-way primary with 40 percent of the vote.

In the November 2 election, Hartzler won with 50.4% of the vote. She is the first Republican to represent this district since 1955, and only the second since the [[Great Depression]].  She was also the second Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri, after [[Jo Ann Emerson]], with whom she served from 2011 to 2013.  However, she is the first who was not elected as a stand-in for her husband; Emerson was originally elected to serve out the final term of her late husband, [[Bill Emerson]].  However, Republicans had been making gains in the district for some time; it gave [[John McCain]] 62 percent of the vote in 2008, and Republicans hold most of the district's seats in the state legislature.

She ran on a conservative platform, voicing support for tax cuts and spending cuts.  She is [[pro-life]] and opposes gay marriage.

At a town hall meeting in Missouri on April 5, 2012, Hartzler expressed doubts regarding President [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|birth certificate]].<ref>{{Cite news  | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/06/vicki-hartzler-birther_n_1409082.html | title=Obama Birth Certificate: Missouri Congresswoman Vicki Hartzler Expresses Doubt  | publisher=[[Huffington Post]] | accessdate=April 6, 2012 | first=John | last=Celock | date=April 6, 2012}}</ref>

In September 2013, Hartzler voted in favor of a $39 billion reduction in SNAP Benefits (aka "food stamps").

On November 18, 2014, during the worst early season cold snap in the U.S. since 1976, Hartzler expressed apparent confusion over the difference between weather and climate and the issue of [[climate change]] on [[Twitter]].
