==Early life, education and career==
Crowley was born in [[New York City]], the son of an Irish-American father and an immigrant Catholic mother from [[County Armagh]], [[Northern Ireland]]. A paternal uncle was also a politician. Joseph Crowley attended private New York City Roman Catholic schools, including [[Power Memorial Academy]], and graduated from [[Queens College]] with a degree in political science.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/22142/ Joseph Crowley (D).] ''[[The Washington Post]].''</ref> He worked briefly as a legislative aide.

==New York Assembly==
In 1986, aged 24, he was elected to the [[New York Assembly]]. Because of his Irish roots, he quickly became involved in Irish politics throughout New York. Crowley would serve in the Assembly until 1998.<ref name="Crowley Votes">{{cite news|title=Crowley Votes|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/C001038|work=The U.S. Congress Votes Database|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=1 May 2012}}</ref><ref name="Crowley Profile">{{cite news|title=Joseph Crowley (D-N.Y.)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joseph-crowley-d-ny/gIQACIr09O_topic.html|work=Who Runs Gov|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=1 May 2012|date=21 December 2011|first=Paul|last=Kane}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Democratic Congressman [[Thomas J. Manton]] quietly retired from the Congress in 1998, having already filed for and circulated petitions for re-election. He withdrew on the last day it was legally possible to do so and arranged for Crowley, his chosen successor, to replace him on the ballot. Crowley wasn't aware of this until Manton phoned him to tell him his name would be on the general election ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/many-foes-may-struggle-to-replace-rangel/37323/| title=Many Foes May Struggle To Replace Rangel |publisher=The New York Sun |date=August 4, 2006 |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

He also created the Urban Area Security Initiative, which directs money to prevent terrorism toward regions that are seen as the most threatened.

Crowley, who has spent much time in India, created a Bangladesh caucus and was formerly the chair of the India Caucus.<ref name="Crowley Post Bio">{{cite news|title=Joseph Crowley (D - NY)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/joseph-crowley-d-ny/gIQACIr09O_topic.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=31 May 2012|date=21 December 2011|first=Paul|last=Kane}}</ref>

==Policy Positions==

He was, at one time, in between both sides of this debate. In 1999, he received a rating of 52% from NARAL (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League) Pro-choice America and 53% from the National Right to Life Committee.<ref name="votesmart.org">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/4295/joe-crowley#.UKmNkG_7Jkl/ |title=Joe Crowley's Ratings and Endorsements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> He voted in favor of the 1999 Abortion Funding Amendment that withheld federal funding to foreign institutions which provided family planning services and promoted abortion.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/3605/8862/4295/abortion-funding-amendment#.UKmQBG_7Jkk |title=H Amdt 360 - Abortion Funding Amendment - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=1999-07-29 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In addition, in 2003, he voted to ban partial-birth abortions (excepting cases which endanger the life of the mother).<ref name="ontheissues.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/NY/Joseph_Crowley_Abortion.htm |title=Joseph Crowley on Abortion |publisher=Ontheissues.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> However, recently, he has shifted his positions strongly in the pro-choice direction. Since 2005, he has consistently received ratings of 100% from NARAL, and 0% from the National Right to Life Committee.<ref name="votesmart.org"/> In 2011, he opposed a bill which would have banned taxpayer funding for abortions,<ref name="ontheissues.org"/> and, in the 2010 election, he was endorsed by Planned Parenthood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/4295/joe-crowley/#.UKmUQm_7Jkk |title=Joe Crowley's Issue Positions (Political Courage Test) - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

===Healthcare===
Joseph Crowley has been a consistent supporter of The 2010 Affordable Care Act (widely known as “Obamacare”). On March 22, 2010, he stated, “I... support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a historic measure that will put families first when it comes to accessing health care coverage.” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/495035/#.UKmV6m_7Jkk |title=Reconciliation Act Of 2010 - Public Statements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> He opposed repealing the act and voted against a repeal on January 19, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/12465/33026/4295/33026/4295/#.UKmXcW_7Jkk |title=HR 2 - Repealing the Health Care Bill - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In addition, in 2011, he held an event to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the bill’s passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/598157/#.UKmY5G_7Jkk |title=Congressman Crowley Marks One-Year Anniversary of Health Care Law with Event at Queens Senior Center - Public Statements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=2011-03-23 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

Since 2007, he has received a rating of 100% from the American Public Health Association, American Nurses Association, and the National Breast Cancer coalition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/4295/joe-crowley/38#.UKmYHm_7Jkk |title=Joe Crowley's Ratings and Endorsements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

===Economy/Budget===
Representative Crowley holds the view “that reducing barriers to investment, creating opportunities for small businesses, and providing equitable working conditions for all Americans can and should be part of our national economic policy” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowley.house.gov/issue/economy |title=Economy and Jobs &#124; Congressman Joseph Crowley |publisher=Crowley.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> He has supported federal spending as a way to increase economic growth. In 2008, he endorsed the Financial Asset Purchase Authority and Tax Law Amendments which established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to buy assets from troubled financial institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/6356/22467/4295/22467/4295/#.UKnAD2_7Jkk |title=HR 1424 - Financial Asset Purchase Authority and Tax Law Amendments - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

When dealing with the budget, Representative Crowley has advocated tax increases on the highest tax brackets, tax cuts for the middle class, and reduced defense spending. When serving on the Ways and Means Committee he stated, “ 'I really don't see how it's justifiable or sensible to give a tax cut to the wealthiest among us, but at the same time increase taxes on U.S. soldiers.”<ref>[http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2083&Itemid=165 ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> He also applauded the 2009 Budget for ending the Alternative Minimum Tax, and ensuring tax cuts for 23 million middle class Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/358653/#.UKnCZm_7Jkk |title=Crowley Applauds House Passage 2009 Federal Budget - Public Statements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=2008-03-13 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> In addition, in 2011, he opposed a bill which appropriated funds to the defense budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/13056/34387/4295/34387/4295/#.UKnEBm_7Jkk |title=HR 1363 - 2011 Department of Defense Budget and Additional Continuing Appropriations - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Crowley was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. The seat was considered open after incumbent Rep. Thomas Manton retired, but not without controversy.  Manton announced his retirement from Congress shortly after the deadline passed for individuals wishing to file for the Democratic primary. (Manton was the only individual who filed for the primary.) As head of the Queens Democratic Party apparatus, Manton was able to handpick his successor - Crowley, a former Manton staffer.  Since being elected to Congress, he has yet to face a serious challenge for his seat.
