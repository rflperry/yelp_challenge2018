==Political positions==
Following the economic crisis of Wall Street in September 2008, Graves voted against the [[proposed bailout of United States financial system]], claiming that it neither "punished the wrongdoers nor adequately protected the innocent taxpayers, investors and retirees” caught in the Wall Street banking crisis."<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.stjoenews.net/news/2008/sep/30/graves-boyda-vote-against-700b-bailout-us-house/ | title=Graves, Boyda vote against $700B bailout in the U.S. House  | publisher=[[The News-Press]] |date= September 30, 2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}}</ref>
In January 2014, Graves introduced the TRICARE Family Improvement Act. The bill would allow dependents of military members to stay on their parents' TRICARE health plan after turning age 26. The bill would change current law, which requires those dependents to change to a separate health plan after turning 26.<ref>[http://riponadvance.com/news/graves-proposes-changes-military-family-health-coverage/6420 "Graves proposes changes to military family health coverage"].

==Todd Graves controversy==
Graves is the brother of [[Todd Graves]], former U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Missouri.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080930/BLOGS09/80930039 | title=Kit Bond apologizes for staff's role in firing of federal prosecutor   | publisher=[[The News Leader]] |date= September 30, 2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> In October 2008, [[U.S. Senator]] [[Kit Bond]] apologized to Todd Graves after a [[U.S. Justice Department]] report cited Bond forcing Graves out over a disagreement with Representative Graves.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.news-leader.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080930/BLOGS09/80930039 | title=Kit Bond apologizes for staff's role in firing of federal prosecutor   | publisher=[[The News Leader]] |date= September 30, 2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref> Following the report, U.S. Attorney General [[Michael Mukasey]] appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether former U.S. Attorney General [[Alberto Gonzales]] and other officials involved in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys broke the law ([[dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy]]).<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics/AP/story/706763.html | title=Prosecutor will investigate firings of nine U.S. Attorneys  | publisher=[[The Miami Herald]] |date= September 29, 2008  | first= | last=  | accessdate =2007-05-17}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Ethics investigation==
In 2009, the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]] began inquiring whether or not Graves used his position on the [[United States House Committee on Small Business|Small Business Committee]] to invite Brooks Hurst, a longtime friend and a business partner of his wife, to testify at a committee hearing on the federal regulation of [[biodiesel]] and [[ethanol]] production.  Graves had failed to mention the financial link between Hurst and Lesley Graves at the hearing, which dealt with federal subsidies for renewable fuels.  A review by the independent [[Office of Congressional Ethics]] found "substantial reason to believe that an appearance of conflict of interest was created."<ref>[http://www.kansascity.com/115/story/1538682.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> Graves said in a statement, "I look forward to a quick review of the facts and answering any questions that the committee may have. I believe that a speedy review will show that all the rules of the House concerning testimony in front of the Small Business Committee were followed."<ref>

==Political campaigns==
[[File:George Bush visit Kansas City Assembly.jpg|thumb|right|Graves on the left with President [[George W. Bush]] at the [[Ford]] [[Kansas City Assembly]] Plant in [[Claycomo, Missouri]] on March 20, 2007]]
In 2000, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[U.S. Representative]] [[Pat Danner]] suddenly retired due to [[breast cancer]]. Graves filed within the short period of time left for filing. Graves faced Representative Danner's son, Steve Danner, a former State Senator, in the general election. Graves referred to Danner as a "tax and spend liberal" and won the race with 51% of the vote <ref>http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=14&oid=3990&arc=1</ref> largely by running up huge margins in the rural areas of the district. He was arguably helped by [[George W. Bush]] carrying the district in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 presidential election]]. Graves easily won reelection in 2002,<ref>http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=87&oid=24483&arc=1</ref> 2004,<ref>http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=131&oid=32756&arc=1</ref> and 2006.<ref>http://www.sos.mo.gov/enrweb/raceresults.asp?eid=189&oid=43072&arc=</ref>

===2008===
{{See also| United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2008#District 6}}
Graves faced a tougher reelection race in 2008 against Democratic nominee and former [[List of mayors of Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City Mayor]] [[Kay Barnes]]. He gained national attention early in the race for running an ad accusing Barnes of promoting "[[San Francisco values]]." It was initially considered one of the hottest races in the country. However, Graves won reelection fairly handily, taking 59 percent of the vote to Barnes's 37 percent. Because the district has historically not been considered safe for either party, elections in the district tend to be closely contested.

===2010===
{{See also| United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2010#District 6}}
Graves defeated Democratic nominee Clint Hylton (an [[Excelsior Springs, Missouri]] insurance agent who owned a farm in [[Polo, Missouri]]) and write-in candidate Kyle Yarber.
