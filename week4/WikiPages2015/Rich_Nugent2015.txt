===Tenure===
Richard B. Nugent was sworn into Congress on January 3, 2011 to represent the 5th Congressional District of Florida.  He succeeded Congresswoman Ginny Brown-Waite, who chose not to run because of health concerns.

Congressman Nugent, in just two months as a member of Congress has co-sponsored 29 pieces of legislation, including H.R. 2 - Repeal of the Health Care Law Act, H.R.25 - The Fair Tax Act of 2011, H.R. 49 - American Energy Independence and Price Reduction Act, H.R. 121 - Congressional Budget Accountability Act, H.R. 127 - to deauthorize appropriation of funds to carry out the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and the Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010, H.R. 144 - Small Business Paperwork Mandate Elimination Act of 2011,  H.R. 154 - Defund the Individual Mandate Act, Hr. 177 - Death Tax Repeal Act, H.R. 178 - Military Surviving Spouses Equity Act, H.R. 333 - Disabled Veterans Tax Termination Act and H.R. 42` - To eliminate automatic pay adjustments for Members of Congress.

;Spending cuts
Congressman Nugent claims to be committed to fighting against what he terms out of control spending presently happening in Washington.  He opposed the $700 billion bailout by President Bush, a temporaty fix for de-regulation of the banking and finance industries, two unfunded Bush era wars, and a decades-long wage decrease.  He also opposed the Obama Administration's $862 billion stimulus package, which was an attempt by President Obama to bolster a damaged economy.

Nugent has pledged to fight to reduce spending in Washington. He also believes that parts of government spending (including the Health Care Law) are unconstitutional.  He claims that his main reason for opposing continued deficit spending is simply that American families just cannot afford it anymore.  Nugent claims to believe that each American family's share of the national debt already stands at $118,000 and asks the question "what happens to these families when the federal government's bill comes due? He has signed on as a co-sponsor to both balanced budget amendments offered by Rep. Bob Goodlatte (R-VA).<ref>[http://nugent.house.gov/issue/spending-cuts-and-debt ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>

;Tax Reform
Nugent signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 25, better known as "[[FairTax|The Fair Tax]]".  This legislation introduced by Rep. Rob Woodall (R-GA) would abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), repeal the federal income tax, and replace it with a transparent tax on consumption.<ref>[http://nugent.house.gov/issue/taxes ]{{dead link|date=May 2012}}</ref>

In 2010 Nugent signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Nugent_Richard.pdf</ref>

;Health Care Act
Congressman Nugent opposed the passage of President Obama's health care legislation and has vowed to work for its repeal. He has stated that he is open to listening to anybody's plan to save and reform Medicare so long as benefits are completely unchanged for those 55 and up.  He has stated he will ensure that Americans can keep the coverage they already have.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nugentforcongress.com/index.cfm/issues |title=Issues - Rich Nugent for Congress |publisher=Nugentforcongress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref> Nugent is so opposed to the Health Care Law, that he has been an outspoken supporter of a Congressional lawsuit against President Obama for delaying the implementation of a part of the law.{{Clarify|date=August 2014}}
