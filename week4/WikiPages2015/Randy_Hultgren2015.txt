;2012
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Illinois, 2012 #District 14}}
As a result of the [[United States congressional apportionment|decennial reapportionment]] following the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]], Illinois lost one seat in the [[US House of Representatives]].  The new district map (now featuring only 18 districts, and drawn by the Democratic-controlled [[Illinois General Assembly]]), included areas previously represented in the [[Illinois's 8th congressional district|8th district]] in the new 14th district.  The 8th district was  represented by [[Joe Walsh (Illinois politician)|Joe Walsh]], but as Walsh  lives in the new 14th district, he considered challenging Hultgren in the primary.  Hultgren announced his intention to run for re-election, while Walsh decided to run in the 8th district.<ref>[http://www.hultgrenforcongress.com/2011/09/02/hultgren-will-seek-re-election-in-14th Hultgren will seek re-election in the 14th] Hultgren for Congress</ref>

In the general election, Hultgren won re-election to a second term, beating Democratic candidate Dennis Anderson, with 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/IL</ref>

Hultgren ran for a third term and was opposed by Dennis Anderson for a second time. Hultgren again defeated Anderson, this time with 65% of the vote.

===Tenure===
Hultgren introduced the [[Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act (H.R. 992; 113th Congress)]] into the House on March 6, 2013. The bill would improve the ability of banks to use [[Swap (finance)|swaps]] as a tool for [[Hedge (finance)|hedging]] risk by amending the [[Doddâ€“Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].<ref name=wedsPete>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Wednesday: Sebelius, budget, farm bill, Dodd-Frank, debt ceiling... and baseball|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/188622-wednesday-sebelius-budget-farm-bill-dodd-frank-debt-ceiling%E2%80%A6|accessdate=1 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=30 October 2013}}</ref><ref name=992sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 992 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/992|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=1 November 2013}}</ref>

Hultgren supported the [[Hire More Heroes Act of 2013 (H.R. 3474; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would allow employers to exclude [[veterans]] receiving health insurance from the [[United States Department of Defense]] or the [[United States Department of Veterans' Affairs]] from their list of employees.<ref name=3474sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3474 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3474|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref><ref name="HultgrenPR"/> This would have the effect of keeping their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act#Employer mandate and part-time working hours|require them to provide their employees with healthcare]] under the requirements of the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref name="HultgrenPR"/><ref name=PeteGOPeyes1>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=GOP eyes Dem help on ObamaCare|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/200316-gop-hoping-dems-help-expand-obamacare-exemptions|accessdate=11 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=10 March 2014}}</ref> Hultgren wrote in favor of the bill saying that the employer health insurance mandate "is just another costly burden that discourages employers from expanding their workforce, and our economy cannot afford it. Lifting this burden on small businesses is a win for our veterans and our economy."<ref name=HultgrenPR>{{cite web|last=Hultgren|first=Randy|title=Let's Give Jobs to Veterans: Hultgren Supports Hire More Heroes Act|url=http://oswego.patch.com/groups/rep-randy-hultgrens-blog/p/lets-give-jobs-to-veterans-hultgren-supports-hire-more-heroes-act|publisher=Osqego Patch|accessdate=11 March 2014|date=13 January 2014}}</ref>

Hultgren went on record to note that "''The U.S. research system is unique. Weâ€™ve found an incredibly powerful combination, wedding education and research by incorporating universities, user facilities and Department of Energy resources. But this system is only as stable our commitment to it, which is why sustained and predictable research funding is crucial.''" <ref>http://www.aps.org/publications/capitolhillquarterly/201105/backpage.cfm</ref>

Along with Democratic Senator [[Mark Udall]], Hultgren was awarded the George Brown Science Technology Engineering Leadership award by the Science, Technology, Engineering Working Group,<ref name="aps.org"/> a coalition of pro-science groups including [[The American Association for the Advancement of Science]], the [[American Institute of Physics]], [[ASME]], et al.<ref>http://setcvd.org/member-organizations</ref>
