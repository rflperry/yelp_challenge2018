Michaud was previously [[President of the Maine Senate]]. He was employed for over two decades at the [[Great Northern Paper Company]] and remains a member of the [[United Steelworkers]]. He is one of the few current members of Congress never to have attended college.<ref name=wsj>{{cite news|title=Election 2012 - Mike Michaud (D) |url=http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-michaud--ME-H |work=[[Wall Street Journal]] |publisher= |year=2012 |accessdate=2014-10-31}}</ref> He did, however, attend the [[John F.

Michaud was the Democratic nominee for [[Governor of Maine]] in the [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2014|2014 election]]. <ref name=officialentry>{{cite news|url=http://www.pressherald.com/politics/maine-election-2014-governor-steve-woods.html|title=Senate campaign over, Steve Woods is running for governor|date=November 16, 2012|accessdate=November 17, 2012|agency=Associated Press|publisher=[[Portland Press Herald]]}}</ref> While initially considered a favorite by some analysts on account of the general unpopularity of incumbent [[Paul LePage]], he lost to the aforementioned by a larger than expected margin, in large part due to the massive Republican wave election that took place nationwide. Michaud's political future is unclear at this point, since in running for Governor, he also gave up his seat in Congress, which is due to be taken over by Republican [[Bruce Poliquin]] in January 2015.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Michaud was born in Millinocket, Maine, the son of Geneva Jean (née Morrow) and James Michaud, Sr. His parents were both of French-Canadian descent.<ref>{{cite web|author=Juliana L&#x2019;Heureux |url=http://www.mainewriter.com/articles/Political-Genealogy.htm |title=Political Genealogy |publisher=Mainewriter.com |date=1927-01-07 |accessdate=2013-12-05}}</ref> He grew up in [[Medway, Maine]], and is a graduate of [[Schenck High School]] in [[East Millinocket, Maine|East Millinocket]]. He was a mill worker and supervisor at [[Great Northern Paper Company]] in [[East Millinocket, Maine|East Millinocket]], from 1973 until his election to Congress in 2002, during which time he was a member of the [[United Steelworkers]]. Michaud's interest in politics began when he campaigned to clean up the [[Penobscot River]] in the late 1970s.

;2002
Michaud ran for Congress in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2002#Maine|2002]] for [[Maine's 2nd congressional district]] after incumbent Democrat [[John Baldacci]] decided to run for [[Governor of Maine]]. Michaud faced three other state senators in the Democratic primary. He won the primary with a plurality of 31% of the vote, beating the second place challenger, Susan W. Longley, by 4 percentage points. The general election garnered considerable publicity because Michaud was [[pro-life]], while the Republican was [[pro-choice]]. Republican [[Kevin Raye]], of [[Perry, Maine|Perry]], was the Chief of Staff to U.S. Senator [[Olympia Snowe]]. Michaud defeated Raye, 52%–48%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=866 |title=ME District 2 Race - Nov 05, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-11-02}}</ref>
