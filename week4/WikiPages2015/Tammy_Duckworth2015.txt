We really need to think about drawing down," she told ''The Sunday Times''. "I want the [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] to come before [[United States Congress|Congress]] and tell us how many Iraqis are fully trained. If two guys can do traffic control in [[Kirkuk]], I want to bring two Americans home."<ref name="times_leads_charge">Sarah Baxter[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,2089-2415686,00.html "War heroine leads Democrat charge"], ''The Sunday Times'', October 22, 2006.</ref></blockquote>

When asked whether she would like to see Bush impeached, Duckworth said that Congress had "far more pressing issues to deal with." {{cn|date=November 2014}}

===Defense spending===
In August 2006, Duckworth called on Congress to audit the estimated $437 billion spent on overseas military and foreign aid since September 11, 2001. She said, "Real and meaningful oversight has taken a back seat to partisan inaction. With the right kind of leadership Congress can bring greater fiscal discipline and accountability to the billions of dollars we are spending on our military efforts."<ref name="Corcoran">{{cite news|publisher=Northbrook Star|date=August 17, 2006|author=Pat Corcoran|title=Duckworth calls for investigation of foreign spending since 9/11|url=http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20060821081045/http://www.pioneerlocal.com/cgi-bin/ppo-story/localnews/current/nb/08-17-06-1005047.html|archivedate=August 21, 2006}}</ref>

===Gun control===
On October 10, 2006, Duckworth was endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]]. The endorsement was announced in a joint appearance with the [[Fraternal Order of Police]], who had also endorsed Duckworth. At the press conference in [[Lombard, Illinois]], Duckworth referred to the recent [[school shootings]] and criticized her opponent's opposition to renewing a [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban|Federal ban on semi-automatic firearms]], which expired in 2004. Duckworth claimed, "Basically, whatever the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] wants, [[Peter Roskam]] will vote for it." She supported the Brady Law, which requires [[background check]]s for gun purchases from federally licensed firearm dealers.<ref name="Trib_Gun_laws">John Biemer and Christi Parsons, [http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/local/west/chi-0610110053oct11,1,6499430.story?coll=chi-newslocalwest-hed "Gun law heats up race for Congress"], ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'', October 11, 2006 (registration required)</ref><ref name="Krol_Gun_Record">Eric Krol, [http://www.dailyherald.com/politics/story.asp?id=237246 "Duckworth takes aim at Roskam gun record"], dailyherald.com, October 11, 2006.</ref>
