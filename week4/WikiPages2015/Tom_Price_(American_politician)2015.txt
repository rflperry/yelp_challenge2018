==U.S. House of Representatives (2005-Present)==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2004, U.S. Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%-46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101</ref>

;2006
In 2006, Price drew one primary challenger, John Konop, who he easily defeated 82%-18%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=311132</ref> In November, he won re-election to a second term with 72% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=206831</ref>

;2008â€“Present
Price won re-election in 2008 (68%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387947</ref> 2010 (100%),<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488686</ref> and 2012 (65%).<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753473</ref>

Tom Price opposes abortion and supported the proposed Protect Life Act, which would have denied [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (PPACA) funding to health care plans that offered abortion (the PPACA already prevented public funding covering abortions) and allowed hospitals to decline to provide emergency abortion care.<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/10/13/protect-life-act-passes-house-of-representatives_n_1009876.html Protect Life Act, Controversial Anti-Abortion Bill, Passes House]</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/643441/price-statement-on-the-protect-life-act/?search=abortion</ref> He was rated at 100 by the National Right to Life Center.

However, due to this belief, the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]] gave him a 0% approval rate.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/11853/tom-price/4</ref>  He supported the Farm Dust Regulation Prevention Act, stating that it would keep the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] from applying too many regulations to farming and ranching.<ref>http://votesmart.org/public-statement/656161/price-statement-on-house-passage-of-farm-dust-regulation-prevention-act/?search=farmers</ref> He also voted for the Agricultural Disaster Assistance Act of 2012 which, had it become law, would have made supplemental agricultural disaster assistance available, if needed.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hr6233</ref><ref>http://votesmart.org/bill/votes/41290</ref>

In 2008 Price signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2008/08/price.pdf</ref>

===Legislation===
Price is the sponsor of the [[Empowering Patients First Act]] (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.

Price introduced the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)]] on May 8, 2013.<ref name=1874sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1874|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=1874cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 - CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45213|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 March 2014}}</ref> Price said it was necessary because the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost.

In total, Price has sponsored 55 bills, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Price's Legislation|url=http://www.congress.gov/member/tom-price/1778?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22Price%22%5D%2C%22sponsorship%22%3A%22sponsored%22%2C%22type%22%3A%22bills%22%7D|publisher=Library of Congress|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref>
