'''John Rice Carter''' (born November 6, 1941) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|TX|31}}, serving since 2003. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Carter was elected [[Republican Conference Secretary of the United States House of Representatives|Secretary of the House Republican Conference]] by his colleagues on November 17, 2006.

==Early life, education and career==
Carter was born in [[Houston]], but has spent most of his life in central Texas. Carter graduated from [[Texas Tech University]] with a degree in history in 1964, and earned a law degree from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in 1969. 

After graduating from law school, Carter served as the first general counsel to the [[Texas House of Representatives]]’ Agriculture Committee. Carter later began a successful private law practice in Round Rock.

In 1981, Carter was appointed as judge of the 277th District Court of [[Williamson County, Texas|Williamson County]]. He was elected to the post a year later — the first Republican elected to a countywide position in Williamson County. He was reelected four times, usually with 60% of the vote.

A staunch fiscal and social conservative, Carter prides himself on having raised a family built on what he calls "Texas Values."

Carter is best known as the author of a law that made it easier to prove [[identity theft]] and provides stiff penalties for the offense. It was signed into law by [[George W. Bush]] in 2004.

===110th Congress===
In the 110th Congress, Congressman Carter has sponsored and co-sponsored a number of bills including the Military Spouses Residency Relief Act, the Terrorist Death Penalty Act of 2008, and a bill condemning the vandalism of the Vietnam War Memorial on the National Mall.  On the Appropriations Committee, Congressman Carter introduced an amendment to the Homeland Security Appropriations Bill to provide $12 million in funding to the section 287(g) of the Immigration Nationality Act (INA) which allows Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) to delegate enforcement powers to state and local law enforcement allowing them to investigate, detain and arrest criminal aliens. However, this amendment was defeated in committee.  

Also, when Democratic Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the House of Representatives recessed in August 2008 for five weeks, Congressman Carter was one of many Republicans who stayed in Washington.  This was part of a GOP protest, in which they claimed that Congress should not have recessed for five weeks without addressing the energy crisis many Americans were facing. The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that as of 2008 among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives, Carter had the second-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog - Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on Aug. 8, 2008</ref>

===111th Congress===
On June 12, 2009, Carter signed on as a co-sponsor of [[H.R. 1503]], the bill introduced as a reaction to [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|conspiracy theories which claimed that U.S. President Barack Obama is not a natural born U.S. citizen]].<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1503|date=|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01503:@@@P|publisher=The Library of Congress}}</ref>

On September 15, 2009, Carter called the 111th Congress a "house of hypocrisy" after the House of Representatives voted to rebuke [[South Carolina]] Representative [[Joe Wilson (U.S. politician)|Joe Wilson]] for his outburst, but would not go after New York Representative and House Ways and Means Chair [[Charlie Rangel]], who has been the subject of numerous ethical problems involving taxes and property.<ref>{{cite web|title=Speaking of apologies: Hypocrisy clouds Democrats’ demand for "You lie" apology|date=|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/lawmaker-news/58767-speaking-of-apologies-hypocrisy-clouds-democrats-demand-for-you-lie-apology-rep-john-carter|publisher=The Hill}}</ref> Carter is also a proponent of the "Rangel Rule," where [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] penalties and interest would be eliminated if one paid back taxes, similar to the treatment Rangel, [[Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]], and former [[South Dakota]] Senator (and one-time Secretary of Health and Human Services nominee) [[Tom Daschle]] received after their tax problems were made public.<ref>{{cite news|title=GOP Congressman Intros 'Rangel Rule,' Eliminating IRS Late Fees|date=January 28, 2009|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/01/28/gop-congressman-intros-rangel-rule-eliminating-irs-late-fees/|publisher=[[Fox News]]}}</ref>

Carter introduced a "Privileged Resolution" that would have forced the resignation of Rangel from his position as [[House Ways and Means Committee]] Chair after he declined to resign voluntarily <ref>{{cite web|title=New Rangel Financial Violations Demand Removal from Ways and Means Chairmanship
|date=|url=http://carter.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=40&parentid=6&sectiontree=6,40&itemid=1038|publisher=John Carter's House Page}}</ref> citing the inaction of the House Democratic Caucus and the ongoing investigations as reasons. The resolution failed but it was noted that two [[Mississippi]] Democrats, [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] and [[Travis Childers]], broke party ranks and voted with Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Charlie Rangel retains Ways and Means gavel|date=|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1009/28038.html|publisher=Politico}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Democrats rebuff Rangel resolution|date=|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/62061-democrats-rebuff-rangel-resolution|publisher=The Hill}}</ref>

Although a critic of the accuracy of Rangel's financial disclosures, Carter voluntarily amended his financial disclosure forms in mid-October 2009 to list nearly $300,000 in capital gains from the sale of Exxon stock in 2006 and 2007. Though Carter listed the sale of the assets, he did not list the actual amount of capital gains, on which he did pay taxes.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carter Refiling Disclosure Forms to List Exxon Profits|date=|url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/55_45/news/39780-1.html}}</ref>

On November 16, 2009, Carter introduced legislation to give combatant casualty status to the victims of the [[2009 Fort Hood shooting]], similar to those who were killed in Afghanistan and Iraq.<ref>{{cite web|title=Carter's Resolution for Fort Hood Victims|date=|url=http://carter.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=40&sectiontree=6,40&itemid=1081}}</ref>

In February 2010, after Charlie Rangel was found to have broken House rules, Carter again demanded that Rangel step down. Rangel later stepped down, avoiding a third attempt at a privileged resolution to remove Rangel. Ever after stepping down, Carter continued to demand that Democrats comply by their promises of running the "most ethical Congress in history" and to "drain the swamp" that were made in 2006 after Democrats took over the House.

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2010#District 31}}
Carter retired from the bench in 2001 in order to run for Congress in the newly created 31st District. After finishing second in the primary, he defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff — which was [[tantamount to election]] in this heavily Republican district. He has been reelected twice without facing serious opposition.

Carter originally represented a district that stretched from the suburbs of Austin to the fringes of the Houston suburbs, and also included [[College Station]], home of [[Texas A&M University]]. As a result of the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], however, Carter now represents a district stretching from the fringes of the [[Metroplex]] through more rural portions of Central Texas.  The 31st District now includes [[Fort Hood]], home of the U.S. Army's [[3d Cavalry Regiment]] and the [[1st Cavalry Division (United States)|1st Cavalry Division]].

==Personal life==
He has been married to Erika Carter for almost 40 years, and they have four grown children. Since 1971, he has lived in [[Round Rock]], just north of [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].
