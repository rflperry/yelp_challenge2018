In a town-hall forum in [[Canton, Ohio|Canton]], in September, 2010, Renacci was accused of stating that civil rights issues should be addressed by local governments, stating that the solution is "to get our federal government out of the way" because "it's not the federal government's job".  But a reporter from the ''Christian Science Monitor'' who was at the event noted Renacci's words were twisted by a reference to the blight in local communities.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/archives/individual/2010_09/025575.php |title=Another Setback for the GOP's Minority Outreach |publisher=Washington Monthly |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://onespot.wsj.com/politics/2010/09/08/a/692656731-gop-house-candidate-on-civil/ |title=GOP House Candidate On Civil Rights: 'We Need To Get Our Federal Government Out Of The Way' |publisher=Wall Street Journal |date= |accessdate=2010-09-09}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cantonrep.com/news/x907387236/Crashing-Renaccis-party-Boccieri-had-help-from-supporters |title=Crashing Renacci's party: Supporters helped Boccieri |publisher=Canton Repository |date=2010-09-14 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Election-2010/House/2010/0917/Rise-of-the-YouTube-ambush-in-Election-2010-a-case-study |title=Rise of the YouTube ambush in Election 2010: a case study |publisher=Christian Science Monitor |date=2010-09-17 |accessdate=2010-10-04}}</ref>

[[The Plain Dealer]] reported in September 2011 that the new district map of Ohio would place Congressman [[Betty Sutton]] in “a largely Republican district that's being constructed to favor Renacci.”<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2011/09/new_remap_will_give_democrats.html |title=Betty Sutton and Dennis Kucinich to be squeezed out in new congressional remap |publisher=[[The Plain Dealer]] |date=2011-09-12 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref> In December, Sutton filed to run against Renacci.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/Betty_Sutton_Jim_Renacci_Ohio_Member_Vs_Member-210851-1.html |title=Betty Sutton Running Against Freshman Republican in Member-Vs.-Member Race: Roll Call Politics |publisher=[[Roll Call]] |date=2011-12-07 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>  Later that month, [[Roll Call]] reported that a poll taken at least two months earlier showed the two congress members “neck and neck at 45 percent.”<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/poll_tight_race_betty_sutton_jim_renacci_ohio-211091-1.html |title=Poll Shows Tight Race for Betty Sutton in Ohio |publisher=[[Roll Call]] |date=2011-12-15 |accessdate=2012-05-15}}</ref>   On the [[Washington Post|Washington Post's]] list of top 10 House races in 2012, Sutton's was at #8.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/post/the-top-10-battles-between-members-of-congress-in-2012/2011/07/08/gIQA2uyo3H_blog.html |title=The top 10 battled between Members of Congress in 2012 |publisher=[[Washington Post]] |date= 2011-07-11|accessdate=2012-05-15 |first=Aaron |last=Blake}}</ref>

Renacci defeated Sutton by a 52% to 48% margin on Election Day.

===Tenure===
In May 2012, a Renacci campaign contributor was the subject of a [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] probe into $100,000 of campaign contributions made by employees of an Ohio-based direct marketing corporation, Suarez Corporation Industries, to Renacci's campaign. Many of the non-executive employees had never donated to a campaign before and owned modest homes, yet were reported as donating the maximum legal amount of $5,000 to Renacci. The investigation was sparked by prior ''[[Toledo Blade]]'' reports of the alleged violations of federal campaign finance law prohibiting a donor from contributing in another's name and prohibiting a corporation from using bonuses or other methods of reimbursing employees for their contributions. Renacci’s campaign returned all of the donations.<ref>{{cite news | first = Tony | last = Cook | title = Campaign donations prompt FBI probe | date = May 21, 2012 | url = http://www.toledoblade.com/Politics/2012/05/21/U-S-Attorney-General-s-Office-investigating-campaign-contributions-to-Ohio-Treasurer-Josh-Mandel-U-S-Rep-Jim-Renacci.html | work = [[Toledo Blade]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | first = Alec | last = MacGillis | title = The Battleground | date = May 18, 2012 | url = http://www.tnr.com/article/politics/magazine/103409/ohio-battleground-state-election-2012-labor-union-sb5-sherrod-brown-john-kasich | work = [[The New Republic]] | accessdate = June 23, 2012}}</ref>
