The district includes the western half of [[Detroit]], as well as [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]], [[Highland Park, Michigan|Highland Park]], and most of the [[downriver]] suburbs including [[Wyandotte, Michigan|Wyandotte]] and [[Romulus, Michigan|Romulus]].  He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]]. He is currently the second longest-serving incumbent member of the House, after fellow Michigan Democratic Congressman [[John Dingell]] and the second-longest incumbent member of the entire Congress by length of service, also after Dingell.

==Early life, education, and early career==
After graduating from [[Northwestern High School (Michigan)|Northwestern High School]] in [[Detroit]], Conyers served in the [[Michigan National Guard]] 1948–50; [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] 1950–54; and the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserves]] 1954–57. Conyers served for a year in Korea as an officer in the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers|U.S. Army Corps of Engineers]] and was awarded combat and merit citations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aaregistry.org/historic_events/view/one-michigans-finest-john-conyers|title=One of Michigan's finest, John Conyers!|publisher=[[African American Registry]]}}</ref> Conyers grew up in Detroit, and received both his B.A. and his law degree from [[Wayne State University]].

Conyers was present in [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], Alabama, on October 7, 1963, for the [[civil rights movement]] voter registration drive known as Freedom Day.<ref>{{cite book |title=You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train |last=Zinn |first=Howard |authorlink=Howard Zinn |year=1994 |publisher=Beacon Press |isbn= |pages=63–64 }} <!-- Originally cited as: [[Howard Zinn]], ''You Can't Be Neutral on a Moving Train'' [Beacon Press, 1994; new ed. 2002], pp. 63–64 --></ref> He served as an assistant to U.S. Congressman [[John Dingell, Jr.]], prior to his election to Congress.

==Detroit Mayoral campaigns==
While serving in the U.S. House, Conyers made two unsuccessful runs for [[mayor of Detroit]]: one in 1989 against incumbent [[Coleman Young]] and again in 1993.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0207/2635.html |title=In Mayor's Races, Capitol Hill Often Doesn't Lead to City Hall |publisher=Politico | date=May 2, 2007}}</ref>

===1989===
Incumbent Democratic Mayor [[Coleman A. Young|Coleman Young]] decided to run for a fifth term, despite growing unpopularity and the declining economy of Detroit. In the September primary, Young won with 51% of the vote. Accountant Tom Barrow qualified for the November run off by getting second place with 24% and Conyers got third place with 18% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/14/us/detroit-mayor-easily-wins-primary-but-faces-runoff.html?src=pm | work=The New York Times | title=Detroit Mayor Easily Wins Primary but Faces Runoff | date=September 14, 1989}}</ref> Young defeated Barrow in the run off with 56% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=DM&p_theme=dm&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0ED3D0AF33EA984C&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM |title=Detroit's Young wins again|publisher=The Dallas Morning News|date=November 8, 1989}}</ref>

===1993===
In June 1993, incumbent Democratic Mayor [[Coleman A. Young|Coleman Young]] decided to retire instead of seeking a sixth term, citing his age and health, although many believed he decided not to run because of his growing unpopularity. In a ''[[Detroit News]]'' poll in February, 81% said Young should retire.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/72163622.html?dids=72163622:72163622&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jun+23%2C+1993&author=Edward+Walsh&pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&desc=Detroit+Mayor+Bars+New+Race%3B+Scramble+to+Succeed+Young+Is+Assured&pqatl=google | first=Edward | last=Walsh | title=Detroit Mayor Bars New Race; Scramble to Succeed Young Is Assured | date=June 23, 1993}}</ref> Conyers was one of the 23 candidates who qualified for ballot access.<ref>{{cite news|last=Holewa|first=Lisa|title=23 candidates hope to replace Detroit mayor|url=http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=jpIiAAAAIBAJ&sjid=9a4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=2980,3555375&dq=john+conyers+mayor&hl=en|newspaper=The Item|date=September 14, 1993}}</ref> [[Dennis Archer]] was a clear front runner from the beginning.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
[[File:John Conyers 1977 Congressional photo.jpg|thumb|180px|left|An earlier congressional photo of Conyers]]

===Elections===
In 1964, he ran for an open seat in what was then the 1st District, and defeated Republican Robert Blackwell with 84% of the vote. He was reelected 13 times with even larger margins. After the [[1990 United States Census]], Michigan lost a congressional district and Conyers's district was renumbered to the [[Michigan's 14th congressional district|14th district]]. In 1992, he won re-election to his 15th term in his new district with 82% of the vote against Republican nominee John Gordon. He won re-election another nine times after that. His worst re-election performance was in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010]], when he got 77% of the vote against Republican nominee Don Ukrainec.

In total, he has won re-election twenty-three times and has served twenty-four terms. He is the second longest-serving current member of the House, as well as after World War II.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voteview.com/Is_John_Kerry_A_Liberal.htm |title=Is John Kerry A Liberal? |publisher=Voteview.com |date=October 13, 2004 |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>  He is the second-longest serving member of either house of Congress in Michigan's history, trailing only his former boss, Dingell. He is also the last member of the large Democratic freshman class of 1964 who is still serving in the House.

In May 2014, Wayne County Clerk Cathy Garrett determined that Conyers had not submitted enough valid nominating petition signatures to appear on the August 2014 Primary Election ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.mlive.com/news/detroit/index.ssf/2014/05/invalid_petitions_could_keep_u.html |title=Invalid petitions could keep U.S. Rep.

However, on May 23, Federal District Judge Matthew Leitman issued an injunction placing Conyers back on the ballot, ruling that the requirement that circulators be registered voters was similar to an Ohio law previously found unconstitutional by a Federal appeals court in 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/us-rep-conyers-loses-appeal-ballot-23845096 |title=Judge Allows US Rep.

===Tenure===
Conyers is one of the 13 founding members of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] (CBC) and is considered the Dean of that group. Formed in 1969, the CBC was founded to strengthen African-American lawmakers' ability to address the legislative concerns of Black and minority citizens. He has served longer in Congress than any other African American. In 1971, he was one of the original members of [[Nixon's Enemies List]].

In 1965, John Conyers won a seat as a freshman on the influential [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]], which was then under the leadership of Democratic Congressman [[Emanuel Celler]] of New York. At the time, the assignment was an elite one, as Judiciary ranked behind only [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means]] and [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] in terms of the number of Members who sought assignment there.<ref>http://baic.house.gov/education/lesson-plans/essay3.pdf</ref>

According to the ''[[National Journal]]'', Conyers has been considered, with [[Pete Stark]], [[John Lewis (politician)|John Lewis]], [[Jim McDermott]], and [[Barbara Lee]], to be one of the most [[liberalism in the United States|liberal]] members of Congress for many years. [[American Civil Rights Movement (1955–1968)|Civil rights]] icon [[Rosa Parks]] served on Conyers' staff between 1965 and 1988.

Conyers is known as one of the opponents of the drive to regulate [[online gambling]]. He has likened the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act of 2006]], hidden within the [[SAFE Port Act]], to Prohibition.

After Martin Luther King, Jr.'s assassination in 1968, Conyers introduced the first bill in Congress to make King's birthday a national holiday. It is now celebrated as [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]].

Conyers introduced the "Commission to Study Reparation Proposals for African Americans Act" (H.R. 40) in January 1989, and has re-introduced anew this bill each congressional term. This bill calls for the creation of a commission to research the history of [[slavery]] and its effects on current America, resulting in recommendations on how to remedy this injustice. Its current version was introduced and referred to committee on January 3, 2013.<ref>http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/reparations and https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr40</ref>

Conyers first introduced the House of Resolution 40 in 1989, and have annual proposed this act until it is approved and passed. The House Resolution 40 expresses the impact of slavery's brutal institution on today's society, politics, and economy. "My bill does four things:
It acknowledges the fundamental injustice and inhumanity of slavery
It establishes a commission to study slavery, its subsequent racial and economic discrimination against freed slaves;
It studies the impact of those forces on today's living African Americans; and
The commission would then make recommendations to Congress on appropriate remedies to redress the harm inflicted on living African Americans."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Conyers|first1=John|title=Reparations|url=http://conyers.house.gov/index.cfm/reparations|website=http://conyers.house.gov|publisher=John Conyers|accessdate=October 24, 2014}}</ref>

;Nixon and Watergate
Conyers was critical of [[Richard Nixon]] during his tenure, and as a result was number 13 on [[President of the United States|President]] [[Richard Nixon]]'s [[Nixon's Enemies List|enemies list]] during Nixon's 1969–74 presidential tenure. The president's Chief Counsel described him as "coming on fast," and that he was "emerging" as a "black anti-Nixon spokesman."<ref>http://www.enemieslist.info/enemy.php?ID=13</ref><ref>Also see Wikisource transcription of Nixon's enemies list</ref>

Conyers voted on the [[Articles of Impeachment]] against Nixon in July 1974. He is the last remaining member of the House Judiciary Committee who did so, although another fellow Committee member, Democratic Congressman [[Charles B. Rangel]], of New York, is still in Congress.

;National Health Care Act
The [[United States National Health Care Act]] (Expanded and Improved Medicare for All Act) (H.R. 676) is a bill submitted to the United States House of Representatives by Conyers which, as of September 29, 2008, has 93 cosponsors. It was first introduced, with 25 cosponsors, in 2003,<ref>{{USBill|108|HR|676}}</ref> and reintroduced each session since then. The act calls for the creation of a universal [[single-payer health care]] system in the United States, in which the government would provide every resident health care free of charge.  In order to eliminate disparate treatment between richer and poorer Americans, the Act would also prohibit private insurers from covering any treatment or procedure already covered by the Act. The bill is currently in the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce]]'s Subcommittee on Health.

;Downing Street memo
On May 5, 2005, Conyers and 88 other members of Congress wrote an open letter to the White House inquiring about the [[Downing Street memo]], a leaked memorandum that revealed an apparent secret agreement between the United States and the United Kingdom to [[2003 Invasion of Iraq|attack Iraq]] in 2002. ''[[The Times]]'' reported that newly discovered documents reveal British and U.S. intentions to invade Iraq and leaders of the two countries had "discussed creating pretextual justifications for doing so." The documents go on to say that [[Tony Blair]] decided the United States would need to "create" conditions to justify the war.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

The memo story broke in the United Kingdom, but did not receive much coverage in the United States, prompting Conyers to lament: "This should not be allowed to fall down the memory hole during wall-to-wall coverage of the [[People v. Jackson|Michael Jackson trial]] and a [[Jennifer Wilbanks|runaway bride]]."<ref>{{cite news|last=Brown, Jr.|first=Sylvester|title=Conyers looks for news in the wrong place|accessdate=February 21, 2011|newspaper=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]|date=May 15, 2005|page=D2}}</ref> Conyers and others reportedly considered sending a congressional investigation delegation to London.<ref>Tony Allen-Mills and Tom Pattinson, "[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-1622378,00.html Blair faces US probe over secret Iraq invasion plan]" ''The Times'', May 22, 2005.</ref>

;''What Went Wrong In Ohio''
In May, 2005, Conyers released ''[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http://www.iwantmyvote.com/lib/downloads/references/house_judiciary/final_status_report.pdf What Went Wrong In Ohio: The Conyers Report On The 2004 Presidential Election]'', which discusses the [[2004 United States election voting controversies|voting irregularities]] in the state of [[Ohio]] during the [[2004 U.S. Presidential Election]]. The evidence offered consists of statistical abnormalities in the differences between [[exit poll]] results and actual votes registered at those locations. The book also discusses reports of faulty [[electronic voting]] machines and the lack of credibility of those machines used to tally votes.

He was one of 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].<ref>{{cite web |date=January 6, 2005 |url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml |title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7 |publisher=clerk.house.gov |accessdate=February 22, 2008}}</ref>

;The Constitution in Crisis
{{see also|Lead-up to the Iraq War|Legitimacy of the 2003 invasion of Iraq}}
On August 4, 2006, Conyers released his report, ''The Constitution in Crisis: The Downing Street Minutes and Deception, Manipulation, Torture, Retributions and Cover-ups in the Iraq War,'' an edited collection of information intended to serve as evidence that the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush Administration]] altered [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] to justify the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].

''The Constitution in Crisis'' examines much of the evidence presented by the Bush Administration prior to the invasion and questions the credibility of their sources of intelligence. In addition, the document investigates the conditions that led to the [[Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse|torture scandal]] at [[Abu Ghraib prison]] in Iraq, as well as further evidence of [[torture]] having been committed but not made known to the public. Finally, the document reports on a series of "smear tactics" purportedly used by the administration in dealing with its political adversaries.

The document calls for the [[censure]] of President [[George W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Notably, however, Conyers refused to back [[Efforts to impeach George W. Bush|impeachment]] proceedings.

;On anti-Muslim intolerance
Conyers has proposed [http://www.conyersblog.us/archives/00000103.htm House Resolution 288], which condemns “religious intolerance” but emphasizes [[Islam]] as needing special protection from acts of violence and intolerance. It states that “it should never be official policy of the United States Government to disparage the [[Quran]], Islam, or any religion in any way, shape, or form,” and “calls upon local, State, and Federal authorities to work to prevent [[hate crime|bias-motivated crime]]s and acts against all individuals, including those of the Islamic faith.” The bill was referred [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.res.00288: to the House subcommittee on the Constitution] in June 2005.

;Conyers v. Bush
''See also [[Conyers v. Bush]]''

In April 2006 Conyers, together with ten other senior [[Member of Congress|congressmen]], filed an action in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan|U.S. District Court in the Eastern District of Michigan, Southern Division]], challenging the constitutionality of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]]. The complaint alleged the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]] was not afforded due consideration by the [[United States Congress]] before being signed by the President.<ref>[http://www.elderlawanswers.com/resources/article.asp?id=5988&section=4&state= ''The DRA One Year Later: Dems Waiting for Outcome of Legal Challenges to Law That Stiffens Medicaid Transfer Penalties''] from [http://www.ElderLawAnswers.com ElderLawAnswers.com], February 10, 2007</ref> The action was subsequently dismissed on grounds of lack of [[Standing (law)|standing]].<ref>{{cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2633701 |title=Judge Dismisses Budget Bill Lawsuit |date=November 6, 2006 |accessdate=November 28, 2006 |work=ABC News |agency=Associated Press}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

;Ethics controversy
In letters sent separately to the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]], the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]], and the US Attorney's office, two former aides of Conyers alleged that Conyers used his staff to work on several local and state campaigns, and forced them to baby-sit and chauffeur his children.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/04/12/griffin.conyers/index.html | work=CNN | title=CNN.com – Congressman accused of using staff to baby-sit – Apr 12, 2006 | accessdate=May 6, 2010}}</ref> In late December 2006, Conyers "accepted responsibility" for possibly violating House rules. A statement issued December 29, 2006, by the House Ethics Committee Chairman [[Doc Hastings]] (R-WA) and Ranking Minority Member [[Howard Berman]] (D-CA), said that ''Conyers acknowledged what he characterized as a "lack of clarity" in his communications with staff members regarding their official duties and responsibilities, and accepted responsibility for his actions.'' In deciding to drop the matter, Hastings and Berman stated: <blockquote>After reviewing the information gathered during the inquiry, and in light of Representative Conyers’ cooperation with the inquiry, we have concluded that this matter should be resolved through the issuance of this public statement and the agreement by Representative Conyers to take a number of additional, significant steps to ensure that his office complies with all rules and standards regarding campaign and personal work by congressional staff.<ref>[http://www.thehill.com:8888/thehill/opencms/TheHill/News/Frontpage/121306/conyers.html Conyers accepts responsibility for possible ethics violations]</ref></blockquote>

Also, in 1992, he was implicated in the [[House banking scandal]].

;Copyright controversy
Conyers has come under fire from scientific and taxpayers' advocacy groups<ref>[http://www.taxpayeraccess.org/action/HR801-09-0211.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> for repeatedly introducing a bill that would overturn [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] Public Access Policy, and forbid the government from mandating that federally funded research be made freely available to the public.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wo.ala.org/districtdispatch/?p=1945 |title=Conyers Introduces H.R. 801, "The Fair Copyright in Research Works Act" &#124; District Dispatch |publisher=Wo.ala.org |date=February 13, 2009 |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref> Critics assert that Conyers has been influenced by publishing houses who have contributed significant money to Conyers.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/lawrence-lessig-and-michael-eisen/is-john-conyers-shilling_b_171189.html |title=Lawrence Lessig and Michael Eisen: Is John Conyers Shilling for Special Interests? |work=Huffington Post |date= March 2, 2009|accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

On January 13, 2009, the House Committee on the Judiciary, led by Conyers, released "Reining in the Imperial Presidency: Lessons and Recommendations Relating to the Presidency of George W. Bush," a 486-page report detailing alleged abuses of power that occurred during the [[George W.

;Bill reading controversy
In late July 2009, Conyers, commenting on the [[Health care in the United States|healthcare debate]] in the [[United States House|House]], stated: “I love these members, they get up and say, ‘Read the bill'... What good is reading the bill if it’s a thousand pages and you don’t have two days and two lawyers to find out what it means after you read the bill?” His remark brought criticism from [[government transparency]] advocates such as the [[Sunlight Foundation]], which referred to [http://readthebill.org readthebill.org] in response.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2009/07/27/rep-conyers-dont-read-the-bill/|author=Paul Blumenthal|title=Rep.

;Response to accusations regarding American Muslim spies
{{Main|Muslim Mafia (book)}}
In October, Conyers responded to allegations from four Republican Congress Members, in the wake of the launch of the book ''[[Muslim Mafia]]'', that the [[Council on American-Islamic Relations]] (CAIR) sought to plant Muslim "spies" in [[Capitol Hill]]. He strongly opposed the accusations, saying:

{{cquote|It shouldn't need to be said in 2009, and after the historic election of our first African-American president, but let me remind all my colleagues that patriotic Americans of all races, religions, and beliefs have the right – and the responsibility – to participate in our political process, including by volunteering to work in Congressional offices. Numerous Muslim-American interns have served the House ably and they deserve our appreciation and respect, not attacks on their character or patriotism.<ref>{{cite web|last=O'Brien |first=Michael |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/63325-conyers-blasts-gop-lawmakers-accusations-of-muslim-spies |title=Conyers blasts GOP lawmakers' accusations of Muslim 'spies' – The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Thehill.com |date=October 15, 2009 |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>}}

Conyers was one of the first three U.S. Congress members to condemn the allegations, joining [[André Carson]] (D-[[Indiana|IN]]) and [[Loretta Sanchez]] (D-[[California|CA]]).

;WikiLeaks
At a December 16, 2010 hearing of the [[House Judiciary Committee]] on the subject of "the [[Espionage Act of 1917|Espionage Act]] and the Legal and [[United States Constitution|Constitutional]] Issues Raised by [[WikiLeaks]],"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/hear_101216.html |title=Website of the House Judiciary Committee |publisher=Judiciary.house.gov |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=March 23, 2011}}</ref> Conyers "argue[d] strongly against prosecuting [[WikiLeaks]] in haste—or at all."<ref name=WikiHearing>Elliott, Justin (December 16, 2010) [http://www.salon.com/news/wikileaks/index.html?story=/politics/war_room/2010/12/16/conyers_on_wikileaks Top Dem sticks up for WikiLeaks], ''[[Salon.com]]''</ref> He strongly defended the [[whistleblowing]] organization, saying:

<blockquote>
"As an initial matter, there is no doubt that WikiLeaks is very unpopular right now.  Many feel that the WikiLeaks publication was offensive. But being unpopular is not a crime, and publishing offensive information is not either. And the repeated calls from politicians, journalists, and other so-called experts crying out for criminal prosecutions or other extreme measures make me very uncomfortable. Indeed, when everyone in [[Washington, D.C.|this town]] is joined together calling for someone’s head, that is it a pretty strong sign we need to slow down and take a closer look.... [L]et us not be hasty, and let us not legislate in a climate of fear or prejudice. For, in such an atmosphere, it is our [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] freedoms and our cherished [[civil rights]] that are the first to be sacrificed in the false service of our [[national security]]."<ref name=WikiHearing/>
</blockquote>

Conyers's statement was "in marked contrast to the repeated calls from other members of [[United States Congress|Congress]] and [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama administration]] officials to prosecute (or kill) WikiLeaks head [[Julian Assange]] immediately."<ref name=WikiHearing/>
