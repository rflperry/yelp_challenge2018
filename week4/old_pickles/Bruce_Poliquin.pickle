He grew up in a family of French-Canadian ancestry, where his father was a school principal and his mother was a nurse [http://gopforme.com/us-senate-race/bruce-poliquin/].  He received a scholarship to attend [[Phillips Academy]] in [[Andover, Massachusetts]] and later attended [[Harvard University]], where he studied economics, graduating in 1976. After leaving Harvard, Poliquin entered private business, including a position with [[BMO Harris Bank|Harris Trust and Savings Bank]] in Chicago.<ref name=AboutUs/> In 1989, he married Jane Carpenter, whom he had known in Waterville, but she died in a swimming accident three years later. He has one son. Poliquin remarried in  2003, and was divorced in 2009.\n\n==Gubernatorial campaign==\nIn [[Maine gubernatorial election, 2010|2010]], Poliquin sought the Maine Republican Party\'s nomination for [[Governor of Maine]]. He spent $711,000 of his own money and over $798,000 in total, but finished sixth of the seven candidates behind winner [[Paul LePage]]. After his unsuccessful bid, Poliquin campaigned strongly for LePage, calling him a true [[fiscal conservative]].<ref name=Nov21/> Following the election of Republican [[Paul LePage]] in November 2010, Poliquin was elected by the state legislature to serve as state Treasurer.<ref name="Nov21">{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2010/11/21/politics/as-legislators-pick-state-officers-lepage-endorsement-for-treasurer-irks-some/|title=As legislators pick state officers, LePage endorsement for treasurer irks some|last=Miller|first=Kevin|date=November 21, 2010|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>\n\n==State Treasurer==\nIn the fall 2011, Poliquin criticized the [[Maine State Housing Authority]] for its plans to underwrite federal tax credits to redevelop an historic property in Portland\'s [[West End (Portland, Maine)|West End]], [[68 High Street]]. The vacant lot at 66 High Street and 68 High Street were planned to turn into Elm Terrace, a low-income facility with 38 units. Poliquin criticized the proposed unit price of $314,000. [[Dale McCormick]], the authority\'s director and an appointee by [[Maine Democratic Party|Democratic]] Governor [[John Baldacci]], approved the proposal following a reduction in the per unit price to $265,000. McCormick noted that the average per unit cost in the West End was approximately $220,000 and the building had to be rebuilt to include elevators and other code requirements, while Poliquin argued that it was better and more cost effective to place low income housing on the outskirts of towns and cities.<ref name="Miller">{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2011/12/11/business/controversial-elm-terrace-development-gets-ok-at-265k-per-unit/|title=Controversial Elm Terrace development gets OK at $265K per uni|last=Miller|first=Kevin|date=December 11, 2011|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=12 December 2011}}</ref>\n\nIn February of 2012, Poliquin faced criticism from Democrats over allegations that he conducted commerce while serving as State Treasurer, which would have been a violation of Article V, Part 3 of the [[Maine Constitution]]. One allegation involved his ownership of the Popham Beach Club, a private club in [[Phippsburg, Maine|Phippsburg]], where he appeared before the Planning Board in a matter involving the club. A second alleged instance of commerce involved his real estate company Dirigo Holdings LLC. [[Maine Attorney General]] [[William Schneider (politician)|William Schneider]] advised Poliquin to disassociate himself from his business ventures but did not offer an opinion as to whether he had actually violated the Constitution. The [[Maine Legislature]], after pressure from Democrats, voted 122-0 to send the matter to the [[Maine Supreme Judicial Court]] for review, but the Court declined to do so. <ref name="Consider">{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/29/politics/treasurer-poliquin-cleared-by-maine-supreme-court/|title=Maine House asks high court to look into Treasurer Poliquin\xe2\x80\x99s business dealings|last=Russell|first=Eric|date=March 1, 2012|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref> <ref name="Ruling">{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2012/03/29/politics/treasurer-poliquin-cleared-by-maine-supreme-court/|title=Maine Supreme Court says it won\xe2\x80\x99t rule in Poliquin complaint|last=Russell|first=Eric|date=March 29, 2012|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=4 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nIn February of 2012 Poliquin faced criticism from the left over his use of the Tree Growth Tax Program, a program meant to preserve forestland from development pressures for commercial timber harvesting, with 10 acres of his oceanfront property in [[Georgetown, Maine|Georgetown]].  The program reduced the value of his property from the originally assessed $1.8 million to $725,500, resulting in Poliquin paying $30 a year in property taxes on the otherwise valuable land.<ref name="Georgetown"></ref> A [[Maine Forest Service]] report in 2009 discussed Poliquin\'s property as an example of a property that may not be fully complying with the law, stating that restrictions on timber harvesting in shoreland areas would limit any commercial use of the land.  They did state, however, that as long as the property was 10 acres, it could remain in the program. <ref name="Tree Growth">{{cite news|url=http://www.kjonline.com/news/poliquin-property-tax-relief-queried_2012-02-01.html|title=Poliquin property tax relief questioned|last=Cover|first=Susan|date=February 2, 2012|work=[[Kennebec Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>  \n\nPoliquin later transferred the property in question to the Open Space program, a less generous tax abatement program.  The Georgetown [[Board of Selectmen]] unanimously approved the transfer, and declined to pursue penalties for removing the property from Tree Growth. Poliquin denied that he took his actions due to any alleged improper use of the Tree Growth program, and stated that the issue was a distraction for Georgetown and was politically motivated due to Democrats\' dissatisfaction with his policies as Treasurer.<ref name="Georgetown">{{cite news|url=http://www.kjonline.com/news/Poliquin-to-transfer-land-to-different-tax-break-program.html|title=Poliquin to transfer land to different tax-break program|last=Mistler|first=Steve|date=June 27, 2012|work=[[Kennebec Journal]]|accessdate=5 January 2013}}</ref>\n\nAt the end of his term, Poliquin wrote an op-ed in the \'\'Bangor Daily News\'\' with a list of his offices\' accomplishments as Treasurer. These included reforms to the state workers\' pension plan, efforts to reduce the cost of affordable housing, reduced wasteful spending, and retention of the state\'s Aa2 bond rating, among other initiatives. <ref name="accomplishments">{{cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2013/01/05/opinion/contributors/thanks-from-maine-treasurer/|title=Thanks from Maine Treasurer|last=Poliquin|first=Bruce|date=January 5, 2013|work=[[Bangor Daily News]]|accessdate=7 January 2013}}</ref>\n\n==Post-Treasurer career==\nIn March 2012, Poliquin announced he would be running for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by [[Olympia Snowe]].<ref>http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/213915-maines-gop-state-treasurer-to-run-for-snowe-seat|title=Maine\'s GOP state treasurer to run for Snow seat|last=Lederman|first=Josh|date=2 March 2012</ref>  He lost the Republican primary to [[Charlie Summers]], who himself lost to Independent former Gov.
