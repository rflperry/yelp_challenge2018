He will take office on January 3, 2015.\n\n==Career==\nBlum attended [[Loras College]] where he earned a degree in finance, and the [[University of Dubuque]] where he earned a master\xe2\x80\x99s degree in business administration. A businessman, Blum is a former CEO of Eagle Point Software (1990&ndash;2000) and owner of Digital Canal, a software company, since 2000.<ref>http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/05/09/iowa-election-rod-blum-bio-issues/8924985/</ref><ref name="iowarepub">http://theiowarepublican.com/2011/rod-blum-announces-campaign-for-congress-in-1st-cd/</ref>\n\n==Personal life==\nBlum, the son of a [[World War II]] veteran, was born and raised in Dubuque. He resides there with his wife, Karen and five children.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/135714</ref> He is an [[Episcopal]] Christian.<ref name="iowarepub" />\n\n==Controversy==\nBlum was listed in the bankruptcy filing of professional hockey player [[Jack Johnson (ice hockey)]]. Johnson, who was to be paid $5 million in salary from the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] during the 2014-15 [[National Hockey League]] season, filed for federal bankruptcy on October 7, 2014, claiming assets of less than $50,000 and debts of more than $10 million. On November 20, 2014, \'\'[[The Columbus Dispatch]]\'\' reported that Blum made a $2 million loan to Johnson\'s family on March 10, 2011, at an interest rate of 12 percent. Blum sued Johnson within a month of the loan being made, and Johnson signed a settlement that allowed Blum to garnish 25 percent of Johnson\'s salary over much of the past two seasons to repay the debt.<ref>http://bluejacketsxtra.dispatch.com/content/stories/2014/11/20/blind-sided.html</ref>\n\nThe newspaper reported Blum\'s loan was one of several taken out by Johnson\'s parents, relying on Johnson\'s future earnings, to pay for an expensive house in [[Manhattan Beach, California]], as well as luxury cars and travel. Several loans, as well as the mortgage on the California house, went into default.\n\nA spokesman for Blum provided a written statement on November 20, 2014, to the Radio Iowa news network that "this is a difficult time for the Johnson family, and out of respect for their privacy Mr. Blum will not be discussing their private financial situation as the legal process takes its course.".<ref>http://www.radioiowa.com/2014/11/20/congressman-elect-blum-listed-in-bankruptcy-filing-loaned-hockey-stars-family-2-million/</ref>\n\n==References==\n{{reflist}}\n\n==External links==\n*[http://rodblum.com/ 2014 campaign website]\n\n<!--{{S-start}}\n{{s-par|us-hs}}\n{{USRepSuccessionBox |\n  state=Iowa|\n  district=1 |\n  before=[[Bruce Braley]] |\n  start=2015\n}}\n{{S-end}}-->\n\n{{Persondata <!-- Metadata: see [[Wikipedia:Persondata]]. -->\n| NAME              =Blum, Rod\n| ALTERNATIVE NAMES =\n| SHORT DESCRIPTION = American politician\n| DATE OF BIRTH     = February 26, 1955\n| PLACE OF BIRTH    = [[Dubuque, Iowa]], U.S.\n| DATE OF DEATH     =\n| PLACE OF DEATH    =\n}}\n{{DEFAULTSORT:Blum, Rod}}\n[[Category:Living people]]\n[[Category:1955 births]]\n[[Category:Politicians from Dubuque, Iowa]]\n[[Category:Loras College alumni]]\n[[Category:University of Dubuque alumni]]\n[[Category:Iowa Republicans]]\n[[Category:American Episcopalians]]\n[[Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from Iowa]]\n[[Category:Republican Party members of the United States House of Representatives]]'
