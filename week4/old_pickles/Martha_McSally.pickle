General [[Tommy Franks]], then commander of the [[United States Central Command]] (USCENTCOM), announced in 2002 that U.S. military servicewomen would no longer be required to wear the abaya, although they would be "encouraged" to do so as a show of respect for local customs. Commenting on the change, Central Command spokesman, Colonel Rick Thomas, said it was not made because of McSally\'s lawsuit, but had already been "under review" before the lawsuit was filed. News reports noted that McSally had been fighting for a change in the policy for seven years, and had filed the lawsuit after she had been threatened with a [[court martial]] if she did not comply and wear the abaya.<ref name="relents">{{cite news|last=Russell|first=Jan Jarboe|title=Pentagon relents on Arabic dress policy for women|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/local/opinion/article/Pentagon-relents-on-Arabic-dress-policy-for-women-1078347.php|accessdate=July 16, 2011|newspaper=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|date=January 24, 2002}}</ref> Critics of the policy noted that while female military personnel had been required to wear the abaya, the situation was not the same for "women diplomats" of the [[U.S. Department of State]] assigned to the U.S. Embassy in [[Riyadh]], who were actually encouraged \'\'not\'\' to wear the abaya when they were involved in official business, "...because they are representing the United States."
