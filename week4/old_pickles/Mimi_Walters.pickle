She previously represented the 33rd Senate District from 2008 to 2012 before redistricting.{{cn|date=November 2014}}  She also served in the California State Assembly from 2004 to 2008, where she served in the Republican leadership as Assistant Republican [[Floor Leader|Leader]] and Vice Chair of the [[Appropriation (law)|Appropriations]] Committee.\n\nOn November 4, 2014, Walters was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[CA-45|California\xe2\x80\x99s 45th congressional district]], which is being vacated by Congressman [[John B.T. Campbell III|John Campbell]]. She was subsequently elected by her colleagues as the Freshman Class Representative to the [[House Republican Conference]] leadership team for the [[114th United States Congress]].\n\n==Early years and education==\nWalters earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Political Science]] from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 1984. Before her election to the [[California State Assembly]], Walters was a [[stockbroker]].\n\n==Political career==\nWalters was Councilwoman and Mayor of [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]] during 1996\xe2\x80\x932004, and helped defeat efforts to convert [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] to a commercial airport.\n\nWalters was elected in 2004 to represent the 73rd Assembly District, which includes coastal [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] county communities of [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]], [[Laguna Hills, California|Laguna Hills]], [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]], [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], and [[Aliso Viejo, California|Aliso Viejo]].\n\nSince the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision \'\'[[Kelo v. City of New London|Kelo v. New London]]\'\' in June 2005, Walters has been at the forefront of amending California government acquisition and the regulation of private property laws. She introduced two bills, AB 590 and AB 1990, in the 2005-06 session on these topics.  After both bills failed in committee by party line votes, Walters became a leading figure in the campaign for [[California Proposition 90|Proposition 90]].  She was named honorary chair of the Save Our Homes initiative campaign.  Supporters of Proposition 90 referred to their effort as protecting property rights.  The initiative received over one million signatures to qualify for the November 2006 ballot.  Proposition 90 failed with 47.6% of the vote.\n\nIn the 2007-2008 session, Walters introduced ACA 2, a state Constitutional Amendment to change government acquisition and the regulation of private property by California local governments.\n\nWalters introduced a package of bills in February 2011 to address the California pension crisis, SB 520 through SB 528.<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/03/06/3453456/pensions-emerge-as-key-issue-in.html Pensions Emerge as Key Issue]</ref>\n\nIn an op-ed written by Senator Walters in October of 2012, Walters questioned the wisdom of creating a state-run retirement pension plan for private-sector workers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walters|first=Mimi|title=State-Run Private Sector Retirement Plans Subsidized by Taxpayers Coming in 2013|url=http://district37.cssrc.us/content/state-run-private-sector-retirement-plans-subsidized-taxpayers-coming-2013}}</ref>   The bill, SB 1234, established the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program for private-sector workers that requires employers that may not offer retirement plans to participate in the program.<ref>{{cite web|first=California Legislature|title=SB1234|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1234}}</ref> \n\nWalters is the co-founder of the California Women\xe2\x80\x99s Leadership Association (CWLA.)

She has also served on the Boards of the [[National Association of Women Business Owners]] (NAWBO,) the Laguna Niguel Republican Women Federated, the [[American Cancer Society]], and the South Coast Medical Center Foundation.\n\n===2010 California State Treasurer election===\nIn January 2010, Walters announced that she would run for [[California State Treasurer]] against Democratic incumbent [[Bill Lockyer]]. She became the [[California Republican Party|Republican]] nominee for State Treasurer the following June.\n\n===Investigation by the Fair Political Practices Commission===\nIn early 2012, the Fair Political Practice Commission opened an inquiry as to whether Walters violated conflict-of-interest laws when her office assisted constituents who were having problems receiving feedback from California prison officials regarding the status of a financial claim that Senator Walters husband ultimately had an economic interest in.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=Ethics panel investigates state Sen. Mimi Walters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/local/la-me-walters-ethics-20120615}}</ref> \n\nThe inquiry was disclosed in a written notice to Walters\' attorney by Gary Winuk, chief of enforcement for the state Fair Political Practices Commission. He wrote that his office "will be pursuing an investigation regarding whether or not Sen. Walters violated the Political Reform Act\'s conflict-of-interest prohibitions."<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=Ethics panel investigates state Sen.

Young filed a petition of extraordinary writ<ref>[http://www.steveyoungforcalifornia.com/walters_complaint.pdf Petition of extraordinary writ]</ref> seeking declaratory relief to the California Secretary of State to exclude opponent Mimi Walters from the 2012 election ballot for failing to establish a clear residency status in the district she was running in. Under state law, state legislators are required to live in the districts they represent.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Election Code section 201|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/ELEC/1/d0.5/3/s201}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=California Election Code Section 2040-8041|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&group=08001-09000&file=8040-8041}}</ref> \n\nWalters and her family have long been associated with Laguna Niguel, where she served on the City Council and was elected to two terms in the Assembly and one in the Senate. But last year, the new California Citizens Redistricting Commission re-drew the state\xe2\x80\x99s legislative districts. To run in the newly drawn 37th Senate District, Walters says she moved to Irvine. Young and two registered Republicans who have joined in the suit say Walters\xe2\x80\x99 move was pure fiction. According to the suit, Walters and her husband, David, have lived in a 14,000-square-foot mansion in Laguna Niguel since 1999. Then, this year, the suit says that Walters changed her voter registration to reflect that she\xe2\x80\x99s living in a 570-square-foot apartment in Irvine with no dishwasher or washer/dryer hook ups.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=State Sen.
