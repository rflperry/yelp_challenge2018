===Tenure===
DeLauro is one of the most liberal members of the House.  She is a founding member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].

Rosa DeLauro is active on health policy issues, particularly women's health. She has introduced numerous bills aimed at improving cancer treatment and research and women's health policies.  As chair of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Food and Drug Administration, she has been an outspoken critic of that agency's failures to protect the public from unsafe foods and medical products.

In May 2006, she was linked in press reports to U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]]'s potential bid for President in 2008. On February 2, 2008, DeLauro endorsed Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]] for [[President]] at her home in New Haven, Connecticut.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-delauro0202.artfeb02,0,6935512.story Rosa Will Back Obama - Courant.com]</ref>

On October 3, 2008, DeLauro voted a second time in the House in favor the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] to help stabilize an economic crisis.<ref>[http://www.newstimes.com/danbury/ci_10601034?source=rss <!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> She worked to pass the [[Paycheck Fairness Act]]. She has urged politicians to be "big thinkers" on the issue of [[universal health care]].<ref>[http://www.middletownpress.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18212465&BRD=1645&PAG=461&dept_id=571446&rfi=6 middletownpress.com]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on December 17, 2008, that DeLauro was "a top contender" for the position of [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretary]] in the [[Obama administration]].<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/12/17/shaiken-emerges-as-top-candidate-for-labor-secretary/ Shaiken Emerges as Top Candidate for Labor Secretary]</ref> However, President-elect Obama announced the nomination of fellow congresswoman [[Hilda Solis]] for the position on December 19.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anne E. |last=Kornblut |title=Obama to Announce Final Cabinet Picks |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/18/AR2008121804057.html?hpid=topnews |work=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A02 |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>

DeLauro was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].

;Abortion
DeLauro is pro-choice. She supports the availability of abortions in all cases. Additionally, representative DeLauro supports the use of federal subsidies for abortion procedures. In 2006 DeLauro voted against HR 6099, a bill that would require abortion providers to follow specific procedures and formalities before performing abortions. She also voted no in 2006 on a bill that makes the transportation of pregnant women under the age of 18 across state lines in order to obtain an abortion illegal.<ref name="Project Vote Smart">[http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=26788&type=category&category=2&go.x=11&go.y=14=], Issue Position: Abortion.</ref> DeLauro has faced criticism from the [[Roman Catholic Church]], of which she is a member, over her pro-choice position.  It is Catholic doctrine that [[abortion]] is a sin; however, as a representative of the U.S. government and not the Catholic Church, DeLauro, along with many other Catholics in the U.S. Government, has voted in favor of measures that support the availability of safe and legal abortion services.

;Gun issues
She has consistently voted in support of stronger regulation of firearms in the United States. In 2006 she voted against the Trigger Lock Amendment that ends the use of funds from the Commerce Department FY2007 Appropriation bill to enforce laws requiring guns to be sold with locks.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8996&can_id=26788], Key Vote: Trigger Lock Amendment.</ref> Additionally, DeLauro voted in 1999 to increase the amount of time given to perform background checks from 24 hours to 72 hours.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8861&can_id=26788], Key Vote: 72 Hour Background Check Amendment.</ref> Earlier, in 1998 she voted to increase the minimum gun crime sentence.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8175&can_id=26788], Key Vote: 72 Hour Background Check Amendment.</ref>  On 14 January 2013, she introduced a bill allowing for the voluntary surrender of assault-type weapons with compensation to come in the form of tax credits.<ref name="H.R. 226">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr226ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr226ih.pdf</ref>

;Campaign finance and government reform issues
In June 2010 representative DeLauro voted in favor of a bill for new disclosure requirements for political advertising. She voted against the 527 Reform Act of 2005, an act that put an end to party spending limits for candidates during general elections and again against the 527 Reform Act of 2006. DeLauro also helped to pass the Lobbying and Donation Regulations bill that put in place new regulations about lobbyists and donations for Congress members.

In 2002 DeLauro voted for the Help America Vote Act of 2002. This act provided, from Federal funds, $3.9 billion to modernize technology and create new programs to reach a higher standard and to make voting an easier process for disabled citizens, military personnel, citizens living abroad, and first-time voters without valid identification. Once again in 2006 representative DeLauro voted to simplify the voting process by casting her vote against the Federal Election Integrity Act of 2006 that required voters to show a government-issued photo identification before voting.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=26788#20697], Issue Position: Campaign Finance and Government Reform.</ref>

;Sponsored bills
DeLauro recently sponsored the Birth Defects Prevention, Risk Reduction, and Awareness Act of 2010 (H.R. 5462). This bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a birth defects prevention, risk reduction, and awareness program that will cost Americans less than one dollar from 2011 to 2015. The program will increase awareness about pregnancy and breastfeeding by starting a nationwide media campaign and provide grants for research on certain exposures that affect pregnancy and breastfed infants.  Most recently, on the fifteenth of November, 2010, this bill was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, labor, and Pensions.<ref name="Govtrack.us">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5462], Sponsored Bill.</ref>

;HR 875
DeLauro introduced HR 875,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-875 |title=Read The Bill: H.R. 875 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>  The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009. This legislation is aimed at reforming the food safety responsibilities handled by the FDA. The introduction of this bill represents a potential conflict of interest, because of her husband's, [[Stanley Greenberg]], current relation to agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbergresearch.com/index.php?ID=109 |title=Greenberg Quinlan Rosner &#124; Clients |publisher=Greenbergresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

;Hurricane Irene
In August 2011, the 3rd District suffered extreme damage when [[Hurricane Irene]] made landfall along the Connecticut coastline. Numerous homes were destroyed in [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctnow.com/weather/hc-irene-east-haven-0830-20110829,0,203340.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=Ctnow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> and other shore communities and the vast majority of Connecticut residents lost power for many days.<ref>{{cite web|author=EndPlay |url=http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/severe_weather/current-power-outages |title=It may be days before you have electricity &#124; Irene &#124; WTNH.com Connecticut |publisher=WTNH |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> At the time Hurricane Irene hit the state and during the immediate aftermath, DeLauro was vacationing along [[Italy]]'s [[Amalfi Coast]] and was not anticipated to return to the state until 5 days after the storm had passed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Obrian |first=Harry |url=http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2011/08/us-rep-rosa-delauro-monitoring.html |title=U.S. Rep.

;Healthcare
In July 2014, DeLauro introduced ''Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Act'', also known as the "SWEET Act", which would impose a 1 cent excise tax per teaspoon of caloric sweetener in soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweet teas (roughly 9 cents on a 12 oz. soda).<ref name=2014SWEETTax>{{cite news|last1=Harrington|first1=Elizabeth|title=Democrat Seeking National Soda Tax Revenue to go to Obamacare fund cut by Congress|url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/democrat-seeking-national-soda-tax/|accessdate=1 August 2014|agency=The Washington Free Beacon|date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> ‚ÄúThis act is intended to discourage excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by increasing the price of these products,‚Äù according to the text of the legislation. DeLauro and other supporters of the tax argue that it could help address the national epidemics of obesity and diabetes by discouraging consumers from consuming the products and also raise money to fund prevention and treatment programs and with research and dietary education to help reduce the costs of related health problems.<ref name=2014FoodSafety/>

The bill is opposed by the [[American Beverage Association]] and the [[National Automatic Merchandising Association]]<ref name=2014NAMAoppose>{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=NAMA Opposes Proposed National Tax On Sugar-Sweetened Beverages|url=http://www.vendingmarketwatch.com/news/11604851/nama-opposes-proposed-national-tax-on-sugar-sweetened-beverages|website=http://www.vendingmarketwatch.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> (NAMA) stating that "People don‚Äôt support taxes and bans on common grocery items, like soft drinks." and that sweetened beverages "are not the main source of added sugars for children and teens and that a tax on sugary drinks unfairly singles out the industry."<ref name=2014FoodSafety>{{cite web|last1=Zuraw|first1=Lydia|title=DeLauro Introduces Bill to Tax Sugar-Sweetened Beverages|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/07/delauro-introduces-bill-to-tax-sugar-sweetened-beverages-nationally/#.U9u9XWOTKr9|website=www.foodsafetynews.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

Rosa DeLauro is active on health policy issues, particularly women's health. She has introduced numerous bills aimed at improving cancer treatment and research and women's health policies.  As chair of the appropriations subcommittee that funds the Food and Drug Administration, she has been an outspoken critic of that agency's failures to protect the public from unsafe foods and medical products.

In May 2006, she was linked in press reports to U.S. Senator [[Christopher Dodd]]'s potential bid for President in 2008. On February 2, 2008, DeLauro endorsed Illinois Senator [[Barack Obama]] for [[President]] at her home in New Haven, Connecticut.<ref>[http://www.courant.com/news/politics/hc-delauro0202.artfeb02,0,6935512.story Rosa Will Back Obama - Courant.com]</ref>

On October 3, 2008, DeLauro voted a second time in the House in favor the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]] to help stabilize an economic crisis.<ref>[http://www.newstimes.com/danbury/ci_10601034?source=rss <!-- Bot generated title -->]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref> She worked to pass the [[Paycheck Fairness Act]]. She has urged politicians to be "big thinkers" on the issue of [[universal health care]].<ref>[http://www.middletownpress.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=18212465&BRD=1645&PAG=461&dept_id=571446&rfi=6 middletownpress.com]{{dead link|date=April 2011}}</ref>

The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported on December 17, 2008, that DeLauro was "a top contender" for the position of [[United States Secretary of Labor|Labor Secretary]] in the [[Obama administration]].<ref>[http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/12/17/shaiken-emerges-as-top-candidate-for-labor-secretary/ Shaiken Emerges as Top Candidate for Labor Secretary]</ref> However, President-elect Obama announced the nomination of fellow congresswoman [[Hilda Solis]] for the position on December 19.<ref>{{cite news |first=Anne E. |last=Kornblut |title=Obama to Announce Final Cabinet Picks |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/18/AR2008121804057.html?hpid=topnews |work=[[The Washington Post]] |page=A02 |date=2008-12-19 |accessdate=2009-01-25}}</ref>

DeLauro was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009 [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]].

;Abortion
DeLauro is pro-choice. She supports the availability of abortions in all cases. Additionally, representative DeLauro supports the use of federal subsidies for abortion procedures. In 2006 DeLauro voted against HR 6099, a bill that would require abortion providers to follow specific procedures and formalities before performing abortions. She also voted no in 2006 on a bill that makes the transportation of pregnant women under the age of 18 across state lines in order to obtain an abortion illegal.<ref name="Project Vote Smart">[http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=26788&type=category&category=2&go.x=11&go.y=14=], Issue Position: Abortion.</ref> DeLauro has faced criticism from the [[Roman Catholic Church]], of which she is a member, over her pro-choice position.  It is Catholic doctrine that [[abortion]] is a sin; however, as a representative of the U.S. government and not the Catholic Church, DeLauro, along with many other Catholics in the U.S. Government, has voted in favor of measures that support the availability of safe and legal abortion services.

;Gun issues
She has consistently voted in support of stronger regulation of firearms in the United States. In 2006 she voted against the Trigger Lock Amendment that ends the use of funds from the Commerce Department FY2007 Appropriation bill to enforce laws requiring guns to be sold with locks.<ref name=autogenerated4>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8996&can_id=26788], Key Vote: Trigger Lock Amendment.</ref> Additionally, DeLauro voted in 1999 to increase the amount of time given to perform background checks from 24 hours to 72 hours.<ref name=autogenerated2>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8861&can_id=26788], Key Vote: 72 Hour Background Check Amendment.</ref> Earlier, in 1998 she voted to increase the minimum gun crime sentence.<ref name=autogenerated3>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=8175&can_id=26788], Key Vote: 72 Hour Background Check Amendment.</ref>  On 14 January 2013, she introduced a bill allowing for the voluntary surrender of assault-type weapons with compensation to come in the form of tax credits.<ref name="H.R. 226">http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-113hr226ih/pdf/BILLS-113hr226ih.pdf</ref>

;Campaign finance and government reform issues
In June 2010 representative DeLauro voted in favor of a bill for new disclosure requirements for political advertising. She voted against the 527 Reform Act of 2005, an act that put an end to party spending limits for candidates during general elections and again against the 527 Reform Act of 2006. DeLauro also helped to pass the Lobbying and Donation Regulations bill that put in place new regulations about lobbyists and donations for Congress members.

In 2002 DeLauro voted for the Help America Vote Act of 2002. This act provided, from Federal funds, $3.9 billion to modernize technology and create new programs to reach a higher standard and to make voting an easier process for disabled citizens, military personnel, citizens living abroad, and first-time voters without valid identification. Once again in 2006 representative DeLauro voted to simplify the voting process by casting her vote against the Federal Election Integrity Act of 2006 that required voters to show a government-issued photo identification before voting.<ref name=autogenerated1>[http://www.votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=26788#20697], Issue Position: Campaign Finance and Government Reform.</ref>

;Sponsored bills
DeLauro recently sponsored the Birth Defects Prevention, Risk Reduction, and Awareness Act of 2010 (H.R. 5462). This bill allows the Secretary of Health and Human Services to create a birth defects prevention, risk reduction, and awareness program that will cost Americans less than one dollar from 2011 to 2015. The program will increase awareness about pregnancy and breastfeeding by starting a nationwide media campaign and provide grants for research on certain exposures that affect pregnancy and breastfed infants.  Most recently, on the fifteenth of November, 2010, this bill was received in the Senate and referred to the Committee on Health, Education, labor, and Pensions.<ref name="Govtrack.us">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5462], Sponsored Bill.</ref>

;HR 875
DeLauro introduced HR 875,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-875 |title=Read The Bill: H.R. 875 |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=2009-02-04 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>  The Food Safety Modernization Act of 2009. This legislation is aimed at reforming the food safety responsibilities handled by the FDA. The introduction of this bill represents a potential conflict of interest, because of her husband's, [[Stanley Greenberg]], current relation to agricultural biotechnology corporation Monsanto.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.greenbergresearch.com/index.php?ID=109 |title=Greenberg Quinlan Rosner &#124; Clients |publisher=Greenbergresearch.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

;Hurricane Irene
In August 2011, the 3rd District suffered extreme damage when [[Hurricane Irene]] made landfall along the Connecticut coastline. Numerous homes were destroyed in [[East Haven, Connecticut|East Haven]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ctnow.com/weather/hc-irene-east-haven-0830-20110829,0,203340.story |title=Topic Galleries |publisher=Ctnow.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> and other shore communities and the vast majority of Connecticut residents lost power for many days.<ref>{{cite web|author=EndPlay |url=http://www.wtnh.com/dpp/weather/severe_weather/current-power-outages |title=It may be days before you have electricity &#124; Irene &#124; WTNH.com Connecticut |publisher=WTNH |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> At the time Hurricane Irene hit the state and during the immediate aftermath, DeLauro was vacationing along [[Italy]]'s [[Amalfi Coast]] and was not anticipated to return to the state until 5 days after the storm had passed.<ref>{{cite web|last=Obrian |first=Harry |url=http://blogs.courant.com/capitol_watch/2011/08/us-rep-rosa-delauro-monitoring.html |title=U.S. Rep.

A ''[[Hartford Courant]]'' column rated DeLauro's storm response an "F".<ref>{{cite web|last=Green |first=Rick |url=http://blogs.courant.com/rick_green/2011/09/grading-public-officials-on-ir.html |title=Grading Public Officials On Irene - Rick Green &#124; CT Confidential |publisher=Blogs.courant.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref> Nonetheless, DeLauro told the [[New Haven Register]] she had "no apology for taking a vacation" and being out of state during the storm.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newhavenregister.com/articles/2011/09/03/news/doc4e6268f76850c051939353.txt?viewmode=2 |title=DeLauro tours storm-ravaged Connecticut district; defends her trip to Italy (video) |publisher=Newhavenregister.com |date= |accessdate=2013-08-25}}</ref>

;Healthcare
In July 2014, DeLauro introduced ''Sugar-Sweetened Beverages Tax Act'', also known as the "SWEET Act", which would impose a 1 cent excise tax per teaspoon of caloric sweetener in soda, energy drinks, sports drinks, and sweet teas (roughly 9 cents on a 12 oz. soda).<ref name=2014SWEETTax>{{cite news|last1=Harrington|first1=Elizabeth|title=Democrat Seeking National Soda Tax Revenue to go to Obamacare fund cut by Congress|url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/democrat-seeking-national-soda-tax/|accessdate=1 August 2014|agency=The Washington Free Beacon|date=August 1, 2014}}</ref> ‚ÄúThis act is intended to discourage excessive consumption of sugar-sweetened beverages by increasing the price of these products,‚Äù according to the text of the legislation. DeLauro and other supporters of the tax argue that it could help address the national epidemics of obesity and diabetes by discouraging consumers from consuming the products and also raise money to fund prevention and treatment programs and with research and dietary education to help reduce the costs of related health problems.<ref name=2014FoodSafety/>

The bill is opposed by the [[American Beverage Association]] and the [[National Automatic Merchandising Association]]<ref name=2014NAMAoppose>{{cite web|last1=Staff|title=NAMA Opposes Proposed National Tax On Sugar-Sweetened Beverages|url=http://www.vendingmarketwatch.com/news/11604851/nama-opposes-proposed-national-tax-on-sugar-sweetened-beverages|website=http://www.vendingmarketwatch.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref> (NAMA) stating that "People don‚Äôt support taxes and bans on common grocery items, like soft drinks." and that sweetened beverages "are not the main source of added sugars for children and teens and that a tax on sugary drinks unfairly singles out the industry."<ref name=2014FoodSafety>{{cite web|last1=Zuraw|first1=Lydia|title=DeLauro Introduces Bill to Tax Sugar-Sweetened Beverages|url=http://www.foodsafetynews.com/2014/07/delauro-introduces-bill-to-tax-sugar-sweetened-beverages-nationally/#.U9u9XWOTKr9|website=www.foodsafetynews.com|accessdate=1 August 2014}}</ref>

Several news services picked up the story, eventually leading DeLauro to admit that while she had visited the site, she disagreed with its premise.<ref>{{cite web|last=Keller |first=Jared |url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/features/view/feature/Rosa-DeLauro-and-Hipsters-974 |title=Rosa DeLauro and Hipsters |publisher=The Atlantic Wire |date=2010-03-30 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=8:11 EDT |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/politics/blogs/yeas-and-nays/Holy-hipster_-Rosa-DeLauro-stays-informed-of-hipster-status-97110634.html |title=Rosa DeLauro stays informed of hipster status |publisher=Washington Examiner |date=2010-06-24 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>
