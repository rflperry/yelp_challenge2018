'''Andrew P. “Andy” Harris''' (born January 25, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[physician]] who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|1}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and is currently the only Republican member of Maryland’s congressional delegation; he previously served in the [[Maryland Senate|Senate]] of the [[Maryland General Assembly]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Harris’s father was Zoltán Harris, an [[anesthesiologist]] who was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], in 1911 and emigrated to the United States in 1950; his mother, Irene, was born in [[Poland]].<ref name="harris bio" />

Harris earned his B.S. in biology (1977) and his M.D. (1980) from [[The Johns Hopkins University]]. The University’s Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred the M.H.S. in 1995 in Health Policy & Management and also Health Finance & Management.<ref name="harris bio">[http://andyharris08.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=26 Andy Harris for Congress: Biography]. Retrieved August 6, 2007.</ref>

Harris served in the [[Navy Medical Corps]] and the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a lieutenant commander on active duty during [[Operation Desert Storm]] and currently serves as a commander.<ref name="harris bio"/> He has worked as an anesthesiologist, as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.<ref name="harris bio"/>

==Maryland General Assembly==
Harris was first elected to the [[Maryland Senate]] in 1998 for District 9 for [[Baltimore County]].<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/gasse.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results]</ref>  He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader [[F. Vernon Boozer]], in the 1998 primary election.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/passe.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results (primary)]</ref>  A major factor in the race was Boozer’s role in derailing an attempt to ban [[partial-birth abortion]] a year earlier; the bill’s sponsor, fellow state senator [[Larry E. Haines|Larry Haines]], supported Harris’s primary bid.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/mdleg/abortion031199.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Washingtonpost.com: 'Partial Birth' Ban Set to Pass in Md | date=March 11, 1999}}</ref> In the general election he defeated Democrat challenger Anthony O. Blades.

His district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing Baltimore County and [[Harford County, Md.|Harford County]]. He defeated Democratic challenger Diane DeCarlo in the general election in 2002,<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2002/results/g_state_senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2002 election results]</ref> and from 2003 to 2006 served as the [[minority whip]].<ref name="harris bio"/> In 2006 he won re-election, this time defeating Patricia A. Foerster.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2006/results/general/office_State_Senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2006 election results]</ref>

==U.S. congressional campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008#1st Congressional District}}
Harris defeated incumbent Republican [[Wayne Gilchrest]] and State Senator [[E.J. Pipkin]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006|Republican primary]] for [[Maryland's 1st congressional district]].<ref name="2008 results"/> Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, one of the leading moderate Republicans in the House. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrest’s decision to support a Democratic bill setting a timetable for [[troop withdrawal from Iraq]] and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]],<ref>[http://andyharris08.org/news/club-for-growth-endorses-andy-harris.html Club for Growth Endorses Andy Harris] ''Andy Harris For Congress'' Press Release.

The November election was expected to be very close, even though the 1st is considered to be very Republican on paper. This was partly due to the district’s geography.  Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], which is home to half the district’s population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting [[absentee ballot]]s, Kratovil’s lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html|title=AP: Kratovil Winner Of 1st District Seat|publisher=WJZ-TV|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081113215948/http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html| archivedate= November 13, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHMD/H/01|title=Maryland's 1st District |publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/| archivedate= November 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Harris finally conceded on November 11.  While Harris won the Baltimore suburbs handily, it was not enough to overcome his deficit on the Eastern Shore. [[John McCain]] won this district by 19 points, his best showing in the state.

===2010===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#1st Congressional District*}}
Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.

Harris’s primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November 2 general election]], the district reverted to form, and Harris defeated Kratovil by 14 percent.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2012#District 1}}

The [[National Journal]]’s [[Cook Political Report]] named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could [[Redistricting|redraw]] Harris’s home in Cockeysville out of the 1st.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting |author= David Wasserman and Julia Edwards|date= April 15, 2011|work= Cook Political Report|publisher= National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501045824/http://nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415| archivedate= May 1, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Instead, [[Roscoe Bartlett]]'s district was redrawn so as to beat him.<ref>John Fritze, "Delaney Defeats Bartlett in the 6th District", ''Baltimore Sun'', November 7, 2012.</ref> Harris was a beneficiary of this remap, as the reconfigured 1st included several heavily Republican portions of Harford and Baltimore counties that had previously been in Bartlett’s 6th district.

Harris skated to a second term, defeating Democratic challenger Wendy Rosen with 67 percent of the vote. Rosen had withdrawn from the race after being confronted with information about election-law violations. By the time she pulled out, however, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosen’s replacement, but could only be a write-in.

==Controversies==

===Affordable Care Act===
Harris’s prominence as a medical doctor in opposition to government-run health care made him a lightning rod for attacks by supporters of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care legislation]]. At a closed-door employee benefits briefing for new congressmen during the November 2010 freshman orientation, Harris was surprised to learn that the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal employee health benefit plan]] would leave the new congressmen and their staffers without coverage until the following pay period, 28 days after inauguration. Concerned about this gap in coverage, he asked whether new government employees could purchase temporary coverage to fill this gap. “This is the only employer I’ve ever worked for where you don’t get coverage the first day you are employed,” he said through his spokeswoman, Anna Nix.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/republican-rep-elect-refutes-claim-lost-congressional-health-care-rules/ | work=Fox News | title=Republican Rep.-Elect Refutes Claim He Lost It Over Congressional Health Care Rules | date=November 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20022969-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Stephanie | last=Condon | title=House GOP Freshman Demands Gov't Health Care | date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Through a spokesman, his defeated opponent, Frank Kratovil, seized upon this dialogue, characterizing the question as a “demand” for special treatment and for access to the benefits he opposed in the new law.<ref>Paul West, "[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-harris-health-care-20101116,0,4762295.story Rep.-elect Harris snagged in health care flap]," ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Nov. 16, 2010.</ref> Furthermore, “Harris then asked if he could purchase insurance from the government to cover the gap,” added an aide, who was struck by the similarity to Harris’s request and the public option he denounced as a gateway to [[socialized medicine]].<ref>Glen Thrush, "[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45181.html GOP frosh: Where's my health care?]" ''[[Politico]]'', Nov. 15, 2010.</ref>

===Debt ceiling===
On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.<ref>Washington Post, October 16/17, 2013.  "Votes to end the government shutdown".</ref>

===DC cannabis reform===
In 2014 Harris led the charge to block a recently adopted [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States#District of Columbia|Washington D.C. cannabis decriminalization]] bill.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Harris’s Reefer Madness: Amendment To Block DC Decrim Could Do The Opposite|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/25/andy-harriss-reefer-madness-amendment-to-block-dc-decrim-could-do-the-opposite/|publisher=The Daily Caller}}</ref> His amendment led to a call from D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray to boycott tourism to Rep. Harris's district and the [[boycott of Maryland's 1st District]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=DeBonis|first1=Mike|title=D.C. residents urged to boycott Md. shore to protest congressman’s marijuana move|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-residents-urged-to-boycott-md-shore-to-protest-congressmans-marijuana-move/2014/07/02/59941a2e-0219-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=Washington Post|date=2 July 2014}}</ref> as well as an online campaign requesting that D.C. area businesses refuse him service at their establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blacklist Andy Harris - A District of Columbia Protest|url=http://blacklistandyharris.tumblr.com/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> In November 2014, D.C. residents overwhelmingly voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis for adults with 68% in favor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|title=Washington, D.C.

Harris noted that "the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate oversight about what happens in the federal district."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Ed|title=Congressional spending deal blocks pot legalization in D.C.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congressional-budget-deal-may-upend-marijuana-legalization-in-dc/2014/12/09/6dff94f6-7f2e-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> Harris believes that cannabis is a [[gateway drug]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raju|first1=Manu|last2=Topaz|first2=Jonathan|title=D.C. pot fight puts GOP in an awkward spot  Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dc-marijuana-republicans-113489.html#ixzz3LbFimzDH|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dc-marijuana-republicans-113489.html|website=politico.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> and has no proven medicinal use.<ref>http://harris.house.gov/video/rep-harris-debates-medical-marijuana-house-floor-52914</ref>

Shortly after his success in blocking the District voters' will, several media outlets revealed a serious conflict of interest involved in his stance on marijuana reform. It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, "a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis," which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but  it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.<ref>http://www.attn.com/stories/463/one-congressman-just-ruined-legalized-marijuana-dc-everyone-heres-why</ref>

'''Andrew P. “Andy” Harris''' (born January 25, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[physician]] who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|1}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and is currently the only Republican member of Maryland’s congressional delegation; he previously served in the [[Maryland Senate|Senate]] of the [[Maryland General Assembly]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Harris’s father was Zoltán Harris, an [[anesthesiologist]] who was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], in 1911 and emigrated to the United States in 1950; his mother, Irene, was born in [[Poland]].<ref name="harris bio" />

Harris earned his B.S. in biology (1977) and his M.D. (1980) from [[The Johns Hopkins University]]. The University’s Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred the M.H.S. in 1995 in Health Policy & Management and also Health Finance & Management.<ref name="harris bio">[http://andyharris08.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=26 Andy Harris for Congress: Biography]. Retrieved August 6, 2007.</ref>

Harris served in the [[Navy Medical Corps]] and the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a lieutenant commander on active duty during [[Operation Desert Storm]] and currently serves as a commander.<ref name="harris bio"/> He has worked as an anesthesiologist, as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.<ref name="harris bio"/>

==Maryland General Assembly==
Harris was first elected to the [[Maryland Senate]] in 1998 for District 9 for [[Baltimore County]].<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/gasse.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results]</ref>  He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader [[F. Vernon Boozer]], in the 1998 primary election.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/passe.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results (primary)]</ref>  A major factor in the race was Boozer’s role in derailing an attempt to ban [[partial-birth abortion]] a year earlier; the bill’s sponsor, fellow state senator [[Larry E. Haines|Larry Haines]], supported Harris’s primary bid.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/mdleg/abortion031199.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Washingtonpost.com: 'Partial Birth' Ban Set to Pass in Md | date=March 11, 1999}}</ref> In the general election he defeated Democrat challenger Anthony O. Blades.

His district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing Baltimore County and [[Harford County, Md.|Harford County]]. He defeated Democratic challenger Diane DeCarlo in the general election in 2002,<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2002/results/g_state_senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2002 election results]</ref> and from 2003 to 2006 served as the [[minority whip]].<ref name="harris bio"/> In 2006 he won re-election, this time defeating Patricia A. Foerster.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2006/results/general/office_State_Senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2006 election results]</ref>

==U.S. congressional campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008#1st Congressional District}}
Harris defeated incumbent Republican [[Wayne Gilchrest]] and State Senator [[E.J. Pipkin]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006|Republican primary]] for [[Maryland's 1st congressional district]].<ref name="2008 results"/> Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, one of the leading moderate Republicans in the House. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrest’s decision to support a Democratic bill setting a timetable for [[troop withdrawal from Iraq]] and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]],<ref>[http://andyharris08.org/news/club-for-growth-endorses-andy-harris.html Club for Growth Endorses Andy Harris] ''Andy Harris For Congress'' Press Release.

The November election was expected to be very close, even though the 1st is considered to be very Republican on paper. This was partly due to the district’s geography.  Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], which is home to half the district’s population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting [[absentee ballot]]s, Kratovil’s lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html|title=AP: Kratovil Winner Of 1st District Seat|publisher=WJZ-TV|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081113215948/http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html| archivedate= November 13, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHMD/H/01|title=Maryland's 1st District |publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/| archivedate= November 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Harris finally conceded on November 11.  While Harris won the Baltimore suburbs handily, it was not enough to overcome his deficit on the Eastern Shore. [[John McCain]] won this district by 19 points, his best showing in the state.

===2010===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#1st Congressional District*}}
Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.

Harris’s primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November 2 general election]], the district reverted to form, and Harris defeated Kratovil by 14 percent.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2012#District 1}}

The [[National Journal]]’s [[Cook Political Report]] named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could [[Redistricting|redraw]] Harris’s home in Cockeysville out of the 1st.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting |author= David Wasserman and Julia Edwards|date= April 15, 2011|work= Cook Political Report|publisher= National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501045824/http://nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415| archivedate= May 1, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Instead, [[Roscoe Bartlett]]'s district was redrawn so as to beat him.<ref>John Fritze, "Delaney Defeats Bartlett in the 6th District", ''Baltimore Sun'', November 7, 2012.</ref> Harris was a beneficiary of this remap, as the reconfigured 1st included several heavily Republican portions of Harford and Baltimore counties that had previously been in Bartlett’s 6th district.

Harris skated to a second term, defeating Democratic challenger Wendy Rosen with 67 percent of the vote. Rosen had withdrawn from the race after being confronted with information about election-law violations. By the time she pulled out, however, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosen’s replacement, but could only be a write-in.

==Controversies==

===Affordable Care Act===
Harris’s prominence as a medical doctor in opposition to government-run health care made him a lightning rod for attacks by supporters of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care legislation]]. At a closed-door employee benefits briefing for new congressmen during the November 2010 freshman orientation, Harris was surprised to learn that the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal employee health benefit plan]] would leave the new congressmen and their staffers without coverage until the following pay period, 28 days after inauguration. Concerned about this gap in coverage, he asked whether new government employees could purchase temporary coverage to fill this gap. “This is the only employer I’ve ever worked for where you don’t get coverage the first day you are employed,” he said through his spokeswoman, Anna Nix.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/republican-rep-elect-refutes-claim-lost-congressional-health-care-rules/ | work=Fox News | title=Republican Rep.-Elect Refutes Claim He Lost It Over Congressional Health Care Rules | date=November 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20022969-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Stephanie | last=Condon | title=House GOP Freshman Demands Gov't Health Care | date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Through a spokesman, his defeated opponent, Frank Kratovil, seized upon this dialogue, characterizing the question as a “demand” for special treatment and for access to the benefits he opposed in the new law.<ref>Paul West, "[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-harris-health-care-20101116,0,4762295.story Rep.-elect Harris snagged in health care flap]," ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Nov. 16, 2010.</ref> Furthermore, “Harris then asked if he could purchase insurance from the government to cover the gap,” added an aide, who was struck by the similarity to Harris’s request and the public option he denounced as a gateway to [[socialized medicine]].<ref>Glen Thrush, "[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45181.html GOP frosh: Where's my health care?]" ''[[Politico]]'', Nov. 15, 2010.</ref>

===Debt ceiling===
On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.<ref>Washington Post, October 16/17, 2013.  "Votes to end the government shutdown".</ref>

===DC cannabis reform===
In 2014 Harris led the charge to block a recently adopted [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States#District of Columbia|Washington D.C. cannabis decriminalization]] bill.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Harris’s Reefer Madness: Amendment To Block DC Decrim Could Do The Opposite|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/25/andy-harriss-reefer-madness-amendment-to-block-dc-decrim-could-do-the-opposite/|publisher=The Daily Caller}}</ref> His amendment led to a call from D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray to boycott tourism to Rep. Harris's district and the [[boycott of Maryland's 1st District]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=DeBonis|first1=Mike|title=D.C. residents urged to boycott Md. shore to protest congressman’s marijuana move|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-residents-urged-to-boycott-md-shore-to-protest-congressmans-marijuana-move/2014/07/02/59941a2e-0219-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=Washington Post|date=2 July 2014}}</ref> as well as an online campaign requesting that D.C. area businesses refuse him service at their establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blacklist Andy Harris - A District of Columbia Protest|url=http://blacklistandyharris.tumblr.com/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> In November 2014, D.C. residents overwhelmingly voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis for adults with 68% in favor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|title=Washington, D.C.

Harris noted that "the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate oversight about what happens in the federal district."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Ed|title=Congressional spending deal blocks pot legalization in D.C.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congressional-budget-deal-may-upend-marijuana-legalization-in-dc/2014/12/09/6dff94f6-7f2e-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> Harris believes that cannabis is a [[gateway drug]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raju|first1=Manu|last2=Topaz|first2=Jonathan|title=D.C. pot fight puts GOP in an awkward spot  Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dc-marijuana-republicans-113489.html#ixzz3LbFimzDH|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dc-marijuana-republicans-113489.html|website=politico.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> and has no proven medicinal use.<ref>http://harris.house.gov/video/rep-harris-debates-medical-marijuana-house-floor-52914</ref>

Shortly after his success in blocking the District voters' will, several media outlets revealed a serious conflict of interest involved in his stance on marijuana reform. It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, "a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis," which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but  it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.<ref>http://www.attn.com/stories/463/one-congressman-just-ruined-legalized-marijuana-dc-everyone-heres-why</ref>

'''Andrew P. “Andy” Harris''' (born January 25, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[physician]] who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|1}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and is currently the only Republican member of Maryland’s congressional delegation; he previously served in the [[Maryland Senate|Senate]] of the [[Maryland General Assembly]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Harris’s father was Zoltán Harris, an [[anesthesiologist]] who was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], in 1911 and emigrated to the United States in 1950; his mother, Irene, was born in [[Poland]].<ref name="harris bio" />

Harris earned his B.S. in biology (1977) and his M.D. (1980) from [[The Johns Hopkins University]]. The University’s Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred the M.H.S. in 1995 in Health Policy & Management and also Health Finance & Management.<ref name="harris bio">[http://andyharris08.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=26 Andy Harris for Congress: Biography]. Retrieved August 6, 2007.</ref>

Harris served in the [[Navy Medical Corps]] and the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a lieutenant commander on active duty during [[Operation Desert Storm]] and currently serves as a commander.<ref name="harris bio"/> He has worked as an anesthesiologist, as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.<ref name="harris bio"/>

==Maryland General Assembly==
Harris was first elected to the [[Maryland Senate]] in 1998 for District 9 for [[Baltimore County]].<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/gasse.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results]</ref>  He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader [[F. Vernon Boozer]], in the 1998 primary election.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/passe.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results (primary)]</ref>  A major factor in the race was Boozer’s role in derailing an attempt to ban [[partial-birth abortion]] a year earlier; the bill’s sponsor, fellow state senator [[Larry E. Haines|Larry Haines]], supported Harris’s primary bid.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/mdleg/abortion031199.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Washingtonpost.com: 'Partial Birth' Ban Set to Pass in Md | date=March 11, 1999}}</ref> In the general election he defeated Democrat challenger Anthony O. Blades.

His district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing Baltimore County and [[Harford County, Md.|Harford County]]. He defeated Democratic challenger Diane DeCarlo in the general election in 2002,<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2002/results/g_state_senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2002 election results]</ref> and from 2003 to 2006 served as the [[minority whip]].<ref name="harris bio"/> In 2006 he won re-election, this time defeating Patricia A. Foerster.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2006/results/general/office_State_Senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2006 election results]</ref>

==U.S. congressional campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008#1st Congressional District}}
Harris defeated incumbent Republican [[Wayne Gilchrest]] and State Senator [[E.J. Pipkin]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006|Republican primary]] for [[Maryland's 1st congressional district]].<ref name="2008 results"/> Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, one of the leading moderate Republicans in the House. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrest’s decision to support a Democratic bill setting a timetable for [[troop withdrawal from Iraq]] and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]],<ref>[http://andyharris08.org/news/club-for-growth-endorses-andy-harris.html Club for Growth Endorses Andy Harris] ''Andy Harris For Congress'' Press Release.

The November election was expected to be very close, even though the 1st is considered to be very Republican on paper. This was partly due to the district’s geography.  Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], which is home to half the district’s population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting [[absentee ballot]]s, Kratovil’s lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html|title=AP: Kratovil Winner Of 1st District Seat|publisher=WJZ-TV|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081113215948/http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html| archivedate= November 13, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHMD/H/01|title=Maryland's 1st District |publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/| archivedate= November 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Harris finally conceded on November 11.  While Harris won the Baltimore suburbs handily, it was not enough to overcome his deficit on the Eastern Shore. [[John McCain]] won this district by 19 points, his best showing in the state.

===2010===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#1st Congressional District*}}
Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.

Harris’s primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November 2 general election]], the district reverted to form, and Harris defeated Kratovil by 14 percent.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2012#District 1}}

The [[National Journal]]’s [[Cook Political Report]] named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could [[Redistricting|redraw]] Harris’s home in Cockeysville out of the 1st.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting |author= David Wasserman and Julia Edwards|date= April 15, 2011|work= Cook Political Report|publisher= National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501045824/http://nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415| archivedate= May 1, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Instead, [[Roscoe Bartlett]]'s district was redrawn so as to beat him.<ref>John Fritze, "Delaney Defeats Bartlett in the 6th District", ''Baltimore Sun'', November 7, 2012.</ref> Harris was a beneficiary of this remap, as the reconfigured 1st included several heavily Republican portions of Harford and Baltimore counties that had previously been in Bartlett’s 6th district.

Harris skated to a second term, defeating Democratic challenger Wendy Rosen with 67 percent of the vote. Rosen had withdrawn from the race after being confronted with information about election-law violations. By the time she pulled out, however, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosen’s replacement, but could only be a write-in.

==Controversies==

===Affordable Care Act===
Harris’s prominence as a medical doctor in opposition to government-run health care made him a lightning rod for attacks by supporters of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care legislation]]. At a closed-door employee benefits briefing for new congressmen during the November 2010 freshman orientation, Harris was surprised to learn that the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal employee health benefit plan]] would leave the new congressmen and their staffers without coverage until the following pay period, 28 days after inauguration. Concerned about this gap in coverage, he asked whether new government employees could purchase temporary coverage to fill this gap. “This is the only employer I’ve ever worked for where you don’t get coverage the first day you are employed,” he said through his spokeswoman, Anna Nix.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/republican-rep-elect-refutes-claim-lost-congressional-health-care-rules/ | work=Fox News | title=Republican Rep.-Elect Refutes Claim He Lost It Over Congressional Health Care Rules | date=November 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20022969-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Stephanie | last=Condon | title=House GOP Freshman Demands Gov't Health Care | date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Through a spokesman, his defeated opponent, Frank Kratovil, seized upon this dialogue, characterizing the question as a “demand” for special treatment and for access to the benefits he opposed in the new law.<ref>Paul West, "[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-harris-health-care-20101116,0,4762295.story Rep.-elect Harris snagged in health care flap]," ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Nov. 16, 2010.</ref> Furthermore, “Harris then asked if he could purchase insurance from the government to cover the gap,” added an aide, who was struck by the similarity to Harris’s request and the public option he denounced as a gateway to [[socialized medicine]].<ref>Glen Thrush, "[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45181.html GOP frosh: Where's my health care?]" ''[[Politico]]'', Nov. 15, 2010.</ref>

===Debt ceiling===
On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.<ref>Washington Post, October 16/17, 2013.  "Votes to end the government shutdown".</ref>

===DC cannabis reform===
In 2014 Harris led the charge to block a recently adopted [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States#District of Columbia|Washington D.C. cannabis decriminalization]] bill.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Harris’s Reefer Madness: Amendment To Block DC Decrim Could Do The Opposite|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/25/andy-harriss-reefer-madness-amendment-to-block-dc-decrim-could-do-the-opposite/|publisher=The Daily Caller}}</ref> His amendment led to a call from D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray to boycott tourism to Rep.

Shortly after his success in blocking the District voters' will, several media outlets revealed a serious conflict of interest involved in his stance on marijuana reform. It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, "a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis," which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but  it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.<ref>http://www.attn.com/stories/463/one-congressman-just-ruined-legalized-marijuana-dc-everyone-heres-why</ref>

'''Andrew P. “Andy” Harris''' (born January 25, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[physician]] who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|1}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and is currently the only Republican member of Maryland’s congressional delegation; he previously served in the [[Maryland Senate|Senate]] of the [[Maryland General Assembly]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Harris’s father was Zoltán Harris, an [[anesthesiologist]] who was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], in 1911 and emigrated to the United States in 1950; his mother, Irene, was born in [[Poland]].<ref name="harris bio" />

Harris earned his B.S. in biology (1977) and his M.D. (1980) from [[The Johns Hopkins University]]. The University’s Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred the M.H.S. in 1995 in Health Policy & Management and also Health Finance & Management.<ref name="harris bio">[http://andyharris08.org/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=13&Itemid=26 Andy Harris for Congress: Biography]. Retrieved August 6, 2007.</ref>

Harris served in the [[Navy Medical Corps]] and the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a lieutenant commander on active duty during [[Operation Desert Storm]] and currently serves as a commander.<ref name="harris bio"/> He has worked as an anesthesiologist, as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.<ref name="harris bio"/>

==Maryland General Assembly==
Harris was first elected to the [[Maryland Senate]] in 1998 for District 9 for [[Baltimore County]].<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/gasse.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results]</ref>  He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader [[F. Vernon Boozer]], in the 1998 primary election.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/passe.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 1998 election results (primary)]</ref>  A major factor in the race was Boozer’s role in derailing an attempt to ban [[partial-birth abortion]] a year earlier; the bill’s sponsor, fellow state senator [[Larry E. Haines|Larry Haines]], supported Harris’s primary bid.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/local/longterm/mdleg/abortion031199.htm | work=The Washington Post | title=Washingtonpost.com: 'Partial Birth' Ban Set to Pass in Md | date=March 11, 1999}}</ref> In the general election he defeated Democrat challenger Anthony O. Blades.

His district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing Baltimore County and [[Harford County, Md.|Harford County]]. He defeated Democratic challenger Diane DeCarlo in the general election in 2002,<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2002/results/g_state_senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2002 election results]</ref> and from 2003 to 2006 served as the [[minority whip]].<ref name="harris bio"/> In 2006 he won re-election, this time defeating Patricia A. Foerster.<ref>[http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/2006/results/general/office_State_Senator.html Maryland State Board of Elections - 2006 election results]</ref>

==U.S. congressional campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2008#1st Congressional District}}
Harris defeated incumbent Republican [[Wayne Gilchrest]] and State Senator [[E.J. Pipkin]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006|Republican primary]] for [[Maryland's 1st congressional district]].<ref name="2008 results"/> Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, one of the leading moderate Republicans in the House. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrest’s decision to support a Democratic bill setting a timetable for [[troop withdrawal from Iraq]] and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]],<ref>[http://andyharris08.org/news/club-for-growth-endorses-andy-harris.html Club for Growth Endorses Andy Harris] ''Andy Harris For Congress'' Press Release. August 13, 2007. Retrieved August 17, 2007.</ref> which raised nearly $250,000 for him,<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/races/contrib.php?cycle=2008&id=MD01 OpenSecrets.org].

The November election was expected to be very close, even though the 1st is considered to be very Republican on paper. This was partly due to the district’s geography.  Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], which is home to half the district’s population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting [[absentee ballot]]s, Kratovil’s lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html|title=AP: Kratovil Winner Of 1st District Seat|publisher=WJZ-TV|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081113215948/http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html| archivedate= November 13, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHMD/H/01|title=Maryland's 1st District |publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2008| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/| archivedate= November 7, 2008 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> Harris finally conceded on November 11.  While Harris won the Baltimore suburbs handily, it was not enough to overcome his deficit on the Eastern Shore. [[John McCain]] won this district by 19 points, his best showing in the state.

===2010===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#1st Congressional District*}}
Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.

Harris’s primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November 2 general election]], the district reverted to form, and Harris defeated Kratovil by 14 percent.

The [[National Journal]]’s [[Cook Political Report]] named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could [[Redistricting|redraw]] Harris’s home in Cockeysville out of the 1st.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting |author= David Wasserman and Julia Edwards|date= April 15, 2011|work= Cook Political Report|publisher= National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011| archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20110501045824/http://nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415| archivedate= May 1, 2011 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  Instead, [[Roscoe Bartlett]]'s district was redrawn so as to beat him.<ref>John Fritze, "Delaney Defeats Bartlett in the 6th District", ''Baltimore Sun'', November 7, 2012.</ref> Harris was a beneficiary of this remap, as the reconfigured 1st included several heavily Republican portions of Harford and Baltimore counties that had previously been in Bartlett’s 6th district.

Harris skated to a second term, defeating Democratic challenger Wendy Rosen with 67 percent of the vote. Rosen had withdrawn from the race after being confronted with information about election-law violations. By the time she pulled out, however, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosen’s replacement, but could only be a write-in.

==Controversies==

===Affordable Care Act===
Harris’s prominence as a medical doctor in opposition to government-run health care made him a lightning rod for attacks by supporters of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care legislation]]. At a closed-door employee benefits briefing for new congressmen during the November 2010 freshman orientation, Harris was surprised to learn that the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal employee health benefit plan]] would leave the new congressmen and their staffers without coverage until the following pay period, 28 days after inauguration. Concerned about this gap in coverage, he asked whether new government employees could purchase temporary coverage to fill this gap. “This is the only employer I’ve ever worked for where you don’t get coverage the first day you are employed,” he said through his spokeswoman, Anna Nix.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/republican-rep-elect-refutes-claim-lost-congressional-health-care-rules/ | work=Fox News | title=Republican Rep.-Elect Refutes Claim He Lost It Over Congressional Health Care Rules | date=November 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20022969-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Stephanie | last=Condon | title=House GOP Freshman Demands Gov't Health Care | date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Through a spokesman, his defeated opponent, Frank Kratovil, seized upon this dialogue, characterizing the question as a “demand” for special treatment and for access to the benefits he opposed in the new law.<ref>Paul West, "[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-harris-health-care-20101116,0,4762295.story Rep.-elect Harris snagged in health care flap]," ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Nov. 16, 2010.</ref> Furthermore, “Harris then asked if he could purchase insurance from the government to cover the gap,” added an aide, who was struck by the similarity to Harris’s request and the public option he denounced as a gateway to [[socialized medicine]].<ref>Glen Thrush, "[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45181.html GOP frosh: Where's my health care?]" ''[[Politico]]'', Nov. 15, 2010.</ref>

===Debt ceiling===
On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.<ref>Washington Post, October 16/17, 2013.  "Votes to end the government shutdown".</ref>

===DC cannabis reform===
In 2014 Harris led the charge to block a recently adopted [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States#District of Columbia|Washington D.C. cannabis decriminalization]] bill.<ref>{{cite web|title=Andy Harris’s Reefer Madness: Amendment To Block DC Decrim Could Do The Opposite|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/06/25/andy-harriss-reefer-madness-amendment-to-block-dc-decrim-could-do-the-opposite/|publisher=The Daily Caller}}</ref> His amendment led to a call from D.C. Mayor Vincent Gray to boycott tourism to Rep. Harris's district and the [[boycott of Maryland's 1st District]],<ref>{{cite news|last1=DeBonis|first1=Mike|title=D.C. residents urged to boycott Md. shore to protest congressman’s marijuana move|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/dc-residents-urged-to-boycott-md-shore-to-protest-congressmans-marijuana-move/2014/07/02/59941a2e-0219-11e4-b8ff-89afd3fad6bd_story.html|accessdate=14 July 2014|work=Washington Post|date=2 July 2014}}</ref> as well as an online campaign requesting that D.C. area businesses refuse him service at their establishments.<ref>{{cite web|title=Blacklist Andy Harris - A District of Columbia Protest|url=http://blacklistandyharris.tumblr.com/|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> In November 2014, D.C. residents overwhelmingly voted in favor of legalizing recreational cannabis for adults with 68% in favor.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ferner|first1=Matt|title=Washington, D.C.

Harris noted that "the Constitution gives Congress the ultimate oversight about what happens in the federal district."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Ed|title=Congressional spending deal blocks pot legalization in D.C.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congressional-budget-deal-may-upend-marijuana-legalization-in-dc/2014/12/09/6dff94f6-7f2e-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=10 December 2014}}</ref> Harris believes that cannabis is a [[gateway drug]]<ref>{{cite web|last1=Raju|first1=Manu|last2=Topaz|first2=Jonathan|title=D.C. pot fight puts GOP in an awkward spot  Read more: http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dc-marijuana-republicans-113489.html#ixzz3LbFimzDH|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/12/dc-marijuana-republicans-113489.html|website=politico.com|accessdate=11 December 2014}}</ref> and has no proven medicinal use.<ref>http://harris.house.gov/video/rep-harris-debates-medical-marijuana-house-floor-52914</ref>

Shortly after his success in blocking the District voters' will, several media outlets revealed a serious conflict of interest involved in his stance on marijuana reform. It came to light that Harris' third largest campaign donor is the pharmaceutical corporation Emergent BioSolutions, based in Rockville, Maryland. One of Emergent's products is epsil, "a fast-acting treatment that reduces the pain associated with oral mucositis," which is a common complication of chemotherapy from cancer treatment. Marijuana has been recognized formally in a number of states as having immense therapeutic potential for cancer patients. In fact, in states where medical marijuana has legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly. The congressman has not explicitly addressed this issue, but  it is now clear Harris has not disclosed an important conflict of interest surrounding his recent activity against marijuana reform.<ref>http://www.attn.com/stories/463/one-congressman-just-ruined-legalized-marijuana-dc-everyone-heres-why</ref>
