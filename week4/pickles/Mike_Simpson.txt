==Early life, education and career==
Born in [[Burley, Idaho|Burley]], Simpson was raised in [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]], where his father was a [[dentist]].

Simpson was the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Idaho House of Representatives|Idaho House]] prior to his election to Congress.

While some members of Congress with a medical background prefer to be addressed as "Doctor" (most notably former [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20181.html|title=Honorable? Former lawmakers mull title - Daniel Libit |publisher=Politico.Com|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson does not insist that he be referred to as Dr. Simpson, preferring to simply go by Congressman or Mr. Simpson.

In the [[111th United States Congress]] Simpson became the [[Ranking Member]] on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Upon assuming this position, and the subsequent chairmanship of the subcommittee, Mr. Simpson is considered a "Cardinal" (a term applied to the chairmen or ranking members of the Appropriations Subcommittees) within the House Republican Caucus. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee.<ref name="thehill1">{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/11/25/simpson-replaces-young-on-gop-steering-committee |title=Blog Briefing Room - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Briefingroom.thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Known as the "committee of committees", the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/11/25/simpson-replaces-young-on-gop-steering-committee/ |title=Blog Briefing Room - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Briefingroom.thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson replaced Congressman [[Don Young]] (R-AK) on the committee.<ref name="thehill1"/>

==Legislation==
On March 21, 2014, Simpson introduced the bill [[To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to maintain or replace certain facilities and structures for commercial recreation services at Smith Gulch in Idaho (H.R. 4283; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4238allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4238 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4283/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] to permit private entities to repair or replace certain commercial facilities on [[United States Forest Service]] land in [[Idaho]].<ref name=cbo4283>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4283|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45517|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "this legislation clarifies Congress' intent of the 2004 amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which continued the existing use and occupancy of commercial services in this corridor of the Salmon River."<ref name=SimpsonPR>{{cite web|title=Simpson Bill to Authorize Facilities Maintenance on Salmon River Passes House|url=http://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=392777|publisher=House Office of Rep. Mike Simpson|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=8 September 2014}}</ref>

On June 20, 2014, Simpson introduced the [[Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4923; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would make [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015.<ref name=4923sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4923 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4923|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is only $50 million less than these agencies currently receive.<ref name=HillThisWeek7>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=This week: Sportsmen's bill, appropriations|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/211332-this-week-appropriations-sportsmens-bill|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> The appropriations for the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] are made by this bill.

== Political positions ==
Simpson is a conservative member of the Republican Party. However, he is known to be pragmatic on certain issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1009.xml</ref> Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past, he has opposed "[[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]", or congressionally directed spending.

===Business===
Simpson supports an agenda of low taxes and pro-business policies.<ref>[http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/508538.html Idaho Statesman]</ref>

===2013 government shutdown===
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref name="King">{{cite news|last=King|first=Neil Jr.|title=Idaho Race Shows Split in Republican Donor Base|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303332904579226231084993234?mod=ITP_pageone_1|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2013-11-29}}</ref>

===Taxes===
When asked about the [[Grover Norquist#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Grover Norquist pledge]] to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, "Well, first the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever."<ref>{{YouTube|HFWRvZcRe08|Fox News}}</ref>

===Second Amendment===
Simpson was one of the Members of Congress to sign the [[D.C. v. Heller]] amicus brief which supported a recognition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as an individual right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_RespondentAmCuSenateHouseMembers.pdf |title=Brief of respondent for District of Columbia v. Heller, 07-290 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> As of Recent, he voted yes and helped to pass the "National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011".<ref>http://www.vote-smart.org/bill/14168/37348/2917/national-right-to-carry-reciprocity-act-of-2011</ref> Under this new law, which passed through the House of Representatives on November 16, 2011, people are allowed, with a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in other states, as long as those states allow concealed weapons and don't have specific rules about concealed weapons carried by nonresidents.<ref>See http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/192457-gop-looking-to-ease-concealed-weapons-rules-next-week</ref>

===Environment===
Simpson's hallmark legislation in the House of Representatives has been the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area.  Simpson has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club who claim the bill lacks "wilderness values"<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org">http://idaho.sierraclub.org/sawtooth/issues/CIEDRA/index.html</ref> because the bill allows for motorized access to certain portions of the wilderness area and some land federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3603</ref> Simpson has also faced opposition from groups who oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly because of restricted access to wilderness areas.<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org"/>

===Judgeship reorganization===
He also played a crucial role with the [[Ninth Circuit]] Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maplight.org/map/us/bill/11026/default/history |title=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2007 - Vote: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. &#124; History and Status &#124; MAPLight.org - Money and Politics |publisher=MAPLight.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Mike Simpson's goal is to amend [[title 28]], and create the appointment of additional [[Federal Circuit]] Judges, to divide the [[Ninth Judicial Circuit]] into two smaller judicial circuits.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-162&tab=committees</ref> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the actual House of Representatives.

===Health===
Following the death of Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]] (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding [[methamphetamine]], specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or "[[methmouth]]". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the [[oral health]] problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], make grants available to educate 12 to 17 year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to [[oral health]] and the provision of dental care.<ref>See http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html</ref> As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] to the [[Subcommittee on Health]] where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion. As soon as that happens, it will be brought up before the whole committee, then later the House of Representatives.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1671</ref>

Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded [[newborn screening|screening of newborns]] and children for heritable disorders.<ref name=cbo1281>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 1281|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45434|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn’s foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives."<ref name=RoyPR22>{{cite web|title=Rep. Roybal-Allard and Rep. Simpson introduce the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Authorization Act|url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=325195|publisher=House Office of Rep. Roybal-Allard|accessdate=24 June 2014|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

===Energy===
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear power]], extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development]], which oversees the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], a main site for nuclear and [[alternative energy]] research in the United States.

===Other===
Simpson is a strong supporter of the domestic [[sugar beet]] producers,<ref>[http://www.sugaralliance.org/newsroom/reps-melancon-and-simpson-named-house-sugar-caucus-chairs.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the Idaho potato growers.<ref>See http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/35363.html</ref> In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, [[Walt Minnick]], the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.<ref name="idahoreporter.com">http://www.idahoreporter.com/2010/minnick-and-simpson-working-on-getting-idaho-a-third-federal-judge/</ref>  Simpson was quoted as saying, "The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho’s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states."<ref name="idahoreporter.com"/>

Simpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda.  Simpson has announced his commitment to repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.<ref>''See'' http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_66f4c33a-43ff-11df-aaa4-001cc4c002e0.html</ref>  He is said to be close to and loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (20 December 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner’s toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>

==Public recognition==
''[[Esquire magazine]]'' listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.<ref name="esquire1">{{cite web|last=David |first=Elliott |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/10-best-members-congress-text?click=main_sr |title=10 Best Members of Congress - Election 2008 |publisher=Esquire |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The magazine said of Simpson, "More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground..."<ref name="esquire1"/> The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by [[Henry Clay]]: "Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively." This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.<ref>See http://www.hcn.org/issues/338/16795</ref>

Simpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of [[John Boehner]] (R-OH) to the position of [[House Majority Leader]] in the [[109th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/207/story/14316.html |title=Ties to House leader pay off for Simpson, Idaho &#124; Dan Popkey's reporting and columns |publisher=Idaho Statesman |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the [[Speaker Pro Tempore]] of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order.  This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] (R-IL) as a joke.  When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Mr. Simpson began once again to serve frequently as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House.

He has been supported by a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, which helps pragmatic Republicans who are willing to work across party lines.<ref name="King"/>

==Political campaigns==
Simpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by [[Mike Crapo]], who was running for [[United States Senate]]. He defeated former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Richard H. Stallings]] in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative [[Jim D. Hansen]], son of former Republican Congressman [[Orval H. Hansen]], to win reelection.

During the 2008 Presidential primaries, Simpson was an early supporter of former Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]] and a member of his Congressional Whip Team.<ref>http://www.politicalbase.com/people/mitt-romney/14237/supporters/</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Posted by pb |url=http://2008romney.blogspot.com/2007/02/whip-team-for-mitt-romney.html |title=Mitt Romney 2008: Whip Team for Mitt Romney |publisher=2008romney.blogspot.com |date=2007-02-06 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

==Larry Craig scandal==
During the 2007 scandal involving Senator [[Larry Craig]] (R-ID), Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the U.S. Senate in the event that Senator Craig resigned.  Simpson, however, asked Governor [[Butch Otter|C.L. "Butch" Otter]] to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]].

Simpson rankled Senate leadership during the Craig scandal by criticizing them for their treatment of the Senator. Simpson is quoted as saying, "If that’s how they treat their own, that tells me they’re more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party."<ref name="thehill2007">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/lashing-out-at-mcconnell-2007-09-07.html |title=News Archive |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson is not known to have condoned Craig's alleged misconduct, but he demanded that Craig be treated fairly. For example, he is quoted as saying, "They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven’t said a thing about."<ref name="thehill2007"/>

'''Michael Keith "Mike" Simpson''', [[Dental degree|D.M.D.]] (born September 8, 1950), is a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], representing {{ushr|Idaho|2|}}. First elected in 1998, he is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and previously served in the [[Idaho Legislature|state legislature]] in Idaho.

==Early life, education and career==
Born in [[Burley, Idaho|Burley]], Simpson was raised in [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]], where his father was a [[dentist]]. He graduated from [[Blackfoot High School]] in 1968, [[Utah State University]] in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]] in 1972, and the [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] [[Washington University School of Dental Medicine|School of Dental Medicine]]<ref>The Washington University School of Dental Medicine, 1866-1991 http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/dental/history/index.html</ref> in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1977.<ref name=ocd2011>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fVSkbYQp6qgC&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=United States Congress|title=Official Congressional Directory, 2011-2012: 112th Congress |year=2011|page=83}}</ref> Simpson practiced dentistry in Blackfoot until his election to [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1998#Idaho|1998]]. He was elected to the Blackfoot City Council in 1980 and was elected to the [[Idaho Legislature|state legislature]] in 1984, the first of seven terms. Simpson was the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Idaho House of Representatives|Idaho House]] prior to his election to Congress.

While some members of Congress with a medical background prefer to be addressed as "Doctor" (most notably former [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20181.html|title=Honorable? Former lawmakers mull title - Daniel Libit |publisher=Politico.Com|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson does not insist that he be referred to as Dr. Simpson, preferring to simply go by Congressman or Mr. Simpson.

In the [[111th United States Congress]] Simpson became the [[Ranking Member]] on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Upon assuming this position, and the subsequent chairmanship of the subcommittee, Mr. Simpson is considered a "Cardinal" (a term applied to the chairmen or ranking members of the Appropriations Subcommittees) within the House Republican Caucus. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee.<ref name="thehill1">{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/11/25/simpson-replaces-young-on-gop-steering-committee |title=Blog Briefing Room - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Briefingroom.thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Known as the "committee of committees", the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/11/25/simpson-replaces-young-on-gop-steering-committee/ |title=Blog Briefing Room - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Briefingroom.thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson replaced Congressman [[Don Young]] (R-AK) on the committee.<ref name="thehill1"/>

==Legislation==
On March 21, 2014, Simpson introduced the bill [[To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to maintain or replace certain facilities and structures for commercial recreation services at Smith Gulch in Idaho (H.R. 4283; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4238allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4238 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4283/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] to permit private entities to repair or replace certain commercial facilities on [[United States Forest Service]] land in [[Idaho]].<ref name=cbo4283>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4283|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45517|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "this legislation clarifies Congress' intent of the 2004 amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which continued the existing use and occupancy of commercial services in this corridor of the Salmon River."<ref name=SimpsonPR>{{cite web|title=Simpson Bill to Authorize Facilities Maintenance on Salmon River Passes House|url=http://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=392777|publisher=House Office of Rep. Mike Simpson|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=8 September 2014}}</ref>

On June 20, 2014, Simpson introduced the [[Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4923; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would make [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015.<ref name=4923sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4923 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4923|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is only $50 million less than these agencies currently receive.<ref name=HillThisWeek7>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=This week: Sportsmen's bill, appropriations|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/211332-this-week-appropriations-sportsmens-bill|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> The appropriations for the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] are made by this bill.

== Political positions ==
Simpson is a conservative member of the Republican Party. However, he is known to be pragmatic on certain issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1009.xml</ref> Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past, he has opposed "[[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]", or congressionally directed spending.

===Business===
Simpson supports an agenda of low taxes and pro-business policies.<ref>[http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/508538.html Idaho Statesman]</ref>

===2013 government shutdown===
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref name="King">{{cite news|last=King|first=Neil Jr.|title=Idaho Race Shows Split in Republican Donor Base|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303332904579226231084993234?mod=ITP_pageone_1|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2013-11-29}}</ref>

===Taxes===
When asked about the [[Grover Norquist#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Grover Norquist pledge]] to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, "Well, first the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever."<ref>{{YouTube|HFWRvZcRe08|Fox News}}</ref>

===Second Amendment===
Simpson was one of the Members of Congress to sign the [[D.C. v. Heller]] amicus brief which supported a recognition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as an individual right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_RespondentAmCuSenateHouseMembers.pdf |title=Brief of respondent for District of Columbia v. Heller, 07-290 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> As of Recent, he voted yes and helped to pass the "National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011".<ref>http://www.vote-smart.org/bill/14168/37348/2917/national-right-to-carry-reciprocity-act-of-2011</ref> Under this new law, which passed through the House of Representatives on November 16, 2011, people are allowed, with a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in other states, as long as those states allow concealed weapons and don't have specific rules about concealed weapons carried by nonresidents.<ref>See http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/192457-gop-looking-to-ease-concealed-weapons-rules-next-week</ref>

===Environment===
Simpson's hallmark legislation in the House of Representatives has been the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area.  Simpson has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club who claim the bill lacks "wilderness values"<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org">http://idaho.sierraclub.org/sawtooth/issues/CIEDRA/index.html</ref> because the bill allows for motorized access to certain portions of the wilderness area and some land federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3603</ref> Simpson has also faced opposition from groups who oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly because of restricted access to wilderness areas.<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org"/>

===Judgeship reorganization===
He also played a crucial role with the [[Ninth Circuit]] Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maplight.org/map/us/bill/11026/default/history |title=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2007 - Vote: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. &#124; History and Status &#124; MAPLight.org - Money and Politics |publisher=MAPLight.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Mike Simpson's goal is to amend [[title 28]], and create the appointment of additional [[Federal Circuit]] Judges, to divide the [[Ninth Judicial Circuit]] into two smaller judicial circuits.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-162&tab=committees</ref> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the actual House of Representatives.

===Health===
Following the death of Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]] (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding [[methamphetamine]], specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or "[[methmouth]]". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the [[oral health]] problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], make grants available to educate 12 to 17 year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to [[oral health]] and the provision of dental care.<ref>See http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html</ref> As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] to the [[Subcommittee on Health]] where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion. As soon as that happens, it will be brought up before the whole committee, then later the House of Representatives.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1671</ref>

Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded [[newborn screening|screening of newborns]] and children for heritable disorders.<ref name=cbo1281>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 1281|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45434|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn’s foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives."<ref name=RoyPR22>{{cite web|title=Rep. Roybal-Allard and Rep. Simpson introduce the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Authorization Act|url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=325195|publisher=House Office of Rep. Roybal-Allard|accessdate=24 June 2014|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

===Energy===
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear power]], extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development]], which oversees the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], a main site for nuclear and [[alternative energy]] research in the United States.

===Other===
Simpson is a strong supporter of the domestic [[sugar beet]] producers,<ref>[http://www.sugaralliance.org/newsroom/reps-melancon-and-simpson-named-house-sugar-caucus-chairs.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the Idaho potato growers.<ref>See http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/35363.html</ref> In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, [[Walt Minnick]], the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.<ref name="idahoreporter.com">http://www.idahoreporter.com/2010/minnick-and-simpson-working-on-getting-idaho-a-third-federal-judge/</ref>  Simpson was quoted as saying, "The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho’s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states."<ref name="idahoreporter.com"/>

Simpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda.  Simpson has announced his commitment to repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.<ref>''See'' http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_66f4c33a-43ff-11df-aaa4-001cc4c002e0.html</ref>  He is said to be close to and loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (20 December 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner’s toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>

==Public recognition==
''[[Esquire magazine]]'' listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.<ref name="esquire1">{{cite web|last=David |first=Elliott |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/10-best-members-congress-text?click=main_sr |title=10 Best Members of Congress - Election 2008 |publisher=Esquire |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The magazine said of Simpson, "More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground..."<ref name="esquire1"/> The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by [[Henry Clay]]: "Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively." This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.<ref>See http://www.hcn.org/issues/338/16795</ref>

Simpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of [[John Boehner]] (R-OH) to the position of [[House Majority Leader]] in the [[109th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/207/story/14316.html |title=Ties to House leader pay off for Simpson, Idaho &#124; Dan Popkey's reporting and columns |publisher=Idaho Statesman |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the [[Speaker Pro Tempore]] of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order.  This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] (R-IL) as a joke.  When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Mr. Simpson began once again to serve frequently as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House.

He has been supported by a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, which helps pragmatic Republicans who are willing to work across party lines.<ref name="King"/>

==Political campaigns==
Simpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by [[Mike Crapo]], who was running for [[United States Senate]]. He defeated former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Richard H. Stallings]] in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative [[Jim D. Hansen]], son of former Republican Congressman [[Orval H. Hansen]], to win reelection.

==Larry Craig scandal==
During the 2007 scandal involving Senator [[Larry Craig]] (R-ID), Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the U.S. Senate in the event that Senator Craig resigned.  Simpson, however, asked Governor [[Butch Otter|C.L. "Butch" Otter]] to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]].

Simpson rankled Senate leadership during the Craig scandal by criticizing them for their treatment of the Senator. Simpson is quoted as saying, "If that’s how they treat their own, that tells me they’re more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party."<ref name="thehill2007">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/lashing-out-at-mcconnell-2007-09-07.html |title=News Archive |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson is not known to have condoned Craig's alleged misconduct, but he demanded that Craig be treated fairly. For example, he is quoted as saying, "They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven’t said a thing about."<ref name="thehill2007"/>

'''Michael Keith "Mike" Simpson''', [[Dental degree|D.M.D.]] (born September 8, 1950), is a member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]], representing {{ushr|Idaho|2|}}. First elected in 1998, he is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and previously served in the [[Idaho Legislature|state legislature]] in Idaho.

==Early life, education and career==
Born in [[Burley, Idaho|Burley]], Simpson was raised in [[Blackfoot, Idaho|Blackfoot]], where his father was a [[dentist]]. He graduated from [[Blackfoot High School]] in 1968, [[Utah State University]] in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]] in 1972, and the [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] [[Washington University School of Dental Medicine|School of Dental Medicine]]<ref>The Washington University School of Dental Medicine, 1866-1991 http://beckerexhibits.wustl.edu/dental/history/index.html</ref> in [[St. Louis, Missouri]], in 1977.<ref name=ocd2011>{{cite book|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=fVSkbYQp6qgC&pg=PA83&lpg=PA83#v=onepage&q&f=false|publisher=United States Congress|title=Official Congressional Directory, 2011-2012: 112th Congress |year=2011|page=83}}</ref> Simpson practiced dentistry in Blackfoot until his election to [[United States House of Representatives|Congress]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1998#Idaho|1998]]. He was elected to the Blackfoot City Council in 1980 and was elected to the [[Idaho Legislature|state legislature]] in 1984, the first of seven terms. Simpson was the [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Idaho House of Representatives|Idaho House]] prior to his election to Congress.

While some members of Congress with a medical background prefer to be addressed as "Doctor" (most notably former [[Senate Majority Leader]] [[Bill Frist]]),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0309/20181.html|title=Honorable? Former lawmakers mull title - Daniel Libit |publisher=Politico.Com|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson does not insist that he be referred to as Dr. Simpson, preferring to simply go by Congressman or Mr. Simpson.

In the [[111th United States Congress]] Simpson became the [[Ranking Member]] on the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Subcommittee. Upon assuming this position, and the subsequent chairmanship of the subcommittee, Mr. Simpson is considered a "Cardinal" (a term applied to the chairmen or ranking members of the Appropriations Subcommittees) within the House Republican Caucus. He also serves as the small state representative on the 33-member House Republican Steering Committee.<ref name="thehill1">{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/11/25/simpson-replaces-young-on-gop-steering-committee |title=Blog Briefing Room - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Briefingroom.thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Known as the "committee of committees", the Steering Committee decides which Republican lawmakers become ranking members on House committees.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/2008/11/25/simpson-replaces-young-on-gop-steering-committee/ |title=Blog Briefing Room - The Hill's Blog Briefing Room |publisher=Briefingroom.thehill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson replaced Congressman [[Don Young]] (R-AK) on the committee.<ref name="thehill1"/>

==Legislation==
On March 21, 2014, Simpson introduced the bill [[To amend the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act to authorize the Secretary of the Interior to maintain or replace certain facilities and structures for commercial recreation services at Smith Gulch in Idaho (H.R. 4283; 113th Congress)]].<ref name=4238allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4238 - All Actions|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4283/all-actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[United States Secretary of Agriculture]] to permit private entities to repair or replace certain commercial facilities on [[United States Forest Service]] land in [[Idaho]].<ref name=cbo4283>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4283|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45517|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=9 September 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "this legislation clarifies Congress' intent of the 2004 amendments to the Wild and Scenic Rivers Act which continued the existing use and occupancy of commercial services in this corridor of the Salmon River."<ref name=SimpsonPR>{{cite web|title=Simpson Bill to Authorize Facilities Maintenance on Salmon River Passes House|url=http://simpson.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=392777|publisher=House Office of Rep. Mike Simpson|accessdate=9 September 2014|date=8 September 2014}}</ref>

On June 20, 2014, Simpson introduced the [[Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4923; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would make [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] for energy and water development and related agencies for FY2015.<ref name=4923sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4923 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4923|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=10 July 2014}}</ref> The bill would appropriate $34 billion, which is only $50 million less than these agencies currently receive.<ref name=HillThisWeek7>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=This week: Sportsmen's bill, appropriations|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/211332-this-week-appropriations-sportsmens-bill|accessdate=10 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=7 July 2014}}</ref> The appropriations for the [[United States Department of Energy]] and the [[United States Army Corps of Engineers]] are made by this bill.

== Political positions ==
Simpson is a conservative member of the Republican Party. However, he is known to be pragmatic on certain issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1009.xml</ref> Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past, he has opposed "[[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]", or congressionally directed spending.

===Business===
Simpson supports an agenda of low taxes and pro-business policies.<ref>[http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/508538.html Idaho Statesman]</ref>

===2013 government shutdown===
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref name="King">{{cite news|last=King|first=Neil Jr.|title=Idaho Race Shows Split in Republican Donor Base|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303332904579226231084993234?mod=ITP_pageone_1|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2013-11-29}}</ref>

===Taxes===
When asked about the [[Grover Norquist#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Grover Norquist pledge]] to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, "Well, first the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever."<ref>{{YouTube|HFWRvZcRe08|Fox News}}</ref>

===Second Amendment===
Simpson was one of the Members of Congress to sign the [[D.C. v. Heller]] amicus brief which supported a recognition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as an individual right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_RespondentAmCuSenateHouseMembers.pdf |title=Brief of respondent for District of Columbia v. Heller, 07-290 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> As of Recent, he voted yes and helped to pass the "National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011".<ref>http://www.vote-smart.org/bill/14168/37348/2917/national-right-to-carry-reciprocity-act-of-2011</ref> Under this new law, which passed through the House of Representatives on November 16, 2011, people are allowed, with a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in other states, as long as those states allow concealed weapons and don't have specific rules about concealed weapons carried by nonresidents.<ref>See http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/192457-gop-looking-to-ease-concealed-weapons-rules-next-week</ref>

===Environment===
Simpson's hallmark legislation in the House of Representatives has been the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area.  Simpson has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club who claim the bill lacks "wilderness values"<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org">http://idaho.sierraclub.org/sawtooth/issues/CIEDRA/index.html</ref> because the bill allows for motorized access to certain portions of the wilderness area and some land federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3603</ref> Simpson has also faced opposition from groups who oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly because of restricted access to wilderness areas.<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org"/>

===Judgeship reorganization===
He also played a crucial role with the [[Ninth Circuit]] Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maplight.org/map/us/bill/11026/default/history |title=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2007 - Vote: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. &#124; History and Status &#124; MAPLight.org - Money and Politics |publisher=MAPLight.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Mike Simpson's goal is to amend [[title 28]], and create the appointment of additional [[Federal Circuit]] Judges, to divide the [[Ninth Judicial Circuit]] into two smaller judicial circuits.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-162&tab=committees</ref> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the actual House of Representatives.

===Health===
Following the death of Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]] (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding [[methamphetamine]], specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or "[[methmouth]]". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the [[oral health]] problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], make grants available to educate 12 to 17 year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to [[oral health]] and the provision of dental care.<ref>See http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html</ref> As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] to the [[Subcommittee on Health]] where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion. As soon as that happens, it will be brought up before the whole committee, then later the House of Representatives.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1671</ref>

Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded [[newborn screening|screening of newborns]] and children for heritable disorders.<ref name=cbo1281>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 1281|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45434|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn’s foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives."<ref name=RoyPR22>{{cite web|title=Rep. Roybal-Allard and Rep. Simpson introduce the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Authorization Act|url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=325195|publisher=House Office of Rep. Roybal-Allard|accessdate=24 June 2014|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

===Energy===
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear power]], extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development]], which oversees the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], a main site for nuclear and [[alternative energy]] research in the United States.

===Other===
Simpson is a strong supporter of the domestic [[sugar beet]] producers,<ref>[http://www.sugaralliance.org/newsroom/reps-melancon-and-simpson-named-house-sugar-caucus-chairs.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the Idaho potato growers.<ref>See http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/35363.html</ref> In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, [[Walt Minnick]], the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.<ref name="idahoreporter.com">http://www.idahoreporter.com/2010/minnick-and-simpson-working-on-getting-idaho-a-third-federal-judge/</ref>  Simpson was quoted as saying, "The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho’s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states."<ref name="idahoreporter.com"/>

Simpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda.  Simpson has announced his commitment to repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.<ref>''See'' http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_66f4c33a-43ff-11df-aaa4-001cc4c002e0.html</ref>  He is said to be close to and loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (20 December 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner’s toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>

''[[Esquire magazine]]'' listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.<ref name="esquire1">{{cite web|last=David |first=Elliott |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/10-best-members-congress-text?click=main_sr |title=10 Best Members of Congress - Election 2008 |publisher=Esquire |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The magazine said of Simpson, "More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground..."<ref name="esquire1"/> The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by [[Henry Clay]]: "Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively." This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.<ref>See http://www.hcn.org/issues/338/16795</ref>

Simpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of [[John Boehner]] (R-OH) to the position of [[House Majority Leader]] in the [[109th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/207/story/14316.html |title=Ties to House leader pay off for Simpson, Idaho &#124; Dan Popkey's reporting and columns |publisher=Idaho Statesman |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the [[Speaker Pro Tempore]] of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order.  This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] (R-IL) as a joke.  When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Mr. Simpson began once again to serve frequently as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House.

He has been supported by a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, which helps pragmatic Republicans who are willing to work across party lines.<ref name="King"/>

==Political campaigns==
Simpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by [[Mike Crapo]], who was running for [[United States Senate]]. He defeated former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Richard H. Stallings]] in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative [[Jim D. Hansen]], son of former Republican Congressman [[Orval H. Hansen]], to win reelection.

==Larry Craig scandal==
During the 2007 scandal involving Senator [[Larry Craig]] (R-ID), Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the U.S. Senate in the event that Senator Craig resigned.  Simpson, however, asked Governor [[Butch Otter|C.L. "Butch" Otter]] to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]].

Simpson rankled Senate leadership during the Craig scandal by criticizing them for their treatment of the Senator. Simpson is quoted as saying, "If that’s how they treat their own, that tells me they’re more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party."<ref name="thehill2007">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/lashing-out-at-mcconnell-2007-09-07.html |title=News Archive |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson is not known to have condoned Craig's alleged misconduct, but he demanded that Craig be treated fairly. For example, he is quoted as saying, "They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven’t said a thing about."<ref name="thehill2007"/>

== Political positions ==
Simpson is a conservative member of the Republican Party. However, he is known to be pragmatic on certain issues. For example, he was one of a handful of Republicans to vote in favor of the reauthorization of the [[State Children's Health Insurance Program]] (SCHIP) in the 110th Congress.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2007/roll1009.xml</ref> Simpson has also been a supporter of the National Endowment of the Arts and the National Endowment of the Humanities, voting each year against Republican amendments to strip them of funding. In the past, he has opposed "[[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]]", or congressionally directed spending.

===Business===
Simpson supports an agenda of low taxes and pro-business policies.<ref>[http://www.idahostatesman.com/idahopolitics/story/508538.html Idaho Statesman]</ref>

===2013 government shutdown===
In October 2013, Simpson voted to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].<ref name="King">{{cite news|last=King|first=Neil Jr.|title=Idaho Race Shows Split in Republican Donor Base|url=http://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052702303332904579226231084993234?mod=ITP_pageone_1|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=2013-11-29}}</ref>

===Taxes===
When asked about the [[Grover Norquist#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Grover Norquist pledge]] to oppose any net increase in taxes, Simpson said, "Well, first the pledge: I signed that in 1998 when I first ran. I didn't know I was signing a marriage agreement that would last forever."<ref>{{YouTube|HFWRvZcRe08|Fox News}}</ref>

===Second Amendment===
Simpson was one of the Members of Congress to sign the [[D.C. v. Heller]] amicus brief which supported a recognition of the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] as an individual right.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.abanet.org/publiced/preview/briefs/pdfs/07-08/07-290_RespondentAmCuSenateHouseMembers.pdf |title=Brief of respondent for District of Columbia v. Heller, 07-290 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> As of Recent, he voted yes and helped to pass the "National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011".<ref>http://www.vote-smart.org/bill/14168/37348/2917/national-right-to-carry-reciprocity-act-of-2011</ref> Under this new law, which passed through the House of Representatives on November 16, 2011, people are allowed, with a valid license to carry a concealed weapon in other states, as long as those states allow concealed weapons and don't have specific rules about concealed weapons carried by nonresidents.<ref>See http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/192457-gop-looking-to-ease-concealed-weapons-rules-next-week</ref>

===Environment===
Simpson's hallmark legislation in the House of Representatives has been the Central Idaho Economic Development and Recreation Act (CIEDRA), which would create 312,000 acres of wilderness in central Idaho, much of which is currently a wilderness study area.  Simpson has faced substantial resistance from groups like the Sierra Club who claim the bill lacks "wilderness values"<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org">http://idaho.sierraclub.org/sawtooth/issues/CIEDRA/index.html</ref> because the bill allows for motorized access to certain portions of the wilderness area and some land federal land would be transferred to the State of Idaho to promote the economic development of the local community and the recreational use of National Forest land and other public lands in central Idaho.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-3603</ref> Simpson has also faced opposition from groups who oppose new federal land designations, and wilderness designations particularly because of restricted access to wilderness areas.<ref name="idaho.sierraclub.org"/>

===Judgeship reorganization===
He also played a crucial role with the [[Ninth Circuit]] Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.maplight.org/map/us/bill/11026/default/history |title=Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act of 2007 - Vote: Referred to the House Committee on the Judiciary. &#124; History and Status &#124; MAPLight.org - Money and Politics |publisher=MAPLight.org |date=2008-12-31 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Mike Simpson's goal is to amend [[title 28]], and create the appointment of additional [[Federal Circuit]] Judges, to divide the [[Ninth Judicial Circuit]] into two smaller judicial circuits.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-162&tab=committees</ref> The Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals Judgeship and Reorganization Act was introduced to House Judiciary Committee, and more specifically to the subcommittee on Courts and Competition Policy. Since Jan 24, 2011, the bill has been in the subcommittee, where it will be refined before being presented by to the Judiciary Committee, then later the actual House of Representatives.

===Health===
Following the death of Congressman [[Charlie Norwood]] (R-GA) in February, 2007, Simpson has become a leading advocate of the [[American Dental Association]] (ADA) in Congress, in part because his profession is dentistry. The advocacy inspired Simpson to introduce legislation regarding [[methamphetamine]], specifically how the drug affects tooth decay or "[[methmouth]]". The bill is formally called H.R. 1671: Meth Mouth Prevention and Community Recovery Act, with the purpose to understand and address the [[oral health]] problems associated with methamphetamine. The bill's goals are to expand and intensify the [[Department of Health and Human Services]], make grants available to educate 12 to 17 year-olds about methmouth, and to promote a series of education activities for all dentists to learn about substance use disorders and their relationship to [[oral health]] and the provision of dental care.<ref>See http://www.house.gov/list/press/id02_simpson/meth_mouth.html</ref> As of March 24, 2009, the bill was put from the [[House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] to the [[Subcommittee on Health]] where it has been debated, but never brought to a conclusion. As soon as that happens, it will be brought up before the whole committee, then later the House of Representatives.<ref>See http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1671</ref>

Simpson was an original co-sponsor of the [[Newborn Screening Saves Lives Reauthorization Act of 2013 (H.R. 1281; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] grant programs and other initiatives to promote expanded [[newborn screening|screening of newborns]] and children for heritable disorders.<ref name=cbo1281>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 1281|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45434|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Simpson said that "the bill reflects the realities of reduced budgets Washington, but continues and strengthens the well established system of monitoring and evaluating infant conditions soon after birth. Just one small blood sample from the newborn’s foot identifies infants with genetic or other conditions that can be treated quickly and effectively, saving and improving thousands of lives."<ref name=RoyPR22>{{cite web|title=Rep. Roybal-Allard and Rep. Simpson introduce the Newborn Screening Saves Lives Authorization Act|url=http://roybal-allard.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=325195|publisher=House Office of Rep. Roybal-Allard|accessdate=24 June 2014|date=22 March 2013}}</ref>

===Energy===
Simpson is also known as an outspoken proponent of [[nuclear power]], extolling its virtues as an environmentally friendly source of energy with minimal carbon output. Simpson's support for this form of energy plays a significant role in his membership of the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development]], which oversees the [[Idaho National Laboratory]], a main site for nuclear and [[alternative energy]] research in the United States.

===Other===
Simpson is a strong supporter of the domestic [[sugar beet]] producers,<ref>[http://www.sugaralliance.org/newsroom/reps-melancon-and-simpson-named-house-sugar-caucus-chairs.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref> and the Idaho potato growers.<ref>See http://www.mcclatchydc.com/244/story/35363.html</ref> In 2010, Simpson took up the cause, alongside his former Democratic colleague, [[Walt Minnick]], the lead sponsor of the bill, to secure a third federal judge for Idaho.<ref name="idahoreporter.com">http://www.idahoreporter.com/2010/minnick-and-simpson-working-on-getting-idaho-a-third-federal-judge/</ref>  Simpson was quoted as saying, "The caseload of the Idaho District Court has increased significantly in recent decades resulting in Idaho’s district judges carrying a disproportionate share of cases in relation to their colleagues in other states."<ref name="idahoreporter.com"/>

Simpson has become increasing opposed to President Obama and the Congressional Democrats' policy agenda.  Simpson has announced his commitment to repealing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], questioning its constitutionality and effectiveness.<ref>''See'' http://www.idahostatejournal.com/news/local/article_66f4c33a-43ff-11df-aaa4-001cc4c002e0.html</ref>  He is said to be close to and loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (20 December 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner’s toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>

==Public recognition==
''[[Esquire magazine]]'' listed Simpson as one of the 10 Best Members of Congress in October 2008.<ref name="esquire1">{{cite web|last=David |first=Elliott |url=http://www.esquire.com/features/esquire-endorsements-2008/10-best-members-congress-text?click=main_sr |title=10 Best Members of Congress - Election 2008 |publisher=Esquire |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> The magazine said of Simpson, "More than any other representative, Simpson lives by the philosophy that democratic representation is a matter of finding not advantageous positions but common ground..."<ref name="esquire1"/> The magazine's portrayal of Simpson echoes one of his personal philosophies, which is embodied in a quote by [[Henry Clay]]: "Politics is not about ideological purity or moral self-righteousness. It is about governing, and if a politician cannot compromise he cannot govern effectively." This quote is framed and hangs in Simpson's Washington D.C. office.<ref>See http://www.hcn.org/issues/338/16795</ref>

Simpson has been credited as having a key role in the election of [[John Boehner]] (R-OH) to the position of [[House Majority Leader]] in the [[109th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.idahostatesman.com/207/story/14316.html |title=Ties to House leader pay off for Simpson, Idaho &#124; Dan Popkey's reporting and columns |publisher=Idaho Statesman |date=2006-10-13 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

While the Republican Party held the majority in the U.S. House of Representatives, Simpson often served as the [[Speaker Pro Tempore]] of the House, particularly during debates concerning controversial legislation, due to his command of House procedure. Simpson is known to have broken several sounding boards with the gavel while calling the House to order.  This inspired Simpson to have a number of sounding boards produced in Idaho, which he presented to then Speaker of the House [[Dennis Hastert]] (R-IL) as a joke.  When the Republican Party regained control of the House of Representatives in 2010, Mr. Simpson began once again to serve frequently as the Speaker Pro Tempore of the House.

He has been supported by a PAC affiliated with the Republican Main Street Partnership, which helps pragmatic Republicans who are willing to work across party lines.<ref name="King"/>

==Political campaigns==
Simpson entered the 1998 campaign for the U.S. House seat vacated by [[Mike Crapo]], who was running for [[United States Senate]]. He defeated former [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Richard H. Stallings]] in the general election. Simpson did not face serious opposition in 2002 and 2004. In 2006 Simpson defeated former Democratic state representative [[Jim D. Hansen]], son of former Republican Congressman [[Orval H. Hansen]], to win reelection.

==Larry Craig scandal==
During the 2007 scandal involving Senator [[Larry Craig]] (R-ID), Simpson was openly considered for an appointment to the U.S. Senate in the event that Senator Craig resigned.  Simpson, however, asked Governor [[Butch Otter|C.L. "Butch" Otter]] to remove his name from consideration, claiming that the Idaho Congressional Delegation would be in a better position if he were to remain in the House and retain his seniority on the House [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]].

Simpson rankled Senate leadership during the Craig scandal by criticizing them for their treatment of the Senator. Simpson is quoted as saying, "If that’s how they treat their own, that tells me they’re more interested in party than individuals, and the party is made up of individuals. How you treat them says a lot about your party."<ref name="thehill2007">{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/lashing-out-at-mcconnell-2007-09-07.html |title=News Archive |publisher=TheHill.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Simpson is not known to have condoned Craig's alleged misconduct, but he demanded that Craig be treated fairly. For example, he is quoted as saying, "They have people over there [in the Senate Republican Conference] in far worse trouble that they haven’t said a thing about."<ref name="thehill2007"/>
