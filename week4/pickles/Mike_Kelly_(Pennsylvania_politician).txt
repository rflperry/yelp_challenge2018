[[Kathy Dahlkemper]] in 2010.<ref>http://www.goerie.com/apps/pbs.dll/article?AID=/20101103/NEWS02/311029900/-1/news</ref> He won the election by 10.2%,<ref>http://projects.usatoday.com/news/politics/2010/elections/?loc=interstitialskip</ref> largely by running up his margins outside of heavily Democratic Erie.

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 3}}
Kelly defeated Democrat Missa Eaton 55%-41%.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2012-election/map/#/House/2012/PA</ref>  His district had been made slightly friendlier in redistricting. The district was pushed slightly to the south, absorbing some rural and Republican territory east of Pittsburgh.

Kelly is being challenged by Democratic candidate Dan LaVallee of Cranberry Township, Pittsburgh.<ref>http://www.ncnewsonline.com/opinion/x1974698758/Republicans-seeking-Sainato-seat?mobRedir=false</ref>

===Tenure===
On July 25, 2012, Kelly delivered a speech on the House floor regarding federal employment regulations that received a rare standing ovation. The video has been viewed more than 800,000 times.<ref>{{YouTube|F1YQDjpuY_U|July 25, 2012 House Floor Speech}}</ref><ref>"[http://www.theblaze.com/stories/see-the-speech-that-got-a-standing-ovation-in-congress-today/ See the Speech That Got a Standing Ovation Today]", ''The Blaze''</ref>

On August 1, 2012, Rep. Kelly held a [[press conference]] to mark the effective date of the controversial HHS mandate, which is the subject of more than 20 lawsuits and which has been decried by religious freedom advocates as a violation of the [[First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution|First Amendment]] of the [[U.S. Constitution]]. In his remarks, he said the mandate was an attack on Americans' constitutionally protected religious rights and that August 1, 2012, would go down in infamy as "the day that religious freedom died".<ref>http://cnsnews.com/news/article/congressman-were-still-home-brave-were-not-land-free-anymore</ref>

===Committee assignments===
[http://waysandmeans.house.gov/ Committee on Ways and Means]

===Comparison of Environmental Protection Agency to Terrorists===
On July 28, 2014, Kelly compared the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] to [[terrorists]] while speaking at an event hosted by the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]], where he attacked rules limiting power plant emissions.

<blockquote>“You talk about terrorism — you can do it in a lot of different ways,” he said. “But you terrorize the people who supply everything this country needs to be great — and you keep them on the sidelines — my goodness, what have we become?”<ref>http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/07/28/3465030/house-republican-climate-rule-terrorism/</ref>
