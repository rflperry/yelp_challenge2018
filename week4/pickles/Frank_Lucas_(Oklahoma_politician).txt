[[Image:Frank Lucas2.jpg|thumb|right|Oklahoma Congressman Frank Lucas speaks at a town hall meeting held in the Pioneer Technology Center in Ponca City, Oklahoma on September 26, 2011.]]
In 1994, 6th district Congressman [[Glenn English]] stepped down to become a [[lobbyist]] for [[rural electric cooperative]]s. Lucas won the Republican nomination for the special election on May 10. He faced Dan Webber, [[press secretary]] to former [[Governor of Oklahoma|Governor]] and [[U.S. Senator]] [[David L. Boren]], now president of the [[University of Oklahoma]]. The 6th was already the largest in the state, stretching from the Panhandle to the town of [[Spencer, Oklahoma|Spencer]], in the far northeastern [[Oklahoma City]] metropolitan area. However, the [[Oklahoma Legislature|state legislature]] had redrawn it so that it included many poor Oklahoma City neighborhoods that had never voted Republican. Lucas scored a major upset; he won by eight percentage points, carrying 18 of the district's 24 [[County (US)|counties]]. His victory has been seen by some pundits as an early sign of the wave six months later that saw the Republicans take control of the House for the first time in 40 years. Lucas himself won a full term in that wave and has been re-elected seven times, never dropping below 59 percent of the vote, and even ran unopposed in 2002 and 2004.

Lucas' district was renumbered as the 3rd after Oklahoma lost a district in the 2000 Census. His district, already by far the largest in the state, was made even larger. He lost most of his old district's share of Oklahoma City, which was home to 60 percent of the district's population. He once represented much of the downtown area, including the site of the [[Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building]]. He still represents that portion of the city located in [[Canadian County, Oklahoma|Canadian County]].  To make up for this large population loss, the 3rd was pushed further to the east, picking up part of the Tulsa area (including a small portion of Tulsa itself) and some rural areas. As a result, his district now includes 48.5 percent of the state's land mass, and is large as the state's other four districts combined.

=== 2014 Republican primary ===
In the 2014 Republican primary, Lucas won 83% of the vote. 12% went to Robert Hubbard; and 5% went to [[Timothy Ray Murray]].<ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/files/elections/2014/by_state/OK_US_House_0624.html?SITE=AP&SECTION=POLITICS  "Oklahoma - Summary Vote Results June 25, 2014 - 05:28PM ET" ''Associated Press'']</ref>
