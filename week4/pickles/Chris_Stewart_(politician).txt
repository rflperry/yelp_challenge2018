===Legislation===
Stewart has sponsored eight bills of his own, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Stewart's Legislation|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/R?d113:FLD003:@1%28Rep.+Stewart+%20Chris%29:|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

* H.R. 758, a bill to prohibit national parks and monuments in Utah from being expanded, introduced February 15, 2013
* H.R. 4682, a bill to allow individuals eligible for [[TRICARE]] to opt out of the program and be permitted to make payments to a [[health savings account]] in place of receiving coverage under TRICARE, introduced May 20, 2014
* H.R. 4934, a bill to prohibit all federal agencies, excluding the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], the [[U.S. Capitol Police]], the [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]], and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], from purchasing and using firearms, and to direct the Inspector General to submit annual reports to Congress detailing aspects of these purchases by federal agencies, introduced June 23, 2014
* H.R. 5058, a bill to allow states and tribal governments to gain authority over all regulations pertaining to horses and burros on lands within their boundaries, introduced July 10, 2014

Stewart cosponsored the [[Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2413; 113th Congress)]] and sponsored the substitute amendment which replaced the text of the original legislation. Stewart said the bill "prioritizes protection of public safety and forward-looking weather research, improves procurement of observing system data from space, air, and land, and opens up NOAA's process to encourage private sector weather solutions."<ref name=Stewartstatement>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Chris|title=Statement of Environment Subcommittee Chairman Chris Stewart|url=http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/images/HHRG-113-%20SY18-WState-S001192-20130709.pdf|publisher=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Stewart is the sponsor of H.R. 1422, titled the "EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2014", which would reform the composition and activities of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) science advisory board. At least 10% of the members of the board would be required to be from state, local, or tribal governments. Corporate and industry experts would no longer be excluded from the board and board members would be prohibited from advising the EPA in discussions that cite their work. While the bill's supporters believe that it would increase transparency and balance in the EPA, critics argue that it "turns the idea of conflict of interest on its head" and would restrict scientists' ability to provide proper advice to the government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=November 18, 2014|title=House passes bill to reform EPA science panel|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/224615-house-passes-bill-to-reform-epa-science-panel|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://democrats.science.house.gov/sites/democrats.science.house.gov/files/documents/Letter%20opposing%20EPA%20SAB%20Reform%20Act%20HR%201422%20.pdf|title=A letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists to the House of Representatives|date=November 17, 2014|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

===Bureau of Land Management Issues===
In an interview regarding the [[Bundy standoff]] of April and May 2014, Stewart stated his opinion that the [[Bureau of Land Management]] could have avoided the standoff by allowing local sheriffs to intervene. Citing concerns about the level of weaponry carried by federal agents, he also sponsored a bill (H.R.4934) to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Glionna|first1=John|title=BLM, local law enforcement tensions near breaking point in the West|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-blm-critics-20140805-story.html|website=www.latimes.com|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.4934 - Regulatory Agency Demilitarization Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4934/text|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>

===Legislation===
Stewart has sponsored eight bills of his own, including:<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Stewart's Legislation|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/R?d113:FLD003:@1%28Rep.+Stewart+%20Chris%29:|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

* H.R. 758, a bill to prohibit national parks and monuments in Utah from being expanded, introduced February 15, 2013
* H.R. 4682, a bill to allow individuals eligible for [[TRICARE]] to opt out of the program and be permitted to make payments to a [[health savings account]] in place of receiving coverage under TRICARE, introduced May 20, 2014
* H.R. 4934, a bill to prohibit all federal agencies, excluding the Departments of Defense, Justice, and Homeland Security, the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission]], the [[U.S. Capitol Police]], the [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]], and the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], from purchasing and using firearms, and to direct the Inspector General to submit annual reports to Congress detailing aspects of these purchases by federal agencies, introduced June 23, 2014
* H.R. 5058, a bill to allow states and tribal governments to gain authority over all regulations pertaining to horses and burros on lands within their boundaries, introduced July 10, 2014

Stewart cosponsored the [[Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2413; 113th Congress)]] and sponsored the substitute amendment which replaced the text of the original legislation. Stewart said the bill "prioritizes protection of public safety and forward-looking weather research, improves procurement of observing system data from space, air, and land, and opens up NOAA's process to encourage private sector weather solutions."<ref name=Stewartstatement>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Chris|title=Statement of Environment Subcommittee Chairman Chris Stewart|url=http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/images/HHRG-113-%20SY18-WState-S001192-20130709.pdf|publisher=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Stewart is the sponsor of H.R. 1422, titled the "EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2014", which would reform the composition and activities of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) science advisory board. At least 10% of the members of the board would be required to be from state, local, or tribal governments. Corporate and industry experts would no longer be excluded from the board and board members would be prohibited from advising the EPA in discussions that cite their work. While the bill's supporters believe that it would increase transparency and balance in the EPA, critics argue that it "turns the idea of conflict of interest on its head" and would restrict scientists' ability to provide proper advice to the government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=November 18, 2014|title=House passes bill to reform EPA science panel|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/224615-house-passes-bill-to-reform-epa-science-panel|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://democrats.science.house.gov/sites/democrats.science.house.gov/files/documents/Letter%20opposing%20EPA%20SAB%20Reform%20Act%20HR%201422%20.pdf|title=A letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists to the House of Representatives|date=November 17, 2014|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

===Bureau of Land Management Issues===
In an interview regarding the [[Bundy standoff]] of April and May 2014, Stewart stated his opinion that the [[Bureau of Land Management]] could have avoided the standoff by allowing local sheriffs to intervene. Citing concerns about the level of weaponry carried by federal agents, he also sponsored a bill (H.R.4934) to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Glionna|first1=John|title=BLM, local law enforcement tensions near breaking point in the West|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-blm-critics-20140805-story.html|website=www.latimes.com|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.4934 - Regulatory Agency Demilitarization Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4934/text|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life and education==
Stewart was born in [[Logan, Utah|Logan]], [[Utah]], and grew up on a dairy farm in [[Cache Valley]], an agricultural valley of northern [[Utah]] and southeastern [[Idaho]]. His father was a retired Air Force Pilot and teacher. His mother, Sybil S. Stewart, was a full-time homemaker and was recognized as the Utah Mother of the Year in 1996.<ref>{{cite web | first = Douglas| last = Palmer| title = Mothers honored for the love and service they give families| publisher = Deseret News| url = http://www.deseretnews.com/article/471021/MOTHERS-HONORED-FOR-THE-LOVE-AND-SERVICE-THEY-GIVE-FAMILIES.html|accessdate = 2011-11-11 }}</ref>

Stewart graduated from [[Sky View High School]] in 1978 and entered [[Utah State University]] in the fall of the same year. After a year in college, Stewart took a break and served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in [[Texas]]. After his church service, Stewart re-entered Utah State University, and in 1984 earned a degree in economics from the [[Jon M. Huntsman School of Business]].

==Military service==
Stewart served in the Air Force for 14 years, primarily flying rescue helicopters and the [[Rockwell B-1 Lancer|B-1B bomber]]. He was stationed at [[Dyess Air Force Base]], [[Mountain Home Air Force Base]], and other Air Force bases.

===Training===
After college, Stewart was accepted into the Air Force's [[Officer Training School]]. He was also accepted into Undergraduate Pilot Training. Stewart was awarded the Distinguished Graduate (top of the class) in both endeavors. As the distinguished graduate, Stewart was trained to fly helicopters and jet-aircraft. Only two officers are accepted into this dual-training program per year.

===World records===
In 1995, Stewart was awarded the [[Mackay Trophy]] for "significant aerial achievement" for the combat capability operation known as [[Coronet Bat]]. On June 3, 1995, Chris and a flight of two B-1s set the world record for the fastest non-stop flight around the world. Stewart was the senior project officer for this mission. The purpose of the mission was to demonstrate the capability of the [[B-1 Lancer]] with live bombing activity over three bombing ranges on three continents in two hemispheres.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.naa.aero/html/awards/index.cfm?cmsid=186| title = Awards| publisher = National Aeronautic Association| accessdate = 2011-11-11 }}</ref> In the process, the team set three world records, flying 36,797.65 kilometers in 36 hours 13 minutes.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.targetlock.org.uk/b-1/service-part1.html |title=Squadron Service 1985-2001 |publisher=Targetlock |deadurl=no |accessdate=2013-09-02}}</ref>

Stewart cosponsored the [[Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2413; 113th Congress)]] and sponsored the substitute amendment which replaced the text of the original legislation. Stewart said the bill "prioritizes protection of public safety and forward-looking weather research, improves procurement of observing system data from space, air, and land, and opens up NOAA's process to encourage private sector weather solutions."<ref name=Stewartstatement>{{cite web|last=Stewart|first=Chris|title=Statement of Environment Subcommittee Chairman Chris Stewart|url=http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/images/HHRG-113-%20SY18-WState-S001192-20130709.pdf|publisher=Committee on Science, Space, and Technology|accessdate=31 March 2014|date=9 July 2013}}</ref>

Stewart is the sponsor of H.R. 1422, titled the "EPA Science Advisory Board Reform Act of 2014", which would reform the composition and activities of the [[Environmental Protection Agency]]'s (EPA) science advisory board. At least 10% of the members of the board would be required to be from state, local, or tribal governments. Corporate and industry experts would no longer be excluded from the board and board members would be prohibited from advising the EPA in discussions that cite their work. While the bill's supporters believe that it would increase transparency and balance in the EPA, critics argue that it "turns the idea of conflict of interest on its head" and would restrict scientists' ability to provide proper advice to the government.<ref>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|date=November 18, 2014|title=House passes bill to reform EPA science panel|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/224615-house-passes-bill-to-reform-epa-science-panel|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://democrats.science.house.gov/sites/democrats.science.house.gov/files/documents/Letter%20opposing%20EPA%20SAB%20Reform%20Act%20HR%201422%20.pdf|title=A letter from the Union of Concerned Scientists to the House of Representatives|date=November 17, 2014|publisher=[[Union of Concerned Scientists]]|accessdate=November 21, 2014}}</ref>

===Bureau of Land Management Issues===
In an interview regarding the [[Bundy standoff]] of April and May 2014, Stewart stated his opinion that the [[Bureau of Land Management]] could have avoided the standoff by allowing local sheriffs to intervene. Citing concerns about the level of weaponry carried by federal agents, he also sponsored a bill (H.R.4934) to demilitarize federal regulatory agencies.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Glionna|first1=John|title=BLM, local law enforcement tensions near breaking point in the West|url=http://www.latimes.com/nation/la-na-blm-critics-20140805-story.html|website=www.latimes.com|publisher=The Los Angeles Times|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.4934 - Regulatory Agency Demilitarization Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4934/text|accessdate=3 October 2014|date=June 23, 2014}}</ref>
