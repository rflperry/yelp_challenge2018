===U.S. House of Representatives===
Blackburn is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who identifies as a "congressman"; the others are Republicans [[Diane Black]] of Tennessee and [[Cynthia Lummis]] of Wyoming.<ref name=goby>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/06/meet_the_three_house_women_who.php |title=Meet the Three House Women Who Go by "Congressman" |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2002, Republican [[Ed Bryant]] gave up his seat as Representative from Tennessee's 7th District so that he could run for the Senate. Blackburn ran against Democrat Tim Barron for the seat and was overwhelmingly elected, thus becoming the first woman in Tennessee history to be elected to Congress without following her husband. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}In 2004 she ran unopposed and was re-elected.

In 2006, she successfully ran for a third term in the House of Representatives.<ref name=CM/> In November 2007, she ran for the position of Republican Conference chair, but lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9622.html |title=The lady prefers 'congressman' |work=Politico |first=HELENA |last=ANDREWS |date=Apr 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name=goby/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/01/07/marsha-blackburn-has-not-yet-decided-on-a-run-for-guv/ |title=Marsha Blackburn Has Not Yet Decided On A Run For Guv |author=Kleinheider |work=[[NashvillePost.com]] |date=January 7, 2009}}</ref> She joined [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] as a senior advisor.<ref>[http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Two_New_Senior_Advisers "Governor Mitt Romney Announces Two New Senior Advisers"]</ref> In May 2007, she resigned her position in the Romney campaign and endorsed former U.S. senator [[Fred Thompson]] for president.<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/politics/article/0,1426,MCA_1496_5555307,00.html "Blackburn endorses Fred Thompson"]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/politics/2012/blackburn-says-romney-victory-in-tn-wouldnt-surprise-her/ |title=Blackburn says Romney victory in TN wouldn’t surprise her |date=March 6, 2012 |author=Elizabeth Bewley |work=The Tennessean}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=TN senators back freeze on special spending

Though serving a national role as Vice Chair of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], Blackburn does not currently accept emails from outside of [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district]].

===Political campaigns===
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2013}}
[[gerrymandering|Redistricting]] after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] moved Blackburn's home from the 6th District into the 7th District.  The 6th District [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman, [[Bart Gordon]], had faced three tough races in the 1990s, including a near-defeat in 1994, seemingly due to the 6th's inclusion of Williamson County, the wealthiest county in the state and the most Republican county in Middle Tennessee. It appeared that the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly wanted to protect Gordon by moving Williamson County into the already heavily Republican 7th District.<ref>{{cite news |title=2011 Redistricting TN |date=2010-01-12 |work=TN Precinct Project |url=http://www.tnprecinctproject.com/2010/01/12/2011-redistricting-tn/ |first=KENT |last=DAVIS}}</ref> To maintain approximately equal district sizes (as required by [[Wesberry v. Sanders|Wesberry v. Sanders – 1964]]) and to compensate for the increase in 7th District population by the addition of Williamson County, the General Assembly shifted some of the more Democratic parts of [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] to the nearby 8th District. This created a district that is 200 miles long, but in some parts of Middle Tennessee is only two miles wide—roughly the width of a highway lane as depicted on a map. According to ''Memphis Magazine'', the [[gerrymander|gerrymandered district]] "stretches in reptilian fashion... from the suburbs of Memphis to those of western Nashville".<ref name=Baker/>
 
In 2002, 7th District incumbent Republican congressman [[Ed Bryant]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Fred Thompson]]. Blackburn entered the primary to replace Bryant. The party realignment from conservative Democratic, or "[[Dixiecrat]]ic," to Republican occurred largely due to conservative white reaction to 1960s developments such as [[Civil Rights]] and, among evangelical Christian residents particularly, the outlawing of [[school prayer]], as well as perceived attacks upon Southern white culture. Nearly all the rural counties, but also many Memphis and Nashville suburbanites hold a political worldview similar to the district's neighbors in places like [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]]. Despite the heavy presence of [[African Americans]] in some rural parts of the district east of Memphis, black political activity is nowhere as effective as that in Tennessee's two largest cities. Even if that were not the case, their numbers are insufficient to overcome the white majority.

Of the four serious candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing her to win the primary by 20 points. Her primary win was [[tantamount to election]] in November.  In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron.  She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. ([[Irene Baker|Irene Bailey Baker]] and [[Louise Reece]] had served as [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]s after their husbands died in office, and [[Marilyn Lloyd]] replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.)  She is also the first Republican to represent part of Nashville since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. A small portion of Nashville, roughly co-extensive with the Davidson County portion of the state senate district, was shifted from the heavily Democratic 5th District to the 7th District after the 2000 Census.

She ran unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'''s September 2004 [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/best-worst-of-congress/ "Best and Worst of Congress"], obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified her as one of the three best freshman members.  She has been reelected four more times with only nominal opposition.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the district more compact and suburban; it lost its shares of Nashville and Memphis.

=== Political positions ===
Blackburn is a fiscal and social conservative. She opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]], stating that with the passage of the bill, "freedom dies a little bit today."<ref name="nyt-healthcare">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Republicans Face Drawbacks of United Stand on Health Bill | first = Adam | last = Nagourney | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/politics/23repubs.html | date = March 22, 2010}}</ref> She subsequently supported efforts to repeal the legislation, arguing that it "means well" but fails to live up to its promise.<ref name="nyt-debate">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Approaching Civility (if Perhaps Falling Short of Eloquence) in Debate | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/us/politics/20civil.html | date = January 19, 2011}}</ref> When pressed by MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on the claim that the legislation included "[[death panel]]s" for the elderly, she would not reject this assertion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Kn14Yndy4 |title=Blackburn wont deny reform will create death panels |work=MSNBC |date=2009-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | title = 'Death panel' controversy remains very much alive | first = Peter | last = Grier | date = August 21, 2009 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0821/death-panel-controversy-remains-very-much-alive | quote = It [the "death panel" charge] has been widely debunked by fact-checking journalism organizations.}}</ref>

In April 2009, she questioned former Vice President [[Al Gore]] during an energy-related congressional hearing: "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something that you are going to personally benefit from?”.<ref>{{cite news |title=Al Gore 'profiting' from climate change agenda |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6496196/Al-Gore-profiting-from-climate-change-agenda.html |first=Nick |last=Allen |date=3 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'', a London-based periodical, has credited her for "famously put[ting Gore] on the spot about his business interests in the [energy] industry" during this confrontation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/al-gore-denies-he-is-carbon-billionaire-1814199.html |title=Al Gore denies he is 'carbon billionaire' |first=David |last=Usborne |date=4 November 2009 |work=The Independent}}</ref>  Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, pointing out that every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to a non-profit.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Azadeh | last = Ensha | url = http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/gore-to-blackburn-you-dont-know-me/ | title = Gore to Blackburn: 'You Don’t Know Me' | date = April 27, 2009}}</ref>

In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans which would criminalize all [[abortion]]s after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.<ref name="nyt-abortion">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = G.O.P.

At October 2013 congressional hearings on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "Obamacare", Blackburn charged that the health.gov website violated [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Privacy law#United States|health information privacy rights]]. The next day, when a [[CNN]] interviewer pointed out that the only health-related question that the web site asks is "do you smoke?", Blackburn repeated her criticism of the site for violating privacy rights.<ref>Cavendish, Steve [http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2013/10/25/this-is-what-happens-when-marsha-blackburn-cant-answer-a-simple-question ''This Is What Happens When Marsha Blackburn Can't Answer A Simple Question''], [[Nashville Scene]], 25 October 2013.

She scored 100% on [[American Conservative Union]]’s 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009 Ratings of Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2005all.htm#TN |title=2005 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2007all.htm#TN |title=2007 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://67.20.95.56/ratings/ratingsarchive/2009/House%20Ratings.htm |title=2009 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}}</ref> According to her campaign website, [[National Journal]] described her as a "freshman to watch" and a "top House conservative" in 2003 and 2004, [[Americans for Tax Reform]] called her a "taxpayer hero" in 2003, and the [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] praised her for supporting the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 2008, Blackburn was named one of the "Most Corrupt Members of Congress" by the government watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Bartholomew |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/sep/11/blackburn-added-to-most-corrupt-in-congress-list/ |title=Blackburn added to 'most corrupt' in Congress list |work=The Commercial Appeal |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> although the [[Federal Election Commission]] unanimously rejected CREW's complaint.<ref>"[http://m.knoxnews.com/news/2009/feb/16/fec-dismisses-finance-complaint-against-blackburn/ FEC Dismisses Complaint Against Blackburn]", [[Associated Press]] (February 16, 2009).</ref>

On February 16, 2014, Blackburn appeared on [[MSNBC]]'s ''Meet The Press'' as a guest in a [[climate change]] segment alongside [[Bill Nye]]. She reiterated a belief that scientists do not sufficiently understand the climate to make long term predictions, and argued that a cost/benefit analysis did not support taking any action against further carbon emission increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-feb-16-2014-n31691|title=MEET THE PRESS TRANSCRIPT|date=February 16, 2014|author=[[Gregory, David]]}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In April 2008, Blackburn summoned reporters to explain that she had found errors in her Federal Election Commission filings going back several years and had failed to report $286,278 in expenditures, including $18,821 to a fundraising consulting company run by her son-in-law, Paul Ketchel.  She also failed to report $102,044 in contributions.<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/group-names-us-rep-marsha-blackburn-its-most-corru</ref>

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Blackburn is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who identifies as a "congressman"; the others are Republicans [[Diane Black]] of Tennessee and [[Cynthia Lummis]] of Wyoming.<ref name=goby>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/06/meet_the_three_house_women_who.php |title=Meet the Three House Women Who Go by "Congressman" |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2002, Republican [[Ed Bryant]] gave up his seat as Representative from Tennessee's 7th District so that he could run for the Senate. Blackburn ran against Democrat Tim Barron for the seat and was overwhelmingly elected, thus becoming the first woman in Tennessee history to be elected to Congress without following her husband. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}In 2004 she ran unopposed and was re-elected.

In 2006, she successfully ran for a third term in the House of Representatives.<ref name=CM/> In November 2007, she ran for the position of Republican Conference chair, but lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9622.html |title=The lady prefers 'congressman' |work=Politico |first=HELENA |last=ANDREWS |date=Apr 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name=goby/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/01/07/marsha-blackburn-has-not-yet-decided-on-a-run-for-guv/ |title=Marsha Blackburn Has Not Yet Decided On A Run For Guv |author=Kleinheider |work=[[NashvillePost.com]] |date=January 7, 2009}}</ref> She joined [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] as a senior advisor.<ref>[http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Two_New_Senior_Advisers "Governor Mitt Romney Announces Two New Senior Advisers"]</ref> In May 2007, she resigned her position in the Romney campaign and endorsed former U.S. senator [[Fred Thompson]] for president.<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/politics/article/0,1426,MCA_1496_5555307,00.html "Blackburn endorses Fred Thompson"]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/politics/2012/blackburn-says-romney-victory-in-tn-wouldnt-surprise-her/ |title=Blackburn says Romney victory in TN wouldn’t surprise her |date=March 6, 2012 |author=Elizabeth Bewley |work=The Tennessean}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=TN senators back freeze on special spending

Though serving a national role as Vice Chair of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], Blackburn does not currently accept emails from outside of [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district]].

===Political campaigns===
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2013}}
[[gerrymandering|Redistricting]] after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] moved Blackburn's home from the 6th District into the 7th District.  The 6th District [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman, [[Bart Gordon]], had faced three tough races in the 1990s, including a near-defeat in 1994, seemingly due to the 6th's inclusion of Williamson County, the wealthiest county in the state and the most Republican county in Middle Tennessee. It appeared that the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly wanted to protect Gordon by moving Williamson County into the already heavily Republican 7th District.<ref>{{cite news |title=2011 Redistricting TN |date=2010-01-12 |work=TN Precinct Project |url=http://www.tnprecinctproject.com/2010/01/12/2011-redistricting-tn/ |first=KENT |last=DAVIS}}</ref> To maintain approximately equal district sizes (as required by [[Wesberry v. Sanders|Wesberry v. Sanders – 1964]]) and to compensate for the increase in 7th District population by the addition of Williamson County, the General Assembly shifted some of the more Democratic parts of [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] to the nearby 8th District. This created a district that is 200 miles long, but in some parts of Middle Tennessee is only two miles wide—roughly the width of a highway lane as depicted on a map. According to ''Memphis Magazine'', the [[gerrymander|gerrymandered district]] "stretches in reptilian fashion... from the suburbs of Memphis to those of western Nashville".<ref name=Baker/>
 
In 2002, 7th District incumbent Republican congressman [[Ed Bryant]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Fred Thompson]]. Blackburn entered the primary to replace Bryant. The party realignment from conservative Democratic, or "[[Dixiecrat]]ic," to Republican occurred largely due to conservative white reaction to 1960s developments such as [[Civil Rights]] and, among evangelical Christian residents particularly, the outlawing of [[school prayer]], as well as perceived attacks upon Southern white culture. Nearly all the rural counties, but also many Memphis and Nashville suburbanites hold a political worldview similar to the district's neighbors in places like [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]]. Despite the heavy presence of [[African Americans]] in some rural parts of the district east of Memphis, black political activity is nowhere as effective as that in Tennessee's two largest cities. Even if that were not the case, their numbers are insufficient to overcome the white majority.

Of the four serious candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing her to win the primary by 20 points. Her primary win was [[tantamount to election]] in November.  In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron.  She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. ([[Irene Baker|Irene Bailey Baker]] and [[Louise Reece]] had served as [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]s after their husbands died in office, and [[Marilyn Lloyd]] replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.)  She is also the first Republican to represent part of Nashville since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. A small portion of Nashville, roughly co-extensive with the Davidson County portion of the state senate district, was shifted from the heavily Democratic 5th District to the 7th District after the 2000 Census.

She ran unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'''s September 2004 [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/best-worst-of-congress/ "Best and Worst of Congress"], obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified her as one of the three best freshman members.  She has been reelected four more times with only nominal opposition.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the district more compact and suburban; it lost its shares of Nashville and Memphis.

=== Political positions ===
Blackburn is a fiscal and social conservative. She opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]], stating that with the passage of the bill, "freedom dies a little bit today."<ref name="nyt-healthcare">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Republicans Face Drawbacks of United Stand on Health Bill | first = Adam | last = Nagourney | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/politics/23repubs.html | date = March 22, 2010}}</ref> She subsequently supported efforts to repeal the legislation, arguing that it "means well" but fails to live up to its promise.<ref name="nyt-debate">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Approaching Civility (if Perhaps Falling Short of Eloquence) in Debate | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/us/politics/20civil.html | date = January 19, 2011}}</ref> When pressed by MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on the claim that the legislation included "[[death panel]]s" for the elderly, she would not reject this assertion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Kn14Yndy4 |title=Blackburn wont deny reform will create death panels |work=MSNBC |date=2009-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | title = 'Death panel' controversy remains very much alive | first = Peter | last = Grier | date = August 21, 2009 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0821/death-panel-controversy-remains-very-much-alive | quote = It [the "death panel" charge] has been widely debunked by fact-checking journalism organizations.}}</ref>

In April 2009, she questioned former Vice President [[Al Gore]] during an energy-related congressional hearing: "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something that you are going to personally benefit from?”.<ref>{{cite news |title=Al Gore 'profiting' from climate change agenda |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6496196/Al-Gore-profiting-from-climate-change-agenda.html |first=Nick |last=Allen |date=3 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'', a London-based periodical, has credited her for "famously put[ting Gore] on the spot about his business interests in the [energy] industry" during this confrontation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/al-gore-denies-he-is-carbon-billionaire-1814199.html |title=Al Gore denies he is 'carbon billionaire' |first=David |last=Usborne |date=4 November 2009 |work=The Independent}}</ref>  Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, pointing out that every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to a non-profit.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Azadeh | last = Ensha | url = http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/gore-to-blackburn-you-dont-know-me/ | title = Gore to Blackburn: 'You Don’t Know Me' | date = April 27, 2009}}</ref>

In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans which would criminalize all [[abortion]]s after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.<ref name="nyt-abortion">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = G.O.P.

At October 2013 congressional hearings on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "Obamacare", Blackburn charged that the health.gov website violated [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Privacy law#United States|health information privacy rights]]. The next day, when a [[CNN]] interviewer pointed out that the only health-related question that the web site asks is "do you smoke?", Blackburn repeated her criticism of the site for violating privacy rights.<ref>Cavendish, Steve [http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2013/10/25/this-is-what-happens-when-marsha-blackburn-cant-answer-a-simple-question ''This Is What Happens When Marsha Blackburn Can't Answer A Simple Question''], [[Nashville Scene]], 25 October 2013.

She scored 100% on [[American Conservative Union]]’s 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009 Ratings of Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2005all.htm#TN |title=2005 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2007all.htm#TN |title=2007 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://67.20.95.56/ratings/ratingsarchive/2009/House%20Ratings.htm |title=2009 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}}</ref> According to her campaign website, [[National Journal]] described her as a "freshman to watch" and a "top House conservative" in 2003 and 2004, [[Americans for Tax Reform]] called her a "taxpayer hero" in 2003, and the [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] praised her for supporting the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 2008, Blackburn was named one of the "Most Corrupt Members of Congress" by the government watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Bartholomew |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/sep/11/blackburn-added-to-most-corrupt-in-congress-list/ |title=Blackburn added to 'most corrupt' in Congress list |work=The Commercial Appeal |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> although the [[Federal Election Commission]] unanimously rejected CREW's complaint.<ref>"[http://m.knoxnews.com/news/2009/feb/16/fec-dismisses-finance-complaint-against-blackburn/ FEC Dismisses Complaint Against Blackburn]", [[Associated Press]] (February 16, 2009).</ref>

On February 16, 2014, Blackburn appeared on [[MSNBC]]'s ''Meet The Press'' as a guest in a [[climate change]] segment alongside [[Bill Nye]]. She reiterated a belief that scientists do not sufficiently understand the climate to make long term predictions, and argued that a cost/benefit analysis did not support taking any action against further carbon emission increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-feb-16-2014-n31691|title=MEET THE PRESS TRANSCRIPT|date=February 16, 2014|author=[[Gregory, David]]}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In April 2008, Blackburn summoned reporters to explain that she had found errors in her Federal Election Commission filings going back several years and had failed to report $286,278 in expenditures, including $18,821 to a fundraising consulting company run by her son-in-law, Paul Ketchel.  She also failed to report $102,044 in contributions.<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/group-names-us-rep-marsha-blackburn-its-most-corru</ref>

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Blackburn is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who identifies as a "congressman"; the others are Republicans [[Diane Black]] of Tennessee and [[Cynthia Lummis]] of Wyoming.<ref name=goby>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/06/meet_the_three_house_women_who.php |title=Meet the Three House Women Who Go by "Congressman" |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2002, Republican [[Ed Bryant]] gave up his seat as Representative from Tennessee's 7th District so that he could run for the Senate. Blackburn ran against Democrat Tim Barron for the seat and was overwhelmingly elected, thus becoming the first woman in Tennessee history to be elected to Congress without following her husband. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}In 2004 she ran unopposed and was re-elected.

In 2006, she successfully ran for a third term in the House of Representatives.<ref name=CM/> In November 2007, she ran for the position of Republican Conference chair, but lost.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0408/9622.html |title=The lady prefers 'congressman' |work=Politico |first=HELENA |last=ANDREWS |date=Apr 15, 2008}}</ref><ref name=goby/><ref>{{cite news |url=http://politics.nashvillepost.com/2009/01/07/marsha-blackburn-has-not-yet-decided-on-a-run-for-guv/ |title=Marsha Blackburn Has Not Yet Decided On A Run For Guv |author=Kleinheider |work=[[NashvillePost.com]] |date=January 7, 2009}}</ref> She joined [[Mitt Romney]]'s [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2008|presidential campaign]] as a senior advisor.<ref>[http://www.mittromney.com/News/Press-Releases/Two_New_Senior_Advisers "Governor Mitt Romney Announces Two New Senior Advisers"]</ref> In May 2007, she resigned her position in the Romney campaign and endorsed former U.S. senator [[Fred Thompson]] for president.<ref>[http://www.commercialappeal.com/mca/politics/article/0,1426,MCA_1496_5555307,00.html "Blackburn endorses Fred Thompson"]</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://blogs.tennessean.com/politics/2012/blackburn-says-romney-victory-in-tn-wouldnt-surprise-her/ |title=Blackburn says Romney victory in TN wouldn’t surprise her |date=March 6, 2012 |author=Elizabeth Bewley |work=The Tennessean}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=TN senators back freeze on special spending

Though serving a national role as Vice Chair of the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], Blackburn does not currently accept emails from outside of [[Tennessee's 7th congressional district]].

===Political campaigns===
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2013}}
[[gerrymandering|Redistricting]] after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] moved Blackburn's home from the 6th District into the 7th District.  The 6th District [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman, [[Bart Gordon]], had faced three tough races in the 1990s, including a near-defeat in 1994, seemingly due to the 6th's inclusion of Williamson County, the wealthiest county in the state and the most Republican county in Middle Tennessee. It appeared that the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly wanted to protect Gordon by moving Williamson County into the already heavily Republican 7th District.<ref>{{cite news |title=2011 Redistricting TN |date=2010-01-12 |work=TN Precinct Project |url=http://www.tnprecinctproject.com/2010/01/12/2011-redistricting-tn/ |first=KENT |last=DAVIS}}</ref> To maintain approximately equal district sizes (as required by [[Wesberry v. Sanders|Wesberry v. Sanders – 1964]]) and to compensate for the increase in 7th District population by the addition of Williamson County, the General Assembly shifted some of the more Democratic parts of [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] to the nearby 8th District. This created a district that is 200 miles long, but in some parts of Middle Tennessee is only two miles wide—roughly the width of a highway lane as depicted on a map. According to ''Memphis Magazine'', the [[gerrymander|gerrymandered district]] "stretches in reptilian fashion... from the suburbs of Memphis to those of western Nashville".<ref name=Baker/>
 
In 2002, 7th District incumbent Republican congressman [[Ed Bryant]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Fred Thompson]]. Blackburn entered the primary to replace Bryant. The party realignment from conservative Democratic, or "[[Dixiecrat]]ic," to Republican occurred largely due to conservative white reaction to 1960s developments such as [[Civil Rights]] and, among evangelical Christian residents particularly, the outlawing of [[school prayer]], as well as perceived attacks upon Southern white culture. Nearly all the rural counties, but also many Memphis and Nashville suburbanites hold a political worldview similar to the district's neighbors in places like [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]]. Despite the heavy presence of [[African Americans]] in some rural parts of the district east of Memphis, black political activity is nowhere as effective as that in Tennessee's two largest cities. Even if that were not the case, their numbers are insufficient to overcome the white majority.

Of the four serious candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing her to win the primary by 20 points. Her primary win was [[tantamount to election]] in November.  In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron.  She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. ([[Irene Baker|Irene Bailey Baker]] and [[Louise Reece]] had served as [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]s after their husbands died in office, and [[Marilyn Lloyd]] replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.)  She is also the first Republican to represent part of Nashville since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. A small portion of Nashville, roughly co-extensive with the Davidson County portion of the state senate district, was shifted from the heavily Democratic 5th District to the 7th District after the 2000 Census.

She ran unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'''s September 2004 [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/best-worst-of-congress/ "Best and Worst of Congress"], obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified her as one of the three best freshman members.  She has been reelected four more times with only nominal opposition.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the district more compact and suburban; it lost its shares of Nashville and Memphis.

=== Political positions ===
Blackburn is a fiscal and social conservative. She opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]], stating that with the passage of the bill, "freedom dies a little bit today."<ref name="nyt-healthcare">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Republicans Face Drawbacks of United Stand on Health Bill | first = Adam | last = Nagourney | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/politics/23repubs.html | date = March 22, 2010}}</ref> She subsequently supported efforts to repeal the legislation, arguing that it "means well" but fails to live up to its promise.<ref name="nyt-debate">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Approaching Civility (if Perhaps Falling Short of Eloquence) in Debate | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/us/politics/20civil.html | date = January 19, 2011}}</ref> When pressed by MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on the claim that the legislation included "[[death panel]]s" for the elderly, she would not reject this assertion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Kn14Yndy4 |title=Blackburn wont deny reform will create death panels |work=MSNBC |date=2009-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | title = 'Death panel' controversy remains very much alive | first = Peter | last = Grier | date = August 21, 2009 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0821/death-panel-controversy-remains-very-much-alive | quote = It [the "death panel" charge] has been widely debunked by fact-checking journalism organizations.}}</ref>

In April 2009, she questioned former Vice President [[Al Gore]] during an energy-related congressional hearing: "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something that you are going to personally benefit from?”.<ref>{{cite news |title=Al Gore 'profiting' from climate change agenda |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6496196/Al-Gore-profiting-from-climate-change-agenda.html |first=Nick |last=Allen |date=3 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'', a London-based periodical, has credited her for "famously put[ting Gore] on the spot about his business interests in the [energy] industry" during this confrontation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/al-gore-denies-he-is-carbon-billionaire-1814199.html |title=Al Gore denies he is 'carbon billionaire' |first=David |last=Usborne |date=4 November 2009 |work=The Independent}}</ref>  Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, pointing out that every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to a non-profit.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Azadeh | last = Ensha | url = http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/gore-to-blackburn-you-dont-know-me/ | title = Gore to Blackburn: 'You Don’t Know Me' | date = April 27, 2009}}</ref>

In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans which would criminalize all [[abortion]]s after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.<ref name="nyt-abortion">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = G.O.P.

At October 2013 congressional hearings on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "Obamacare", Blackburn charged that the health.gov website violated [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Privacy law#United States|health information privacy rights]].

On February 16, 2014, Blackburn appeared on [[MSNBC]]'s ''Meet The Press'' as a guest in a [[climate change]] segment alongside [[Bill Nye]]. She reiterated a belief that scientists do not sufficiently understand the climate to make long term predictions, and argued that a cost/benefit analysis did not support taking any action against further carbon emission increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-feb-16-2014-n31691|title=MEET THE PRESS TRANSCRIPT|date=February 16, 2014|author=[[Gregory, David]]}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In April 2008, Blackburn summoned reporters to explain that she had found errors in her Federal Election Commission filings going back several years and had failed to report $286,278 in expenditures, including $18,821 to a fundraising consulting company run by her son-in-law, Paul Ketchel.  She also failed to report $102,044 in contributions.<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/group-names-us-rep-marsha-blackburn-its-most-corru</ref>

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Blackburn is one of three female U.S. Representatives in Congress who identifies as a "congressman"; the others are Republicans [[Diane Black]] of Tennessee and [[Cynthia Lummis]] of Wyoming.<ref name=goby>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/06/meet_the_three_house_women_who.php |title=Meet the Three House Women Who Go by "Congressman" |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=June 13, 2013}}</ref>

In 2002, Republican [[Ed Bryant]] gave up his seat as Representative from Tennessee's 7th District so that he could run for the Senate. Blackburn ran against Democrat Tim Barron for the seat and was overwhelmingly elected, thus becoming the first woman in Tennessee history to be elected to Congress without following her husband. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}In 2004 she ran unopposed and was re-elected.

===Political campaigns===
{{BLP sources section|date=December 2013}}
[[gerrymandering|Redistricting]] after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] moved Blackburn's home from the 6th District into the 7th District.  The 6th District [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] Congressman, [[Bart Gordon]], had faced three tough races in the 1990s, including a near-defeat in 1994, seemingly due to the 6th's inclusion of Williamson County, the wealthiest county in the state and the most Republican county in Middle Tennessee. It appeared that the Democratic-controlled Tennessee General Assembly wanted to protect Gordon by moving Williamson County into the already heavily Republican 7th District.<ref>{{cite news |title=2011 Redistricting TN |date=2010-01-12 |work=TN Precinct Project |url=http://www.tnprecinctproject.com/2010/01/12/2011-redistricting-tn/ |first=KENT |last=DAVIS}}</ref> To maintain approximately equal district sizes (as required by [[Wesberry v. Sanders|Wesberry v. Sanders – 1964]]) and to compensate for the increase in 7th District population by the addition of Williamson County, the General Assembly shifted some of the more Democratic parts of [[Clarksville, Tennessee|Clarksville]] to the nearby 8th District. This created a district that is 200 miles long, but in some parts of Middle Tennessee is only two miles wide—roughly the width of a highway lane as depicted on a map. According to ''Memphis Magazine'', the [[gerrymander|gerrymandered district]] "stretches in reptilian fashion... from the suburbs of Memphis to those of western Nashville".<ref name=Baker/>
 
In 2002, 7th District incumbent Republican congressman [[Ed Bryant]] decided to run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Fred Thompson]]. Blackburn entered the primary to replace Bryant. The party realignment from conservative Democratic, or "[[Dixiecrat]]ic," to Republican occurred largely due to conservative white reaction to 1960s developments such as [[Civil Rights]] and, among evangelical Christian residents particularly, the outlawing of [[school prayer]], as well as perceived attacks upon Southern white culture. Nearly all the rural counties, but also many Memphis and Nashville suburbanites hold a political worldview similar to the district's neighbors in places like [[Mississippi]] and [[Alabama]]. Despite the heavy presence of [[African Americans]] in some rural parts of the district east of Memphis, black political activity is nowhere as effective as that in Tennessee's two largest cities. Even if that were not the case, their numbers are insufficient to overcome the white majority.

Of the four serious candidates, she was the only one from the Nashville suburbs, while the other three were all from Memphis and its suburbs. The three Memphians split the vote in that area, allowing her to win the primary by 20 points. Her primary win was [[tantamount to election]] in November.  In the general election, she defeated Democratic nominee Tim Barron.  She was the fourth woman elected to Congress from Tennessee, but the first not to serve as a stand-in for her husband. ([[Irene Baker|Irene Bailey Baker]] and [[Louise Reece]] had served as [[caretaker government#Caretakers|caretaker]]s after their husbands died in office, and [[Marilyn Lloyd]] replaced her husband on the ballot when he died after the primary election.)  She is also the first Republican to represent part of Nashville since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. A small portion of Nashville, roughly co-extensive with the Davidson County portion of the state senate district, was shifted from the heavily Democratic 5th District to the 7th District after the 2000 Census.

She ran unopposed for reelection in 2004, which is somewhat unusual for a freshman member of Congress, even from a district as heavily Republican as the 7th. ''[[Washingtonian (magazine)|Washingtonian]]'''s September 2004 [http://www.washingtonian.com/articles/people/best-worst-of-congress/ "Best and Worst of Congress"], obtained from a survey of Congressional aides, identified her as one of the three best freshman members.  She has been reelected four more times with only nominal opposition.  Redistricting after the 2010 census made the district more compact and suburban; it lost its shares of Nashville and Memphis.

=== Political positions ===
Blackburn is a fiscal and social conservative. She opposed the [[Affordable Care Act]], stating that with the passage of the bill, "freedom dies a little bit today."<ref name="nyt-healthcare">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Republicans Face Drawbacks of United Stand on Health Bill | first = Adam | last = Nagourney | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/23/us/politics/23repubs.html | date = March 22, 2010}}</ref> She subsequently supported efforts to repeal the legislation, arguing that it "means well" but fails to live up to its promise.<ref name="nyt-debate">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = Approaching Civility (if Perhaps Falling Short of Eloquence) in Debate | first = Jennifer | last = Steinhauer | url = http://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/20/us/politics/20civil.html | date = January 19, 2011}}</ref> When pressed by MSNBC's Joe Scarborough on the claim that the legislation included "[[death panel]]s" for the elderly, she would not reject this assertion.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=20Kn14Yndy4 |title=Blackburn wont deny reform will create death panels |work=MSNBC |date=2009-08-25}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | publisher = [[Christian Science Monitor]] | title = 'Death panel' controversy remains very much alive | first = Peter | last = Grier | date = August 21, 2009 | url = http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2009/0821/death-panel-controversy-remains-very-much-alive | quote = It [the "death panel" charge] has been widely debunked by fact-checking journalism organizations.}}</ref>

In April 2009, she questioned former Vice President [[Al Gore]] during an energy-related congressional hearing: "The legislation that we are discussing here today, is that something that you are going to personally benefit from?”.<ref>{{cite news |title=Al Gore 'profiting' from climate change agenda |url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/earth/environment/climatechange/6496196/Al-Gore-profiting-from-climate-change-agenda.html |first=Nick |last=Allen |date=3 November 2009 |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}</ref> ''[[The Independent]]'', a London-based periodical, has credited her for "famously put[ting Gore] on the spot about his business interests in the [energy] industry" during this confrontation.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/climate-change/al-gore-denies-he-is-carbon-billionaire-1814199.html |title=Al Gore denies he is 'carbon billionaire' |first=David |last=Usborne |date=4 November 2009 |work=The Independent}}</ref>  Gore vociferously refuted the implied accusation, pointing out that every penny he makes from renewable technology investment goes to a non-profit.<ref>{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | first = Azadeh | last = Ensha | url = http://green.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/gore-to-blackburn-you-dont-know-me/ | title = Gore to Blackburn: 'You Don’t Know Me' | date = April 27, 2009}}</ref>

In 2013, she was chosen to manage debate on a bill promoted by House Republicans which would criminalize all [[abortion]]s after 22 weeks' gestation, with limited exceptions for rape or incest.<ref name="nyt-abortion">{{cite news | work = [[New York Times]] | title = G.O.P.

At October 2013 congressional hearings on the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as "Obamacare", Blackburn charged that the health.gov website violated [[Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act|HIPAA]] and [[Privacy law#United States|health information privacy rights]]. The next day, when a [[CNN]] interviewer pointed out that the only health-related question that the web site asks is "do you smoke?", Blackburn repeated her criticism of the site for violating privacy rights.<ref>Cavendish, Steve [http://www.nashvillescene.com/pitw/archives/2013/10/25/this-is-what-happens-when-marsha-blackburn-cant-answer-a-simple-question ''This Is What Happens When Marsha Blackburn Can't Answer A Simple Question''], [[Nashville Scene]], 25 October 2013.

She scored 100% on [[American Conservative Union]]’s 2004, 2005, 2007, 2009 Ratings of Congress.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2005all.htm#TN |title=2005 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.acuratings.org/2007all.htm#TN |title=2007 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://67.20.95.56/ratings/ratingsarchive/2009/House%20Ratings.htm |title=2009 Votes by State Delegation |accessdate=2010-03-14 |work=ACU Ratings}}</ref> According to her campaign website, [[National Journal]] described her as a "freshman to watch" and a "top House conservative" in 2003 and 2004, [[Americans for Tax Reform]] called her a "taxpayer hero" in 2003, and the [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]] praised her for supporting the Medicare Prescription Drug and Modernization Act.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} In 2008, Blackburn was named one of the "Most Corrupt Members of Congress" by the government watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]],<ref>{{cite web|last=Sullivan |first=Bartholomew |url=http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/2008/sep/11/blackburn-added-to-most-corrupt-in-congress-list/ |title=Blackburn added to 'most corrupt' in Congress list |work=The Commercial Appeal |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> although the [[Federal Election Commission]] unanimously rejected CREW's complaint.<ref>"[http://m.knoxnews.com/news/2009/feb/16/fec-dismisses-finance-complaint-against-blackburn/ FEC Dismisses Complaint Against Blackburn]", [[Associated Press]] (February 16, 2009).</ref>

On February 16, 2014, Blackburn appeared on [[MSNBC]]'s ''Meet The Press'' as a guest in a [[climate change]] segment alongside [[Bill Nye]]. She reiterated a belief that scientists do not sufficiently understand the climate to make long term predictions, and argued that a cost/benefit analysis did not support taking any action against further carbon emission increases.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/meet-the-press/meet-press-transcript-feb-16-2014-n31691|title=MEET THE PRESS TRANSCRIPT|date=February 16, 2014|author=[[Gregory, David]]}}</ref>

===Controversy===
In April 2008, Blackburn summoned reporters to explain that she had found errors in her Federal Election Commission filings going back several years and had failed to report $286,278 in expenditures, including $18,821 to a fundraising consulting company run by her son-in-law, Paul Ketchel.  She also failed to report $102,044 in contributions.<ref>http://www.commercialappeal.com/news/local-news/group-names-us-rep-marsha-blackburn-its-most-corru</ref>
