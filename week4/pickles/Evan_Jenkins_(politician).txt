==2014 Congressional election==
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in West Virginia, 2014#District 3}}
In July 2013, Jenkins announced he was switching to the Republican Party in preparation for a run at [[West Virginia's 3rd congressional district]] seat, held by 19-term Democrat [[Nick Rahall]].  He had actually grown up as a Republican, but became a Democrat in 1992 prior to his run for the House of Delegates.  On switching parties, Jenkins stated that: “West Virginia is under attack from Barack Obama and a Democratic Party that our parents and grandparents would not recognize."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/democrat-switches-parties-to-challenge-rahall/|title=Democrat Switches Parties to Challenge Rahall #WV03|date=July 31, 2013|accessdate=July 31, 2013|work=[[Roll Call]]|first=Abby|last=Livingston}}</ref>  West Virginia's 3rd district had long been a Democratic stronghold, but had been swept up in the growing Republican tide that had swept the state since the turn of the century. In 2012, it went for [[Mitt Romney]] 66-32 percent, making it the second-most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democrat.<ref name=post/>  Jenkins and Rahall had contributed to each other's campaigns in the decade's previous election cycles.<ref name="Contributions">{{cite news | url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/News/statenews/201307290182 | title=Nick Rahall, Evan Jenkins contributed to each other's campaigns | work=[[Charleston Daily Mail]] | date=July 30, 2013 | accessdate=October 6, 2014 | author=Boucher, Dave}}</ref>

Jenkins ran unopposed in the Republican primary.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://pocahontastimes.com/beard-mclaughlin-win-primary-election/|title=Beard, McLaughlin win primary election|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>  He faced Rahall in the general election in November 2014.

The [[National Right to Life Committee]], West Virginia Chamber of Commerce, and West Virginians for Life, all of which had previously supported Rahall, supported Jenkins in 2014, and the [[West Virginia Coal Association]] endorsed Jenkins in September 2014.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huntingtonnews.net/95924|title=West Virginia Coal Association Endorses Evan Jenkins|work=Huntington News|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/article/20140916/DM0104/140919414|title=Charleston Daily Mail – Jenkins receives national pro-life endorsement|publisher=|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref>

As of September 18, 2014, the race was rated a "toss up" by both University of Virginia political professor [[Larry Sabato]], of [[Sabato's Crystal Ball]], and [[Stu Rothenberg]] of the Rothenberg Political Report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/article/20140918/dm01/140919211|title= NRA endorses Nick Rahall for Congress|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>  As of October 2, managing editor Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball said the race was still a toss-up, calling it "Super close, super expensive and super nasty."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2014/10/02/looking-into-the-crystal-ball/|title= Looking into the Crystal Ball|publisher=West Virginia Metro News|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/house|title=House Ratings|publisher= The Rothenberg Political Report|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>  Rahall outspent Jenkins in the election by a two-to-one ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterm-elections-2014-live-updates/story?id=26570502|title=Republicans Projected To Seize Control Of The Senate: 2014 Midterm Elections Results Live|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>

In the general election, Jenkins defeated Rahall, taking 55.3% of the vote to 44.7%--the second-largest margin of defeat suffered by an incumbent in the 2014 cycle. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/222908-rahall-loses-house-seat-in-west-virginia|title=Dem Rahall loses House seat after 38 years|author=Timothy Cama|work=TheHill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/west-virginia-elections|title=West Virginia Election Results|publisher=}}</ref>  As a measure of how Democratic much of this district once was, when Jenkins takes office on January 3, 2015, he will be the first Republican to represent what is now the 3rd since 1957 (the district was numbered as the 4th before 1993), and the first Republican to represent most of the district's southern portion since 1933 (most of which was the [[West Virginia's 5th congressional district|5th district]] before it was eliminated in 1973).<ref>{{cite book|title = The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress|last = Martis|first = Kenneth C.|authorlink =|coauthors =|year = 1989|publisher = Macmillan Publishing Company|location = New York|id =}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title = The Historical Atlas of United States Congressional Districts|last = Martis|first = Kenneth C.|authorlink =|coauthors =|year = 1982|publisher = Macmillan Publishing Company|location = New York|id =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp|title=Congressional Biographical Directory (CLERKWEB)|publisher=}}</ref> In addition Jenkins victory, along with those of [[Alex Mooney]] and [[David McKinley]] means that West Virginia will have an all Republican House delegation for the first time since 1923.

As of September 18, 2014, the race was rated a "toss up" by both University of Virginia political professor [[Larry Sabato]], of [[Sabato's Crystal Ball]], and [[Stu Rothenberg]] of the Rothenberg Political Report.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.charlestondailymail.com/article/20140918/dm01/140919211|title= NRA endorses Nick Rahall for Congress|publisher=Charleston Daily Mail|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>  As of October 2, managing editor Kyle Kondik of Sabato's Crystal Ball said the race was still a toss-up, calling it "Super close, super expensive and super nasty."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wvmetronews.com/2014/10/02/looking-into-the-crystal-ball/|title= Looking into the Crystal Ball|publisher=West Virginia Metro News|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://rothenbergpoliticalreport.com/ratings/house|title=House Ratings|publisher= The Rothenberg Political Report|accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>  Rahall outspent Jenkins in the election by a two-to-one ratio.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/midterm-elections-2014-live-updates/story?id=26570502|title=Republicans Projected To Seize Control Of The Senate: 2014 Midterm Elections Results Live|author=ABC News|work=ABC News}}</ref>

In the general election, Jenkins defeated Rahall, taking 55.3% of the vote to 44.7%--the second-largest margin of defeat suffered by an incumbent in the 2014 cycle. <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/222908-rahall-loses-house-seat-in-west-virginia|title=Dem Rahall loses House seat after 38 years|author=Timothy Cama|work=TheHill}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2014/west-virginia-elections|title=West Virginia Election Results|publisher=}}</ref>  As a measure of how Democratic much of this district once was, when Jenkins takes office on January 3, 2015, he will be the first Republican to represent what is now the 3rd since 1957 (the district was numbered as the 4th before 1993), and the first Republican to represent most of the district's southern portion since 1933 (most of which was the [[West Virginia's 5th congressional district|5th district]] before it was eliminated in 1973).<ref>{{cite book|title = The Historical Atlas of Political Parties in the United States Congress|last = Martis|first = Kenneth C.|authorlink =|coauthors =|year = 1989|publisher = Macmillan Publishing Company|location = New York|id =}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title = The Historical Atlas of United States Congressional Districts|last = Martis|first = Kenneth C.|authorlink =|coauthors =|year = 1982|publisher = Macmillan Publishing Company|location = New York|id =}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/biosearch/biosearch.asp|title=Congressional Biographical Directory (CLERKWEB)|publisher=}}</ref> In addition Jenkins victory, along with those of [[Alex Mooney]] and [[David McKinley]] means that West Virginia will have an all Republican House delegation for the first time since 1923.
