'''Nydia Margarita Velázquez''' (born March 28, 1953) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] since 1993.

Her district, located in [[New York City]], was numbered the {{ushr|NY|12|12th district}} from 1993 to 2013 and has been numbered the {{ushr|NY|7|7th district}} since 2013.

==Early life, education and career==
Velázquez, whose father worked the [[sugar cane]] fields, was one of nine siblings born in [[Yabucoa, Puerto Rico]]. During her upbringing, political dinner conversations were commonplace. Her father was a local political activist and she would accompany him to political rallies, starting at a young age. Her father focused on the rights of sugar cane workers and denounced the abuses of wealthy farmers.<ref name="HAC">[http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/congress/velazquez.html Hispanic Americans in Congress]</ref>

After skipping a grade, she entered high school when she was 13. While a student, she organized a protest to draw attention to the school's dangerous and unsanitary conditions. The protest resulted in the school temporarily closing down so that the necessary renovations could be made.

At age 16, Velázquez enrolled in the [[University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras Campus|University of Puerto Rico, Río Piedras]]. In 1974, she graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' and became the first member of her family to receive a college degree. She then went to New York City to attend [[New York University]], where she received a scholarship to study [[political science]]. In 1976, she received her [[Master's degree]].<ref name="HAC"/>

Velázquez was a professor, first at the [[University of Puerto Rico at Humacao]] from 1976 to 1981, and then at New York's [[Hunter College]] from 1981 until 1983.<ref name="HAC"/>

Throughout her career, Velázquez has been an advocate of many Latino rights programs and associations.  During her tenure as the Director of the Department of Puerto Rican Community Affairs in the United States, Velázquez initiated one of the most successful Latino empowerment programs in the nation’s history - "Atrévete" (Dare to Go for It!).  She taught Puerto Rican Studies at [[Hunter College]] and became the first Latina woman to serve on the New York City Council.

==New York City Council==
In 1983, Velázquez was appointed Special Assistant to Representative [[Edolphus Towns]] ([[United States Democratic Party|D]]-[[Brooklyn]]). In 1984, she became the first [[Latino|Latina]] appointed to serve as a member of the [[New York City Council]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
Velázquez has represented a progressive shift in the House. Although some thought that she would be facing a political decline due to factors such as "the redrawing of the district's boundaries in 1997 to include fewer Latinos, and the gradual decline of the Puerto Rican population in New York," she has persevered. As reasoning, commentators have suggested "her ability to forge alliances at home and in the House".<ref name="Velasquez Washington Post Bio">{{cite news|title=Nydia M.

===Controversy===
Velazquez has been criticized by her primary opponents [[Jeff Kurzon]] for her close ties to the banking industry and her reluctance to support reform and transparency measures. A majority of her campaign contributions have come from banks, including [[Goldman Sachs]] and the American Bankers Association.<ref name="opensecrets.org"/> Opponents have suggested that these contributions influenced her votes in support of the bailouts and her votes against reform and transparency measures.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/nyregion/velazquez-and-dilan-clash-in-debate-among-four-seeking-house-seat.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sarah | last=Wheaton | title=Velázquez and Dilan Clash in Debate Among Four Seeking House Seat | date=June 22, 2012}}</ref>  In addition to support for private banks, Ms. Velazquez voted against bi-partisan House efforts to audit the federal reserve, both in 2009 and in 2012.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h513</ref>

In 2012, Congresswoman Velazquez was named by the American Small Business League (ASBL) as the most anti-small business member of the U.S. House of Representatives.  The ASBL points to the fact that Rep. Velazquez  blocked legislation, including H.R. 3184, “The Fairness and Transparency in Contracting Act," that would prevent large corporations from claiming billions of dollars worth of federal contracts reserved for small businesses.  ASBL claims that Velazquez also voted to divert billions in federal contract dollars earmarked for small businesses to firms such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BlackWater and Italian defense firm Finmeccanica.<ref>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nydia-velazquez-sam-graves-named-070100387.html</ref>

===Controversy===
Velazquez has been criticized by her primary opponents [[Jeff Kurzon]] for her close ties to the banking industry and her reluctance to support reform and transparency measures. A majority of her campaign contributions have come from banks, including [[Goldman Sachs]] and the American Bankers Association.<ref name="opensecrets.org"/> Opponents have suggested that these contributions influenced her votes in support of the bailouts and her votes against reform and transparency measures.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/23/nyregion/velazquez-and-dilan-clash-in-debate-among-four-seeking-house-seat.html | work=The New York Times | first=Sarah | last=Wheaton | title=Velázquez and Dilan Clash in Debate Among Four Seeking House Seat | date=June 22, 2012}}</ref>  In addition to support for private banks, Ms. Velazquez voted against bi-partisan House efforts to audit the federal reserve, both in 2009 and in 2012.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2012/h513</ref>

In 2012, Congresswoman Velazquez was named by the American Small Business League (ASBL) as the most anti-small business member of the U.S. House of Representatives.  The ASBL points to the fact that Rep. Velazquez  blocked legislation, including H.R. 3184, “The Fairness and Transparency in Contracting Act," that would prevent large corporations from claiming billions of dollars worth of federal contracts reserved for small businesses.  ASBL claims that Velazquez also voted to divert billions in federal contract dollars earmarked for small businesses to firms such as Lockheed Martin, Boeing, BlackWater and Italian defense firm Finmeccanica.<ref>http://finance.yahoo.com/news/nydia-velazquez-sam-graves-named-070100387.html</ref>
