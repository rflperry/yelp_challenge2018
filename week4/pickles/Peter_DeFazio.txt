'''Peter Anthony DeFazio''' (born May 27, 1947) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OR|4}}, serving since 1987. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district includes [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]], [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] and part of [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]].

A native of [[Massachusetts]] and a veteran of the [[United States Air Force]], he previously served as a county commissioner in [[Lane County, Oregon]].

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
DeFazio was born in [[Needham, Massachusetts]] in 1947,<ref name="cong"/> a suburb of [[Boston]].<ref name="cong"/>  He credits his great-uncle with shaping his politics; as a boy, that great-uncle almost never said "Republican" without including "bastard" at the end (or "bastud," as it usually sounds in the [[Boston accent]]).<ref name=DeFazioBio>{{Wayback |date=20030205032020 |url=defazioforcongress.org/biography.htm |title=Biography page at archive of DeFazio campaign site}}.</ref> He served in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1967 to 1971.<ref name="votesmart">[http://www.vote-smart.org/bio.php?can_id=H3341103 DeFazio's profile] from [[Project Vote Smart]]</ref> He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Tufts University]] in 1969<ref name="cong"/> and a [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1977.<ref name="cong"/>

After graduation, DeFazio worked as a [[gerontology|gerontologist]]. From 1977 to 1982, DeFazio worked as an aide for U.S. Representative [[James H. Weaver|Jim Weaver]].<ref name="cong">[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=d000191 DeFazio's biography] in the ''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]''</ref> He was elected as a [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] Commissioner in 1983 and served as chairman from 1985 to 1986.<ref name="cong"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1986, DeFazio ran for [[Oregon's 4th congressional district]], vacated by retiring [[incumbent]] Democratic congressman [[Jim Weaver (Oregon politician)|Jim Weaver]].<ref name="cong"/> DeFazio narrowly won in a competitive three-way primary against State Senators [[Bill Bradbury]] and [[Margie Hendriksen]] 34%-33%-31%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=749083</ref> He won the general election with 54% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52177</ref>

He didn't face another contest nearly that close until 2010, winning every election before then with at least 61 percent of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1616</ref> He has forged a nearly unbreakable hold on a district which is only marginally Democratic on paper; it narrowly voted for [[George W. Bush]] in 2000 and [[John Kerry]] in 2004.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008#Fourth congressional district}}
DeFazio won 82% of the vote over two minor party candidates.

Earlier, he reportedly considered and re-considered running against Smith for the [[Oregon United States Senate election, 2008|2008 Senate election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

After [[Barack Obama]] was elected president in 2008, it was reported that DeFazio was under consideration for nomination as Obama's [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transportation's Obama Factor|url=http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=48725}}</ref> However, fellow U.S. Representative [[Ray LaHood]] was named to the post in December 2008.

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2010#District4}}
In 2010, DeFazio was challenged by Republican [[Arthur B. Robinson|Art Robinson]] and Pacific Green candidate Michael Beilstein. As a result of the [[SCOTUS]] decision on [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]], a so-called [[Political action committee|Super PAC]] group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $300,000 for ads attacking De Fazio and $150,000 for ads attacking [[Frank Kratovil]] of [[Maryland]]. It was not revealed until the mid-October 2010 quarterly [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] filings that the group was solely funded by $300,000 from Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]], and $200,000 from New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of [[Setauket, New York]]. The FEC filings prior to then listed only a Capitol Hill address and Republican political consultant Jason Miller as treasurer. According to [[Dan Eggen]] at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the group claims "it was formed in September 'to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation' in the fight against 'runaway spending.'" The only expenditures have been for these ads.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092406094.html DeFazio tries to find out who is behind mysterious attack ads], Karen Tumulty, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 25, 2010</ref><ref>[http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2010/10/wealthy_financier_is_mysteriou.html Wealthy financier is mysterious funder of ads attacking DeFazio], Jeff Mapes, ''[[The Oregonian]]'', October 15, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/16/AR2010101603822.html Concerned Taxpayers group is powered by only two donors], [[Dan Eggen]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 17, 2010</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703494404575082000779302566.html Pioneering Fund Stages Second Act], Scott Patterson and Jenny Strasburg, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', March 16, 2010</ref>

DeFazio won with 54% of the vote, his lowest winning percentage since he was first elected in 1986.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=510934</ref> ''The Oregonian'' noted that the reelection of DeFazio to his 13th term was more notable for the amount of outside money spent on the campaign than the candidates themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/ oregon_election_results_us_hou_1.html|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/oregon_election_results_us_hou_1.html|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=18 April 2012|author=Charles Pope|date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2012#District 4}}
In September 2011, the National Journal cited DeFazio as an example of “swing-district Democrats seeking reelection in 2012," and who, in “begin[ning] to focus on their reelection bids after Labor Day...are increasingly calculating how close is too close to an unpopular President Obama.”  It also noted that DeFazio's district “nearly went for Republican George W. Bush in 2004."<ref>{{cite web|title=Democrats Distancing Themselves From Obama|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/democrats-distancing-themselves-from-obama-20110901|publisher=National Journal|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Alex Roarty and Beth Reinhard|date=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

===Tenure===
[[File:PeterDeFazio.jpg|thumb|left|Peter DeFazio]]DeFazio has a progressive voting record. He voted against the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]—one of only 16 congressmen to do so.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml</ref> DeFazio particularly objected to a provision that deregulated the cable television industry.  According to DeFazio, many of his fellow Democratic congressmen later realized "they were idiots" for backing the bill.  He was also the only Oregonian who voted against both [[NAFTA]] and [[GATT]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll575.xml</ref><ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll507.xml</ref> In 1995, he challenged President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton']]s stance on Bosnia, claiming Clinton and his Cabinet did not make a convincing claim for the operation. On the issue of abortion, DeFazio is strongly pro-choice, earning a 100 percent rating from [[Planned Parenthood]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27037]</ref><ref>http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2010-congressional-record.pdf</ref>  He is a founding member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], and was its chairman from 2003 to 2005.

DeFazio has shown a propensity to vote against legislation that would increase the militarism of the United States. In 2000, he voted no on legislation to create a [[national missile defense]] network, describing the system as a "comic book fantasy."<ref>{{cite web|title=US Unfazed By Putin Comments On ABM|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/bmdo-00zzo.html|publisher=Space Daily|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=July 18, 2000}}</ref> He has consistently voted against the [[Patriot Act]], including its inception after 9/11 and the recurring reauthorization bills, citing the infringement on the civil rights of Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=On Patriot Act, Congress lifts its own gag order|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/index.ssf/2011/02/on_patriot_act_congress_lifts.html|publisher=The Oregonion|accessdate=18 May 2012|author=David Sarasohn|date=February 10, 2011}}</ref> He voted multiple times to set an itinerary for exiting Iraq, and to bring the troops home.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oregon Lawmakers Sound Off on President's New Plan For Iraq|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/january112007/senators_011107.php|publisher=Salem News|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=Jan 11, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Peter defazio.jpeg|thumb|Rep. DeFazio]]In 2008, DeFazio and California Representative [[Pete Stark]] signed a letter to House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] proposing a one quarter of one percent transaction tax on all trades in financial instruments, including stocks, options, and futures. Subsequently, DeFazio introduced the "No BAILOUT Act."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-progressives-propose-bailout-alternative|title = The "No BAILOUTS Act"|date = 30 September 2008|accessdate = 20 June 2008|website = The Nation|publisher = |last = Nichols|first = John}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-progressives-propose-bailout-alternative|title = House Progressives Propose Bailout Alternative|date = 30 Sep 2008|accessdate = 20 June 2014|website = The Nation|publisher = |last = Hayes|first = Christopher}}</ref>

Somewhat controversially, DeFazio declined to support the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], voting against the final stimulus package on February 13, 2009. He was one of only seven Democratic House members to vote "nay" on the bill.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll070.xml</ref><ref>[http://thepage.time.com/democrats-not-supporting-the-stimulus/ Democrats Not Supporting the Stimulus]</ref> DeFazio said that his vote against the bill was due to his frustration over compromises made to win support from moderate Republicans in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], saying, "I couldn't justify borrowing money for tax cuts," in reference to a bipartisan group's decision to cut funding for education and infrastructure initiatives the Oregon congressman had supported in favor of more tax reductions.<ref>[http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/02/the-progressive-gadfly-defazio-explains-his-no-on-stimulus.php The Progressive Gadfly: DeFazio Explains His 'No' on Stimulus]</ref> He also advocated that the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] change its [[cloture]] rules, doing away with the filibuster that, in the current 59–41 Democratic majority, gives Republicans the ability to block legislation from coming to a vote.<ref>{{cite news

DeFazio, speaking to press after the exchange, professed that he was honored that Obama recognized him and the issues of his constituents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2009/03/defazio_gets_obama_jibe_on_sti.html|title=DeFazio gets Obama jibe on stimulus vote|agency=''The Oregonian''|first=Jeff|last=Mapes|date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>

DeFazio made headlines in mid-November 2009 when he suggested in an interview with [[MSNBC]] commentator [[Ed Schultz]] that President Obama should fire [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]] and [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council Director]] [[Lawrence Summers]]. "We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get back millions for Americans," said DeFazio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/18/rep-defazio-fire-timmy-ge_n_363093.html|agency=''The Huffington Post'' and MSNBC|title=Rep.

A year later he called for the impeachment of Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] because of the Supreme Court ruling on [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]].

In 2009, DeFazio proposed a [[financial transaction tax]] for within the [[United States]] only (not internationally).<ref name="calls for">{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/12/defazio_calls_for_tax_on_high.html|title=DeFazio calls for tax on financial transactions but critics abound |author=Charles Pope |date=December 2009 |work= |publisher= [[The Oregonian]], OregonLive.com|accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> (See [[DeFazio financial transaction tax]].)

During his tenure, DeFazio has butted heads with fellow Democratic politicians, including President [[Barack Obama]], on key Democratic legislation. In December 2010, DeFazio told CNN that “The White House is putting on tremendous pressure” about legislation extending the [[Bush tax cuts]], “the president is making phone calls saying this is the end of his presidency if he doesn't get this bad deal.” According to The Hill, "The president hasn’t said anything remotely like that and has never spoken with Mr. DeFazio about the issue," said White House spokesman [[Tommy Vietor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama tells lawmakers not passing tax deal could end presidency, Dem says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/133909-obama-tells-lawmakers-notpassing-tax-deal-could-end-presidency-dem-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Jordan Fabian|date=12/15/10}}</ref> In August 2011, Defazio stated the President lacked the fight to follow-through in restoring the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, citing the pressure placed on him by the Republicans as the reason.<ref>{{cite web|title=DeFazio says Obama lacks will to fight, may lose Oregon|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Democratic-Oregon-Congressman-Rips-into-President-128046958.html|publisher=Channel 8 News, Portland Oregon|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Pat Dooris|date=August 19, 2011}}</ref> DeFazio, along with fellow congressman Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bernie Sanders, stated that it would be good for the Democratic party if the president faced a meaningful primary, where all the issues would be aired out.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Hampshire Results Point to a Notable Democratic Enthusiasm Gap|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/165602/new-hampshire-results-point-notable-democratic-enthusiasm-gap|publisher=TheNaiton.com|accessdate=15 June 2012|author=John Nichols|date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

In October 2011, [[Think Progress]] noted that DeFazio, “Echoing the demands of the Occupy Wall Street protesters,...is proposing to tax the trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives. DeFazio, along with his Senate co-sponsor Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), has proposed the tax several times in the past. But this time around, the idea is getting a boost of momentum from the popularity of a similar measure in Europe, as well as renewed national media focus on Wall Street profiteering as a result of the 99 Percent Movement.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling Wall Street A ‘Gambling Casino,’ Democratic Rep.

Also in October 2011, the [[Daily Caller]] used DeFazio as an example of the increase in “institutional support” being enjoyed by the Occupy movement.  Speaking on the House floor, DeFazio said, “Something is happening. Something in this land is happening. I call it the 'American Awakening.'”  He added that “I think the young people and the others who are joining them on Wall Street get it. They may not be totally focused, but they know that this is not a country that gives them a fair shot at the American dream anymore — it is a stacked deck.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Dems rally in support of ‘Occupy Wall Street’|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/06/congressional-dems-rally-in-support-of-occupy-wallstreet/|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=26 June 2012|author=Caroline May|date=10/06/2011}}</ref>

DeFazio opposed the [[Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].<ref name=cbo4899>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4899|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr4899.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.<ref name="HousePassesMarcos"/><ref name="GraeberUPI"/> DeFazio argued that the bill did not solve the true cause of high gas prices which he blamed on "Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street."<ref name=HousePassesMarcos>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to increase offshore energy projects|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/210690-house-passes-bill-to-increase-offshore-energy-projects|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=26 June 2014}}</ref> DeFazio called the bill the "drill everywhere" bill.<ref name=GraeberUPI>{{cite news|last1=Graeber|first1=Daniel J.|title=House measure on gas aimed at lower prices|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/06/27/House-measure-on-gas-aimed-at-lower-prices/9031403872288/|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=UPI|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

[[File:Peter DeFazio, official Congressional photo portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Early official portrait of Peter DeFazio.]]

===1995===
After Senator [[Bob Packwood]] resigned in early September 1995, DeFazio ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the [[United States Senate]] in a [[By-election|special primary]], losing to 3rd District Congressman [[Ron Wyden]]. Wyden started out with clear advantages over DeFazio; more seniority, a base in the large [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] media market and more cash on hand in his campaign committee.  However, DeFazio's scrappy campaign style, underscored by his TV ads featuring his populist musings while driving in his [[Dodge Dart]], made him a favorite among many Democratic activists.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  Ultimately, DeFazio lost to Wyden by only 6% in the Democratic primary,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&year=1995&f=0&off=3&elect=7|title = 1995 Senatorial Special Election Results - Oregon|date = 5 Jan 2007|accessdate = June 21, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> despite his early lead of 20%.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Wyden, bruised by the primary and trailing State Senator [[Gordon H. Smith]], managed to pull off an upset against Smith in the [[United States Senate special election in Oregon, 1996|January 1996 special election]].

===1996===
DeFazio had been mentioned to run for the seat of Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], who announced after the special primary election that he would not seek re-election in 1996. However, faced with the prospect of having to take on well-funded millionaires in both the primary and general election, DeFazio announced in February 1996 that he would not run.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Personal life ==
DeFazio is a member of the [[Catholicism and American politics|Roman Catholic Church]]. He and his wife, Myrnie Daut,<ref name="votesmart"/> reside in [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]].

'''Peter Anthony DeFazio''' (born May 27, 1947) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OR|4}}, serving since 1987. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district includes [[Eugene, Oregon|Eugene]], [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]], [[Roseburg, Oregon|Roseburg]] and part of [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]]. As Oregon's most senior member of Congress, he is the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives|dean]] of Oregon's House of Representatives delegation. A native of [[Massachusetts]] and a veteran of the [[United States Air Force]], he previously served as a county commissioner in [[Lane County, Oregon]].

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
DeFazio was born in [[Needham, Massachusetts]] in 1947,<ref name="cong"/> a suburb of [[Boston]].<ref name="cong"/>  He credits his great-uncle with shaping his politics; as a boy, that great-uncle almost never said "Republican" without including "bastard" at the end (or "bastud," as it usually sounds in the [[Boston accent]]).<ref name=DeFazioBio>{{Wayback |date=20030205032020 |url=defazioforcongress.org/biography.htm |title=Biography page at archive of DeFazio campaign site}}.</ref> He served in the [[United States Air Force]] from 1967 to 1971.<ref name="votesmart">[http://www.vote-smart.org/bio.php?can_id=H3341103 DeFazio's profile] from [[Project Vote Smart]]</ref> He received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Tufts University]] in 1969<ref name="cong"/> and a [[Master's degree|Master of Arts]] degree from the [[University of Oregon]] in 1977.<ref name="cong"/>

After graduation, DeFazio worked as a [[gerontology|gerontologist]]. From 1977 to 1982, DeFazio worked as an aide for U.S. Representative [[James H. Weaver|Jim Weaver]].<ref name="cong">[http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=d000191 DeFazio's biography] in the ''[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]]''</ref> He was elected as a [[Lane County, Oregon|Lane County]] Commissioner in 1983 and served as chairman from 1985 to 1986.<ref name="cong"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1986, DeFazio ran for [[Oregon's 4th congressional district]], vacated by retiring [[incumbent]] Democratic congressman [[Jim Weaver (Oregon politician)|Jim Weaver]].<ref name="cong"/> DeFazio narrowly won in a competitive three-way primary against State Senators [[Bill Bradbury]] and [[Margie Hendriksen]] 34%-33%-31%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=749083</ref> He won the general election with 54% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52177</ref>

He didn't face another contest nearly that close until 2010, winning every election before then with at least 61 percent of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1616</ref> He has forged a nearly unbreakable hold on a district which is only marginally Democratic on paper; it narrowly voted for [[George W. Bush]] in 2000 and [[John Kerry]] in 2004.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008#Fourth congressional district}}
DeFazio won 82% of the vote over two minor party candidates.

Earlier, he reportedly considered and re-considered running against Smith for the [[Oregon United States Senate election, 2008|2008 Senate election]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

After [[Barack Obama]] was elected president in 2008, it was reported that DeFazio was under consideration for nomination as Obama's [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transportation's Obama Factor|url=http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=48725}}</ref> However, fellow U.S. Representative [[Ray LaHood]] was named to the post in December 2008.

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2010#District4}}
In 2010, DeFazio was challenged by Republican [[Arthur B. Robinson|Art Robinson]] and Pacific Green candidate Michael Beilstein. As a result of the [[SCOTUS]] decision on [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]], a so-called [[Political action committee|Super PAC]] group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $300,000 for ads attacking De Fazio and $150,000 for ads attacking [[Frank Kratovil]] of [[Maryland]]. It was not revealed until the mid-October 2010 quarterly [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] filings that the group was solely funded by $300,000 from Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]], and $200,000 from New York hedge fund executive Robert Mercer, the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of [[Setauket, New York]]. The FEC filings prior to then listed only a Capitol Hill address and Republican political consultant Jason Miller as treasurer. According to [[Dan Eggen]] at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the group claims "it was formed in September 'to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation' in the fight against 'runaway spending.'" The only expenditures have been for these ads.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092406094.html DeFazio tries to find out who is behind mysterious attack ads], Karen Tumulty, ''[[The Washington Post]]'', September 25, 2010</ref><ref>[http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2010/10/wealthy_financier_is_mysteriou.html Wealthy financier is mysterious funder of ads attacking DeFazio], Jeff Mapes, ''[[The Oregonian]]'', October 15, 2010</ref><ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/16/AR2010101603822.html Concerned Taxpayers group is powered by only two donors], [[Dan Eggen]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 17, 2010</ref><ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703494404575082000779302566.html Pioneering Fund Stages Second Act], Scott Patterson and Jenny Strasburg, ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', March 16, 2010</ref>

DeFazio won with 54% of the vote, his lowest winning percentage since he was first elected in 1986.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=510934</ref> ''The Oregonian'' noted that the reelection of DeFazio to his 13th term was more notable for the amount of outside money spent on the campaign than the candidates themselves.<ref>{{cite web|title=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/ oregon_election_results_us_hou_1.html|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/oregon_election_results_us_hou_1.html|publisher=The Oregonian|accessdate=18 April 2012|author=Charles Pope|date=November 2, 2010}}</ref>

;2012
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2012#District 4}}
In September 2011, the National Journal cited DeFazio as an example of “swing-district Democrats seeking reelection in 2012," and who, in “begin[ning] to focus on their reelection bids after Labor Day...are increasingly calculating how close is too close to an unpopular President Obama.”  It also noted that DeFazio's district “nearly went for Republican George W. Bush in 2004."<ref>{{cite web|title=Democrats Distancing Themselves From Obama|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/democrats-distancing-themselves-from-obama-20110901|publisher=National Journal|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Alex Roarty and Beth Reinhard|date=September 1, 2011}}</ref>

===Tenure===
[[File:PeterDeFazio.jpg|thumb|left|Peter DeFazio]]DeFazio has a progressive voting record. He voted against the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]—one of only 16 congressmen to do so.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml</ref> DeFazio particularly objected to a provision that deregulated the cable television industry.  According to DeFazio, many of his fellow Democratic congressmen later realized "they were idiots" for backing the bill.  He was also the only Oregonian who voted against both [[NAFTA]] and [[GATT]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll575.xml</ref><ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll507.xml</ref> In 1995, he challenged President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton']]s stance on Bosnia, claiming Clinton and his Cabinet did not make a convincing claim for the operation. On the issue of abortion, DeFazio is strongly pro-choice, earning a 100 percent rating from [[Planned Parenthood]] in 2010.<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27037]</ref><ref>http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2010-congressional-record.pdf</ref>  He is a founding member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], and was its chairman from 2003 to 2005.

DeFazio has shown a propensity to vote against legislation that would increase the militarism of the United States. In 2000, he voted no on legislation to create a [[national missile defense]] network, describing the system as a "comic book fantasy."<ref>{{cite web|title=US Unfazed By Putin Comments On ABM|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/bmdo-00zzo.html|publisher=Space Daily|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=July 18, 2000}}</ref> He has consistently voted against the [[Patriot Act]], including its inception after 9/11 and the recurring reauthorization bills, citing the infringement on the civil rights of Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=On Patriot Act, Congress lifts its own gag order|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/index.ssf/2011/02/on_patriot_act_congress_lifts.html|publisher=The Oregonion|accessdate=18 May 2012|author=David Sarasohn|date=February 10, 2011}}</ref> He voted multiple times to set an itinerary for exiting Iraq, and to bring the troops home.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oregon Lawmakers Sound Off on President's New Plan For Iraq|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/january112007/senators_011107.php|publisher=Salem News|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=Jan 11, 2007}}</ref>

[[File:Peter defazio.jpeg|thumb|Rep. DeFazio]]In 2008, DeFazio and California Representative [[Pete Stark]] signed a letter to House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] proposing a one quarter of one percent transaction tax on all trades in financial instruments, including stocks, options, and futures. Subsequently, DeFazio introduced the "No BAILOUT Act."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-progressives-propose-bailout-alternative|title = The "No BAILOUTS Act"|date = 30 September 2008|accessdate = 20 June 2008|website = The Nation|publisher = |last = Nichols|first = John}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-progressives-propose-bailout-alternative|title = House Progressives Propose Bailout Alternative|date = 30 Sep 2008|accessdate = 20 June 2014|website = The Nation|publisher = |last = Hayes|first = Christopher}}</ref>

Somewhat controversially, DeFazio declined to support the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], voting against the final stimulus package on February 13, 2009. He was one of only seven Democratic House members to vote "nay" on the bill.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll070.xml</ref><ref>[http://thepage.time.com/democrats-not-supporting-the-stimulus/ Democrats Not Supporting the Stimulus]</ref> DeFazio said that his vote against the bill was due to his frustration over compromises made to win support from moderate Republicans in the [[United States Senate|Senate]], saying, "I couldn't justify borrowing money for tax cuts," in reference to a bipartisan group's decision to cut funding for education and infrastructure initiatives the Oregon congressman had supported in favor of more tax reductions.<ref>[http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/02/the-progressive-gadfly-defazio-explains-his-no-on-stimulus.php The Progressive Gadfly: DeFazio Explains His 'No' on Stimulus]</ref> He also advocated that the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] change its [[cloture]] rules, doing away with the filibuster that, in the current 59–41 Democratic majority, gives Republicans the ability to block legislation from coming to a vote.<ref>{{cite news

DeFazio, speaking to press after the exchange, professed that he was honored that Obama recognized him and the issues of his constituents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2009/03/defazio_gets_obama_jibe_on_sti.html|title=DeFazio gets Obama jibe on stimulus vote|agency=''The Oregonian''|first=Jeff|last=Mapes|date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>

DeFazio made headlines in mid-November 2009 when he suggested in an interview with [[MSNBC]] commentator [[Ed Schultz]] that President Obama should fire [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]] and [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council Director]] [[Lawrence Summers]]. "We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get back millions for Americans," said DeFazio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/18/rep-defazio-fire-timmy-ge_n_363093.html|agency=''The Huffington Post'' and MSNBC|title=Rep.

A year later he called for the impeachment of Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] because of the Supreme Court ruling on [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]].

In 2009, DeFazio proposed a [[financial transaction tax]] for within the [[United States]] only (not internationally).<ref name="calls for">{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/12/defazio_calls_for_tax_on_high.html|title=DeFazio calls for tax on financial transactions but critics abound |author=Charles Pope |date=December 2009 |work= |publisher= [[The Oregonian]], OregonLive.com|accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> (See [[DeFazio financial transaction tax]].)

During his tenure, DeFazio has butted heads with fellow Democratic politicians, including President [[Barack Obama]], on key Democratic legislation. In December 2010, DeFazio told CNN that “The White House is putting on tremendous pressure” about legislation extending the [[Bush tax cuts]], “the president is making phone calls saying this is the end of his presidency if he doesn't get this bad deal.” According to The Hill, "The president hasn’t said anything remotely like that and has never spoken with Mr. DeFazio about the issue," said White House spokesman [[Tommy Vietor]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama tells lawmakers not passing tax deal could end presidency, Dem says|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/133909-obama-tells-lawmakers-notpassing-tax-deal-could-end-presidency-dem-says|publisher=The Hill|accessdate=21 May 2012|author=Jordan Fabian|date=12/15/10}}</ref> In August 2011, Defazio stated the President lacked the fight to follow-through in restoring the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy, citing the pressure placed on him by the Republicans as the reason.<ref>{{cite web|title=DeFazio says Obama lacks will to fight, may lose Oregon|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Democratic-Oregon-Congressman-Rips-into-President-128046958.html|publisher=Channel 8 News, Portland Oregon|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Pat Dooris|date=August 19, 2011}}</ref> DeFazio, along with fellow congressman Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bernie Sanders, stated that it would be good for the Democratic party if the president faced a meaningful primary, where all the issues would be aired out.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Hampshire Results Point to a Notable Democratic Enthusiasm Gap|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/165602/new-hampshire-results-point-notable-democratic-enthusiasm-gap|publisher=TheNaiton.com|accessdate=15 June 2012|author=John Nichols|date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

In October 2011, [[Think Progress]] noted that DeFazio, “Echoing the demands of the Occupy Wall Street protesters,...is proposing to tax the trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives. DeFazio, along with his Senate co-sponsor Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), has proposed the tax several times in the past. But this time around, the idea is getting a boost of momentum from the popularity of a similar measure in Europe, as well as renewed national media focus on Wall Street profiteering as a result of the 99 Percent Movement.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling Wall Street A ‘Gambling Casino,’ Democratic Rep.

Also in October 2011, the [[Daily Caller]] used DeFazio as an example of the increase in “institutional support” being enjoyed by the Occupy movement.  Speaking on the House floor, DeFazio said, “Something is happening. Something in this land is happening. I call it the 'American Awakening.'”  He added that “I think the young people and the others who are joining them on Wall Street get it. They may not be totally focused, but they know that this is not a country that gives them a fair shot at the American dream anymore — it is a stacked deck.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Dems rally in support of ‘Occupy Wall Street’|url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/06/congressional-dems-rally-in-support-of-occupy-wallstreet/|publisher=The Daily Caller|accessdate=26 June 2012|author=Caroline May|date=10/06/2011}}</ref>

DeFazio opposed the [[Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].<ref name=cbo4899>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4899|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr4899.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.<ref name="HousePassesMarcos"/><ref name="GraeberUPI"/> DeFazio argued that the bill did not solve the true cause of high gas prices which he blamed on "Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street."<ref name=HousePassesMarcos>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to increase offshore energy projects|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/210690-house-passes-bill-to-increase-offshore-energy-projects|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=26 June 2014}}</ref> DeFazio called the bill the "drill everywhere" bill.<ref name=GraeberUPI>{{cite news|last1=Graeber|first1=Daniel J.|title=House measure on gas aimed at lower prices|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/06/27/House-measure-on-gas-aimed-at-lower-prices/9031403872288/|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=UPI|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

==U.S. Senate elections==
[[File:Peter DeFazio, official Congressional photo portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Early official portrait of Peter DeFazio.]]

===1995===
After Senator [[Bob Packwood]] resigned in early September 1995, DeFazio ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the [[United States Senate]] in a [[By-election|special primary]], losing to 3rd District Congressman [[Ron Wyden]]. Wyden started out with clear advantages over DeFazio; more seniority, a base in the large [[Portland, Oregon|Portland]] media market and more cash on hand in his campaign committee.  However, DeFazio's scrappy campaign style, underscored by his TV ads featuring his populist musings while driving in his [[Dodge Dart]], made him a favorite among many Democratic activists.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  Ultimately, DeFazio lost to Wyden by only 6% in the Democratic primary,<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&year=1995&f=0&off=3&elect=7|title = 1995 Senatorial Special Election Results - Oregon|date = 5 Jan 2007|accessdate = June 21, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref> despite his early lead of 20%.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Wyden, bruised by the primary and trailing State Senator [[Gordon H. Smith]], managed to pull off an upset against Smith in the [[United States Senate special election in Oregon, 1996|January 1996 special election]].

===1996===
DeFazio had been mentioned to run for the seat of Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], who announced after the special primary election that he would not seek re-election in 1996. However, faced with the prospect of having to take on well-funded millionaires in both the primary and general election, DeFazio announced in February 1996 that he would not run.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Personal life ==
DeFazio is a member of the [[Catholicism and American politics|Roman Catholic Church]]. He and his wife, Myrnie Daut,<ref name="votesmart"/> reside in [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]].
