'''Marian Krogius "Mimi" Walters''' (born May 14, 1962) is a [[United States|U.S.]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician from the state of [[California]], representing the 37th District of the [[California State Senate]] since 2012.  She previously represented the 33rd Senate District from 2008 to 2012 before redistricting.{{cn|date=November 2014}}  She also served in the California State Assembly from 2004 to 2008, where she served in the Republican leadership as Assistant Republican [[Floor Leader|Leader]] and Vice Chair of the [[Appropriation (law)|Appropriations]] Committee.

On November 4, 2014, Walters was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[CA-45|California’s 45th congressional district]], which is being vacated by Congressman [[John B.T. Campbell III|John Campbell]]. She was subsequently elected by her colleagues as the Freshman Class Representative to the [[House Republican Conference]] leadership team for the [[114th United States Congress]].

==Early years and education==
Walters earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Political Science]] from [[University of California, Los Angeles|UCLA]] in 1984. Before her election to the [[California State Assembly]], Walters was a [[stockbroker]].

==Political career==
Walters was Councilwoman and Mayor of [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]] during 1996–2004, and helped defeat efforts to convert [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] to a commercial airport.

Walters was elected in 2004 to represent the 73rd Assembly District, which includes coastal [[Orange County, California|Orange]] and [[San Diego, California|San Diego]] county communities of [[Laguna Niguel, California|Laguna Niguel]], [[Laguna Hills, California|Laguna Hills]], [[Oceanside, California|Oceanside]], [[Dana Point, California|Dana Point]], [[San Clemente, California|San Clemente]], [[San Juan Capistrano, California|San Juan Capistrano]], and [[Aliso Viejo, California|Aliso Viejo]].

Since the [[Supreme Court of the United States|US Supreme Court]] decision ''[[Kelo v. City of New London|Kelo v. New London]]'' in June 2005, Walters has been at the forefront of amending California government acquisition and the regulation of private property laws. She introduced two bills, AB 590 and AB 1990, in the 2005-06 session on these topics.  After both bills failed in committee by party line votes, Walters became a leading figure in the campaign for [[California Proposition 90|Proposition 90]].  She was named honorary chair of the Save Our Homes initiative campaign.  Supporters of Proposition 90 referred to their effort as protecting property rights.  The initiative received over one million signatures to qualify for the November 2006 ballot.  Proposition 90 failed with 47.6% of the vote.

In the 2007-2008 session, Walters introduced ACA 2, a state Constitutional Amendment to change government acquisition and the regulation of private property by California local governments.

Walters introduced a package of bills in February 2011 to address the California pension crisis, SB 520 through SB 528.<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/2011/03/06/3453456/pensions-emerge-as-key-issue-in.html Pensions Emerge as Key Issue]</ref>

In an op-ed written by Senator Walters in October of 2012, Walters questioned the wisdom of creating a state-run retirement pension plan for private-sector workers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Walters|first=Mimi|title=State-Run Private Sector Retirement Plans Subsidized by Taxpayers Coming in 2013|url=http://district37.cssrc.us/content/state-run-private-sector-retirement-plans-subsidized-taxpayers-coming-2013}}</ref>   The bill, SB 1234, established the California Secure Choice Retirement Savings Program for private-sector workers that requires employers that may not offer retirement plans to participate in the program.<ref>{{cite web|first=California Legislature|title=SB1234|url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1234}}</ref> 

Walters is the co-founder of the California Women’s Leadership Association (CWLA.) She currently serves on the Board of the Orange County Gang Reduction Intervention Program (G.R.I.P.). She has also served on the Boards of the [[National Association of Women Business Owners]] (NAWBO,) the Laguna Niguel Republican Women Federated, the [[American Cancer Society]], and the South Coast Medical Center Foundation.

===2010 California State Treasurer election===
In January 2010, Walters announced that she would run for [[California State Treasurer]] against Democratic incumbent [[Bill Lockyer]]. She became the [[California Republican Party|Republican]] nominee for State Treasurer the following June.

===Investigation by the Fair Political Practices Commission===
In early 2012, the Fair Political Practice Commission opened an inquiry as to whether Walters violated conflict-of-interest laws when her office assisted constituents who were having problems receiving feedback from California prison officials regarding the status of a financial claim that Senator Walters husband ultimately had an economic interest in.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=Ethics panel investigates state Sen. Mimi Walters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/local/la-me-walters-ethics-20120615}}</ref> 

The inquiry was disclosed in a written notice to Walters' attorney by Gary Winuk, chief of enforcement for the state Fair Political Practices Commission. He wrote that his office "will be pursuing an investigation regarding whether or not Sen. Walters violated the Political Reform Act's conflict-of-interest prohibitions."<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=Ethics panel investigates state Sen. Mimi Walters|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/jun/15/local/la-me-walters-ethics-20120615|newspaper=L.A. Times}}</ref>

The FPPC inquiry ultimately found that there was no wrongdoing on the part of Senator Walters or her staff. <ref>http://www.ocregister.com/news/walters-503341-state-company.html</ref>

===2012 California State Senate race===
On September 20, 2012, Democratic candidate Steven R. Young filed a petition of extraordinary writ<ref>[http://www.steveyoungforcalifornia.com/walters_complaint.pdf Petition of extraordinary writ]</ref> seeking declaratory relief to the California Secretary of State to exclude opponent Mimi Walters from the 2012 election ballot for failing to establish a clear residency status in the district she was running in. Under state law, state legislators are required to live in the districts they represent.<ref>{{cite web|title=California Election Code section 201|url=http://codes.lp.findlaw.com/cacode/ELEC/1/d0.5/3/s201}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=California Election Code Section 2040-8041|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/cgi-bin/displaycode?section=elec&group=08001-09000&file=8040-8041}}</ref> 

Walters and her family have long been associated with Laguna Niguel, where she served on the City Council and was elected to two terms in the Assembly and one in the Senate. But last year, the new California Citizens Redistricting Commission re-drew the state’s legislative districts. To run in the newly drawn 37th Senate District, Walters says she moved to Irvine. Young and two registered Republicans who have joined in the suit say Walters’ move was pure fiction. According to the suit, Walters and her husband, David, have lived in a 14,000-square-foot mansion in Laguna Niguel since 1999. Then, this year, the suit says that Walters changed her voter registration to reflect that she’s living in a 570-square-foot apartment in Irvine with no dishwasher or washer/dryer hook ups.<ref>{{cite news|last=McGreevy|first=Patrick|title=State Sen. Mimi Walters challenged by opponent over her residency|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/california-politics/2012/09/senator-mimi-walters-challenged-by-opponent-on-whether-she-lives-in-district.html|newspaper=LATimes}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Democrat sues to keep Mimi Walters off the ballot |author=Brian Joseph |url=http://totalbuzz.ocregister.com/2012/09/20/democrat-sues-to-keep-mimi-walters-off-the-ballot/88856/ |newspaper=OC Register |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=1 October 2012}}</ref>

A [[Sacramento County Superior Court]] judge denied Young's petition to have Walters' name removed from the ballot. According to the judge, "the court doesn't have jurisdiction to hear questions about the qualifications of members of the state Legislature." <ref>http://www.ocregister.com/totalbuzz/walters-469534-district-senate.html</ref>

===2014 Congressional race===
On July 2, 2013, Walters formally announced her candidacy for Congress, replacing Congressman John Campbell, who announced he would not be seeking another term. <ref>http://mimiwalters.com/2013/07/mimi-walters-formally-enters-congressional-race-in-45th-district/</ref> She was endorsed by a number of Republican Congressmen from California, including Campbell, [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]], [[Darrell Issa]], and [[Ed Royce]].<ref>http://www.mimiwalters.com/endorsements/</ref>  Walters was placed in the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]'s (NRCC) "Contender" category of their "Young Guns" program.<ref>http://www.nrcc.org/2014/03/26/17-republican-candidates-announced-contender-part-nrccs-young-guns-program/</ref> In September 2014, the NRCC named Walters along with 13 other candidates to their "Vanguard" program.<ref>http://www.gopyoungguns.com/vanguard/</ref> In the nonpartisan blanket primary, she came in first place in a field of three candidates with 44.8% of the vote. In the general election, she defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Drew Leavens with 65.2% of the vote.<ref>http://www.dl45th.com/</ref>

==Personal life==
She and her husband, David, live in [[Laguna_Niguel#Neighborhoods|Bear Brand Ranch]] in [[Laguna Niguel]] with their four children, Katherine, Caroline, David Jr. and Tristan.
