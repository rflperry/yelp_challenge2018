'''Glenn Grothman''' (born July 3, 1955) is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member-elect of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Wisconsin's 6th congressional district]]. He has been the Assistant Majority Leader of the [[Wisconsin Senate]], representing the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 20|20th District]] in southeastern Wisconsin since 2005. The district includes the city of [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], other parts of [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]], and parts of [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]],  [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee]] counties. Previously, Grothman served in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]], representing the 58th Assembly District from 1993 until 2005, served as the vice chair of the Assembly's Republican caucus from 1999 to 2004, and as Wisconsin Senator from the 20th district from 2005 to 2015, and Assistant Majority Leader of the [[Wisconsin Senate]] from 2011 to 2015.

==Early life and education==
Grothman graduated from [[Homestead High School (Mequon, Wisconsin)|Homestead High School]] in [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]], and attended the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] for his undergraduate degree.<ref name="official bio"/> In 1983, he received his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]].

==Wisconsin legislature==
Grothman was elected to the 58th Assembly District in a special election held in December 1993. From 1999 to 2004, he was the Assembly Majority Caucus Vice Chairperson. In 2004, he challenged State Senate Majority Leader [[Mary Panzer]] in the Republican primary.  He ran well to Panzer's right, charging that she was insufficiently conservative.<ref>http://badgerherald.com/news/2004/09/17/grothman_makes_rare_.php</ref>  He won the nomination in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Panzer's 21 percent.<ref>[http://165.189.88.185/docview.asp?docid=1382&locid=47 Wisconsin State Elections Board, Results for September 14, 2004]</ref>  He was unopposed in the general election for this heavily Republican district.<ref name=2004results/> From 2007 to 2008, he was the Senate Minority Caucus Chairperson. He has been the assistant Republican leader since 2009, serving as assistant minority leader from 2009 to 2010 and as assistant majority leader since 2011.<ref name="official bio"/> Grothman is a member of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].

As of 2009, Grothman was the only Republican Wisconsin Senator with a law degree.<ref name="lawyer legislator"/>

==Political positions==

===4-year-old kindergarten===
Grothman believes the kindergarten program for 4-year-olds should be defunded by Governor Scott Walker because any academic benefits disappear by the fourth grade, and the program is used by school districts to pad their budgets to get more state aid.<ref name="kindergarten"/>

===Concealed carry===
An advocate of [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights, Grothman is a long-time supporter of [[concealed carry]] legislation, but does not advocate allowing concealed weapons in taverns. He believes concealed carry laws would deter criminal behavior, with permits being awarded to law-abiding citizens who pass a [[gun safety]] course.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grothman|first=Glenn|title=A Good Idea|url=http://www.grothman.org/AD58/031001AD58.pdf|publisher=grothman.org}}</ref>

Grothman co-introduced 2011 SB 93, which was signed into law by Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 SB 93|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb93|publisher=Legislative Reference Bureau|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> This bill made Wisconsin the 49th state to legalize concealed carry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Brent|title=Wisconsin to Become 49th State to Allow Right-to-Carry|url=http://www.nranews.com/a1f/video/wisconsin-to-become-49th-state-to-allow-right-to-carry/list/concealed-carry|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=NRA News|date=24 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Equal pay ===
Speaking in support of Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker's]] decision to repeal the Wisconsin Equal Pay Act, Grothman stated that the alleged pay differential is explainable: "Once you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears." 
<ref name="Daily Beast">{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Michelle|title=Wisconsin’s Repeal of Equal Pay Rights Adds to Battles for Women|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/07/wisconsin-s-repeal-of-equal-pay-rights-adds-to-battles-for-women.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> However, a study by the American Association of University Women in 2007 found that life choices and family circumstances explain only a portion of the difference in pay between genders. Grothman rejected that study, further claiming, "You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious. To attribute everything to a so-called bias in the workplace is just not true.”<ref name="Daily Beast" />

State Rep. [[Christine Sinicki]] accused Grothman of believing "that women belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies." [[Politifact]] rated that accusation as False.<ref>{{cite news|last=Umhoefer|first=Dave|title=State Rep. Christine Sinicki says Sen. Glenn Grothman said that women belong "at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies."|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/04/christine-sinicki/state-rep-christine-sinicki-says-sen-glenn-grothma/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=4 March 2012}}</ref>

===Homosexuality===
He opposed a provision in a 2010 sex education law that prohibited teachers from promoting bias based on sexual orientation, saying that he did not believe the topic should be discussed at all in the public schools. According to the ''Capitol Times'', Grothman's opposition was based on the belief that instructors who lead these talks would have what he called an "agenda" to persuade students to become gay.<ref name="don't ask"/> He postulated that "Part of that agenda which is left unsaid is that some of those who throw it out as an option would like it if more kids became homosexuals."<ref name="don't ask" />

Grothman stated that he was concerned about what God might think of the United States after [[Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] announced plans to send scientists to [[Uganda]] "to help them understand homosexuality."<ref name="Cap Times">{{cite news|last1=Elbow|first1=Steven|title=Glenn Grothman blasts U.S. moves against draconian Ugandan homosexuality law|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/glenn-grothman-blasts-u-s-moves-against-draconian-ugandan-homosexuality/article_ea072139-28d3-5019-be2e-13dd01e83029.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|work=The Cap Times|date=30 April 2014}}</ref> He said Republicans, conservatives, and church leaders were not confronting the issue of homosexuality and were "losing the issue." He stated, "We had such a great country in the relatively recent past. Now America, supposed to be the light of the world, instead we’re the light going in the opposite direction.”<ref name="Cap Times" /><ref name="Huff Post Uganda">{{cite news|last1=Lachman|first1=Samantha|title=Glenn Grothman: John Kerry Upset God By Trying To Stop Ugandan Anti-LGBT Bill|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/29/glenn-grothman-god_n_5234401.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=29 April 1014}}</ref>

===Kwanzaa===
Grothman claimed, in a December 2012 press release, that [[Kwanzaa]] is not a real holiday. He claimed, "Of course, almost no black people today care about Kwanzaa - just white left-wingers who try to shove this down black people's throats in an effort to divide Americans."<ref name="Kwanzaa PR">{{cite web|last1=Grothman|first1=Glenn|title=Press Release|url=http://thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/1231grothman.pdf|website=Wheeler Report|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

He released a statement opposing a [[Kwanzaa]] holiday, stating that we should "treat Kwanzaa with the
contempt it deserves before it becomes a permanent part of our culture."<ref>{{cite web|author=Representative Glenn Grothman |url=http://www.grothman.org/AD58/031209AD58.pdf |title=What is Kwanzaa? |accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref>

===Martin Luther King, Jr. Day===
Grothman has argued that [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] should not be a state employee holiday, calling the day off "an insult to all the other taxpayers around the state." He has expressed doubts that "state workers would be 'checking out DVDs or reading books' about King and would probably just be out shopping or watching television instead."<ref name="MLK day"/>

===Municipal water chlorination===
He was a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 19 (2011), which removes the requirement of mandatory chlorination of groundwater in municipal water systems.<ref name="data"/><ref>{{cite web|title=2011-2012 Wisconsin Legislature Senate Bill 19|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb19|publisher=State of Wisconsin|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> This bill was supported by the [[League of Wisconsin Municipalities]] which argued that it was unnecessary and expensive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witynski|first=Curt|title=Repealing Mandatory Disinfection|url=http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/3-29-3011-Support_for_SB_19_Mandatory_Disinfection_of_Water_Systems.pdf|publisher=League of Wisconsin Municipalities|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

===Raw milk===
Grothman is a vocal supporter of decriminalizing [[raw milk]] sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why I Support Raw Milk|url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/grothman/issues/documents/Raw%20Milk%20Column%20-%20Why%20I%20Support%20Raw%20Milk%202010.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kinzel|first=Mike|title=Senator Grothman continues push for raw milk sales|url=http://whbl.com/news/articles/2013/dec/10/senator-grothman-continues-push-for-raw-milk-sales/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=WHBL|date=10 December 2013}}</ref>

===Single parenthood===
In February 2012, Grothman introduced Senate Bill 507, which would amend Wisconsin statutes to emphasize [[single parent]]hood as a contributing factor to [[child abuse]] and [[Child neglect|neglect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SB507: Bill Text|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/sb507|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> [[Politifact]] investigated his claim that kids living with a parent and parent's partner are "20 times" more likely to be sexually abused, and rated it True.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kertscher|first=Tom|title=GOP Wisconsin state senator says study shows kids living with parent and parent's partner "20 times" more likely to be sexually abused|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/25/glenn-grothman/gop-wisconsin-state-senator-says-study-shows-kids-/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=25 March 2012}}</ref> Grothman claimed that modern women were choosing to have children out of wedlock and "we should educate women that this is a mistake."<ref name="Huffington Post 03/07/2012">{{cite web|last1=Lavender|first1=Paige|title=Glenn Grothman, Wisconsin Senator, Says Unplanned Pregnancies Are The 'Choice Of The Women'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/glenn-grothman-unplanned-pregnancies_n_1327940.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

He also sponsored State Bill 202, which would have repealed the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that the "Left and the social welfare establishment want children born out of wedlock because they are far more likely to be dependent on the government."<ref name="Alphonse">{{cite news|last=Alphonse|first=Lylah M.|title=Wisconsin Bill Claims Single Moms Cause Child Abuse by Not Being Married|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/wisconsin-bill-claims-single-moms-cause-child-abuse-011200419.html|newspaper=Yahoo! Shine|date=March 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Smoking===
Grothman opposed a bill that would increase funding for anti-smoking programs from $10 to $30 million. He believes that [[anti-smoking campaign]]s do not work, and are no longer necessary, writing "Everybody knows you're not supposed to smoke!."<ref name="everybody knows"/> He also voted against the ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and other small business that became effective in July 2010.<ref name="indoor smoking"/> After the bill was passed, he introduced new legislation to allow guests to smoke in hotel rooms.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. He also co-sponsored a bill to exempt electronic cigarettes from the smoking ban.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Senate Bill 389|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb389|publisher=Legistlative Reference Bureau|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

===Welfare Reform===
In June 2013, Grothman advocated for reforming welfare in Wisconsin. He advocated requiring nondisabled single adults to either work twenty hours per week, or attend twenty hours of job training per week to continue receiving FoodShare benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grothman|first=Glenn|title=Grothman Stands with Governor Walker on FoodShare Reform|url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/grothman/PressReleases/Pages/Grothman-Stands-with-Governor-Walker-on-FoodShare-Reform.aspx|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

==2011 Wisconsin budget protests==
{{Further|2011 Wisconsin budget protests}}
Grothman has been a vocal proponent of SB11, a controversial bill proposed by Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] in early 2011. He has said he supports the so-called budget repair bill because it is fiscally responsible. In a recent press interview, he said that he did not "find it impressive" that over 70,000 protesters marched on the capitol.<ref name="protests not"/>

During the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling "Shame! Shame!" outside the state capitol building. Grothman said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding that, "They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd." He also described the protesters as "a different breed of person" and "a bunch of slobs taking up the building."<ref name="lawmaker chased"/><ref name="slobs"/>

During this time, Grothman also advocated the hiring of more business-friendly individuals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one of the University of Wisconsin campuses as a target: "Maybe you (should) look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn't know what the real world is like."  This was only days before appearing at UW—Stevens Point with the Joint Finance Committee for a day of hearings on Scott Walker's budget bill.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/119195389.html "Grothman urges DNR to hire older workers"] JSOnline - All Politics Blog: 2011-04-04. Retrieved 2011-04-11.</ref>

Grothman was subject to a recall effort in the spring of 2011, but the effort failed, collecting only 75% of the required signatures.<ref>[http://www.ozaukeepress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1793:aggressive-effort-to-recall-grothman-falls-short&catid=49:feature-1 "Aggressive effort to recall Grothman falls short," by Bill Schanen IV, Ozaukee Press, 4 May 2011]</ref> During the recall, Grothman supporters gathered hundreds of signatures for a giant "Thank You" card for Grothman.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steffes|first=Judy|title=Thank you signatures trump recall of Senator Grothman|url=http://washco.fox6now.com/news/community-spirit/thank-you-signatures-trump-recall-senator-grothman/62117|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Fox 6 Now|date=5 April 2011}}</ref>

'''Glenn Grothman''' (born July 3, 1955) is the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member-elect of the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from [[Wisconsin's 6th congressional district]]. He has been the Assistant Majority Leader of the [[Wisconsin Senate]], representing the [[Wisconsin Senate, District 20|20th District]] in southeastern Wisconsin since 2005. The district includes the city of [[West Bend, Wisconsin|West Bend]], other parts of [[Washington County, Wisconsin|Washington County]], and parts of [[Fond du Lac County, Wisconsin|Fond du Lac]], [[Dodge County, Wisconsin|Dodge]],  [[Sheboygan County, Wisconsin|Sheboygan]], and [[Ozaukee County, Wisconsin|Ozaukee]] counties. Previously, Grothman served in the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]], representing the 58th Assembly District from 1993 until 2005, served as the vice chair of the Assembly's Republican caucus from 1999 to 2004, and as Wisconsin Senator from the 20th district from 2005 to 2015, and Assistant Majority Leader of the [[Wisconsin Senate]] from 2011 to 2015.

==Early life and education==
Grothman graduated from [[Homestead High School (Mequon, Wisconsin)|Homestead High School]] in [[Mequon, Wisconsin|Mequon]], and attended the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] for his undergraduate degree.<ref name="official bio"/> In 1983, he received his [[Juris Doctor|law degree]] from the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]].

==Wisconsin legislature==
Grothman was elected to the 58th Assembly District in a special election held in December 1993. From 1999 to 2004, he was the Assembly Majority Caucus Vice Chairperson. In 2004, he challenged State Senate Majority Leader [[Mary Panzer]] in the Republican primary.  He ran well to Panzer's right, charging that she was insufficiently conservative.<ref>http://badgerherald.com/news/2004/09/17/grothman_makes_rare_.php</ref>  He won the nomination in a rout, taking 79 percent of the vote to Panzer's 21 percent.<ref>[http://165.189.88.185/docview.asp?docid=1382&locid=47 Wisconsin State Elections Board, Results for September 14, 2004]</ref>  He was unopposed in the general election for this heavily Republican district.<ref name=2004results/> From 2007 to 2008, he was the Senate Minority Caucus Chairperson. He has been the assistant Republican leader since 2009, serving as assistant minority leader from 2009 to 2010 and as assistant majority leader since 2011.<ref name="official bio"/> Grothman is a member of the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]].

As of 2009, Grothman was the only Republican Wisconsin Senator with a law degree.<ref name="lawyer legislator"/>

==Political positions==

===4-year-old kindergarten===
Grothman believes the kindergarten program for 4-year-olds should be defunded by Governor Scott Walker because any academic benefits disappear by the fourth grade, and the program is used by school districts to pad their budgets to get more state aid.<ref name="kindergarten"/>

===Concealed carry===
An advocate of [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] rights, Grothman is a long-time supporter of [[concealed carry]] legislation, but does not advocate allowing concealed weapons in taverns. He believes concealed carry laws would deter criminal behavior, with permits being awarded to law-abiding citizens who pass a [[gun safety]] course.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grothman|first=Glenn|title=A Good Idea|url=http://www.grothman.org/AD58/031001AD58.pdf|publisher=grothman.org}}</ref>

Grothman co-introduced 2011 SB 93, which was signed into law by Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]]<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 SB 93|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/reg/sen/bill/sb93|publisher=Legislative Reference Bureau|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> This bill made Wisconsin the 49th state to legalize concealed carry.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gardner|first=Brent|title=Wisconsin to Become 49th State to Allow Right-to-Carry|url=http://www.nranews.com/a1f/video/wisconsin-to-become-49th-state-to-allow-right-to-carry/list/concealed-carry|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=NRA News|date=24 June 2011}}</ref>

=== Equal pay ===
Speaking in support of Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker's]] decision to repeal the Wisconsin Equal Pay Act, Grothman stated that the alleged pay differential is explainable: "Once you break it down by married and unmarried, the differential disappears." 
<ref name="Daily Beast">{{cite web|last=Goldberg|first=Michelle|title=Wisconsin’s Repeal of Equal Pay Rights Adds to Battles for Women|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/04/07/wisconsin-s-repeal-of-equal-pay-rights-adds-to-battles-for-women.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref> However, a study by the American Association of University Women in 2007 found that life choices and family circumstances explain only a portion of the difference in pay between genders. Grothman rejected that study, further claiming, "You could argue that money is more important for men. I think a guy in their first job, maybe because they expect to be a breadwinner someday, may be a little more money-conscious. To attribute everything to a so-called bias in the workplace is just not true.”<ref name="Daily Beast" />

State Rep. [[Christine Sinicki]] accused Grothman of believing "that women belonged at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies." [[Politifact]] rated that accusation as False.<ref>{{cite news|last=Umhoefer|first=Dave|title=State Rep. Christine Sinicki says Sen. Glenn Grothman said that women belong "at home, cooking and cleaning and having babies."|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/04/christine-sinicki/state-rep-christine-sinicki-says-sen-glenn-grothma/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=4 March 2012}}</ref>

===Homosexuality===
He opposed a provision in a 2010 sex education law that prohibited teachers from promoting bias based on sexual orientation, saying that he did not believe the topic should be discussed at all in the public schools. According to the ''Capitol Times'', Grothman's opposition was based on the belief that instructors who lead these talks would have what he called an "agenda" to persuade students to become gay.<ref name="don't ask"/> He postulated that "Part of that agenda which is left unsaid is that some of those who throw it out as an option would like it if more kids became homosexuals."<ref name="don't ask" />

Grothman stated that he was concerned about what God might think of the United States after [[Secretary of State]] [[John Kerry]] announced plans to send scientists to [[Uganda]] "to help them understand homosexuality."<ref name="Cap Times">{{cite news|last1=Elbow|first1=Steven|title=Glenn Grothman blasts U.S. moves against draconian Ugandan homosexuality law|url=http://host.madison.com/news/local/writers/steven_elbow/glenn-grothman-blasts-u-s-moves-against-draconian-ugandan-homosexuality/article_ea072139-28d3-5019-be2e-13dd01e83029.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|work=The Cap Times|date=30 April 2014}}</ref> He said Republicans, conservatives, and church leaders were not confronting the issue of homosexuality and were "losing the issue." He stated, "We had such a great country in the relatively recent past. Now America, supposed to be the light of the world, instead we’re the light going in the opposite direction.”<ref name="Cap Times" /><ref name="Huff Post Uganda">{{cite news|last1=Lachman|first1=Samantha|title=Glenn Grothman: John Kerry Upset God By Trying To Stop Ugandan Anti-LGBT Bill|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/29/glenn-grothman-god_n_5234401.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|work=Huffington Post|date=29 April 1014}}</ref>

===Kwanzaa===
Grothman claimed, in a December 2012 press release, that [[Kwanzaa]] is not a real holiday. He claimed, "Of course, almost no black people today care about Kwanzaa - just white left-wingers who try to shove this down black people's throats in an effort to divide Americans."<ref name="Kwanzaa PR">{{cite web|last1=Grothman|first1=Glenn|title=Press Release|url=http://thewheelerreport.com/wheeler_docs/files/1231grothman.pdf|website=Wheeler Report|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

He released a statement opposing a [[Kwanzaa]] holiday, stating that we should "treat Kwanzaa with the
contempt it deserves before it becomes a permanent part of our culture."<ref>{{cite web|author=Representative Glenn Grothman |url=http://www.grothman.org/AD58/031209AD58.pdf |title=What is Kwanzaa? |accessdate=2011-03-04}}</ref>

===Martin Luther King, Jr. Day===
Grothman has argued that [[Martin Luther King, Jr. Day]] should not be a state employee holiday, calling the day off "an insult to all the other taxpayers around the state." He has expressed doubts that "state workers would be 'checking out DVDs or reading books' about King and would probably just be out shopping or watching television instead."<ref name="MLK day"/>

===Municipal water chlorination===
He was a co-sponsor of Senate Bill 19 (2011), which removes the requirement of mandatory chlorination of groundwater in municipal water systems.<ref name="data"/><ref>{{cite web|title=2011-2012 Wisconsin Legislature Senate Bill 19|url=http://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb19|publisher=State of Wisconsin|accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> This bill was supported by the [[League of Wisconsin Municipalities]] which argued that it was unnecessary and expensive.<ref>{{cite web|last=Witynski|first=Curt|title=Repealing Mandatory Disinfection|url=http://www.lwm-info.org/vertical/sites/%7B92F7D640-E25A-4317-90AD-4976378A8F8D%7D/uploads/3-29-3011-Support_for_SB_19_Mandatory_Disinfection_of_Water_Systems.pdf|publisher=League of Wisconsin Municipalities|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

===Raw milk===
Grothman is a vocal supporter of decriminalizing [[raw milk]] sales.<ref>{{cite web|title=Why I Support Raw Milk|url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/grothman/issues/documents/Raw%20Milk%20Column%20-%20Why%20I%20Support%20Raw%20Milk%202010.pdf|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Kinzel|first=Mike|title=Senator Grothman continues push for raw milk sales|url=http://whbl.com/news/articles/2013/dec/10/senator-grothman-continues-push-for-raw-milk-sales/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=WHBL|date=10 December 2013}}</ref>

===Single parenthood===
In February 2012, Grothman introduced Senate Bill 507, which would amend Wisconsin statutes to emphasize [[single parent]]hood as a contributing factor to [[child abuse]] and [[Child neglect|neglect]].<ref>{{cite web|title=SB507: Bill Text|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/related/proposals/sb507|publisher=Wisconsin Legislature|accessdate=March 6, 2012}}</ref> [[Politifact]] investigated his claim that kids living with a parent and parent's partner are "20 times" more likely to be sexually abused, and rated it True.<ref>{{cite news|last=Kertscher|first=Tom|title=GOP Wisconsin state senator says study shows kids living with parent and parent's partner "20 times" more likely to be sexually abused|url=http://www.politifact.com/wisconsin/statements/2012/mar/25/glenn-grothman/gop-wisconsin-state-senator-says-study-shows-kids-/|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|date=25 March 2012}}</ref> Grothman claimed that modern women were choosing to have children out of wedlock and "we should educate women that this is a mistake."<ref name="Huffington Post 03/07/2012">{{cite web|last1=Lavender|first1=Paige|title=Glenn Grothman, Wisconsin Senator, Says Unplanned Pregnancies Are The 'Choice Of The Women'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/07/glenn-grothman-unplanned-pregnancies_n_1327940.html|website=Huffington Post|accessdate=11 August 2014}}</ref>

He also sponsored State Bill 202, which would have repealed the Equal Pay Enforcement Act, saying that the "Left and the social welfare establishment want children born out of wedlock because they are far more likely to be dependent on the government."<ref name="Alphonse">{{cite news|last=Alphonse|first=Lylah M.|title=Wisconsin Bill Claims Single Moms Cause Child Abuse by Not Being Married|url=http://shine.yahoo.com/parenting/wisconsin-bill-claims-single-moms-cause-child-abuse-011200419.html|newspaper=Yahoo! Shine|date=March 2, 2012}}</ref>

===Smoking===
Grothman opposed a bill that would increase funding for anti-smoking programs from $10 to $30 million. He believes that [[anti-smoking campaign]]s do not work, and are no longer necessary, writing "Everybody knows you're not supposed to smoke!."<ref name="everybody knows"/> He also voted against the ban on smoking in bars, restaurants and other small business that became effective in July 2010.<ref name="indoor smoking"/> After the bill was passed, he introduced new legislation to allow guests to smoke in hotel rooms.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}. He also co-sponsored a bill to exempt electronic cigarettes from the smoking ban.<ref>{{cite web|title=2011 Senate Bill 389|url=https://docs.legis.wisconsin.gov/2011/proposals/sb389|publisher=Legistlative Reference Bureau|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

===Welfare Reform===
In June 2013, Grothman advocated for reforming welfare in Wisconsin. He advocated requiring nondisabled single adults to either work twenty hours per week, or attend twenty hours of job training per week to continue receiving FoodShare benefits.<ref>{{cite web|last=Grothman|first=Glenn|title=Grothman Stands with Governor Walker on FoodShare Reform|url=http://legis.wisconsin.gov/senate/grothman/PressReleases/Pages/Grothman-Stands-with-Governor-Walker-on-FoodShare-Reform.aspx|accessdate=4 April 2014}}</ref>

==2011 Wisconsin budget protests==
{{Further|2011 Wisconsin budget protests}}
Grothman has been a vocal proponent of SB11, a controversial bill proposed by Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] in early 2011. He has said he supports the so-called budget repair bill because it is fiscally responsible. In a recent press interview, he said that he did not "find it impressive" that over 70,000 protesters marched on the capitol.<ref name="protests not"/>

During the protests, Grothman was cornered by almost 200 pro-union protesters yelling "Shame! Shame!" outside the state capitol building. Grothman said he was not concerned about violence at the time, adding that, "They're loud, they'll give you the finger, and they yell at you, but I really think deep down inside they're just mostly college kids having fun, just like they're having fun sleeping with their girlfriends on air mattresses. That's the guts of that crowd." He also described the protesters as "a different breed of person" and "a bunch of slobs taking up the building."<ref name="lawmaker chased"/><ref name="slobs"/>

During this time, Grothman also advocated the hiring of more business-friendly individuals to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources.  In doing so, he went out of his way to single out one of the University of Wisconsin campuses as a target: "Maybe you (should) look to hire those people who know what the real world is like, rather than a recent graduate from UW-Stevens Point who doesn't know what the real world is like."  This was only days before appearing at UW—Stevens Point with the Joint Finance Committee for a day of hearings on Scott Walker's budget bill.<ref>[http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/119195389.html "Grothman urges DNR to hire older workers"] JSOnline - All Politics Blog: 2011-04-04. Retrieved 2011-04-11.</ref>

Grothman was subject to a recall effort in the spring of 2011, but the effort failed, collecting only 75% of the required signatures.<ref>[http://www.ozaukeepress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=1793:aggressive-effort-to-recall-grothman-falls-short&catid=49:feature-1 "Aggressive effort to recall Grothman falls short," by Bill Schanen IV, Ozaukee Press, 4 May 2011]</ref> During the recall, Grothman supporters gathered hundreds of signatures for a giant "Thank You" card for Grothman.<ref>{{cite news|last=Steffes|first=Judy|title=Thank you signatures trump recall of Senator Grothman|url=http://washco.fox6now.com/news/community-spirit/thank-you-signatures-trump-recall-senator-grothman/62117|accessdate=4 April 2014|newspaper=Fox 6 Now|date=5 April 2011}}</ref>
