'''Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise''' (born October 6, 1965) is the current [[United States House of Representatives]] Majority Whip and representative for {{ushr|LA|1}}, serving since 2008. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.html?day=20080410&today=20080410 |title=CURRENT HOUSE FLOOR PROCEEDINGS LEGISLATIVE DAY OF MAY 7, 2008 110TH CONGRESS - SECOND SESSION |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/new.html |title=Office of the clerk, U.S. House of Representative |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> and the chairman of the 170-member [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] House [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190010/With-Alexander-departing-delegation-s-clout-question|title=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190010/With-Alexander-departing-delegation-s-clout-question|title=Deborah Barfield Berry, With Alexander departing, delegation's clout in question?

Prior to his congressional tenure, Scalise served for four months in the [[Louisiana State Senate]] and twelve years in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. On June 19, 2014, Scalise was elected by his Republican colleagues to serve as [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives]]. He assumed office on August 1. He is the first Louisianan in the Majority Whip's position since [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hale Boggs]] of [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]] held the position from 1962 to 1971.

In 2014, controversy arose after Scalise acknowledged that in 2002 he had spoken at a meeting of a [[white supremacist]] group founded by [[David Duke]].

==Early life==
Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise is the son of Alfred J. Scalise and Carol Schilleci Scalise. After his mother's death, his father remarried and Maggie Penfold Scalise became his stepmother.<ref name=marriageannouncement1 />

Scalise graduated from [[Archbishop Rummel High School]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], with a major in [[computer programming]] and a minor in [[political science]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Charles|title=Home / Blogs / The Politics Blog The Politics Blog The Republicans' New Debt Ceiling "Menu"|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-menu-070813|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=Esquire|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

==Louisiana Legislature==
Scalise was elected three times to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1995, 1999, and 2003.  He initially succeeded fellow Republican Representative [[Quentin Dastugue|Quentin D. Dastugue]], who made an ill-fated bid for [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] in the 1995 primary. 

His legislative peers named him to the House Appropriations Committee as the representative of the First Congressional District. Scalise opposed the 2002 [[Stelly Plan]], a proposal by [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] Representative [[Vic Stelly]], since [[repeal]]ed, to reduce certain [[state sales tax]]es on food for home consumption and utilities in exchange for higher [[state income tax]]es.

Scalise was elected in the October 20, 2007, [[jungle primary|nonpartisan blanket primary]] to the District 9 seat in the [[Louisiana Senate]] vacated by the term-limited [[Ken Hollis]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. Scalise received 19,154 votes (61 percent) in a three-way contest. Fellow Republican Polly Thomas polled 8,948 votes (29 percent). A Democrat, David Gereighty, polled 3,154 votes (10 percent) in the heavily Republican-oriented district. Scalise was succeeded in the state House by his aide, [[Cameron Henry]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].

In the special election on November 4, 2008 to fill the remaining three and one-half years in Scalise's state Senate term, [[Conrad Appel]] defeated Polly Thomas, 21,853 (52.1 percent) to 20,065 (47.9 percent). Thomas had also lost the race for the seat in 2007 to Scalise.<ref>Louisiana Secretary of State, November 4, 2008, election results: http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&rqsdta=110408</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

On being asked by the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' to assign [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] a letter grade for Obama's first 100 days as [[President of the United States|President]], Scalise awarded the new president an ''L'' (for "[[Modern liberalism in the United States#"Liberal" as a derogatory epithet|liberal]]").<ref>Tilove, Jonathan, "Obama's first 100 days are graded on a curve" in ''Times-Picayune'' (New Orleans), 2009 April 29, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A6 (web version =  [http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/louisianas_congressional_deleg.html Louisiana's congressional delegation grades President Obama's first 100 days from A to L.)]</ref>

Scalise encouraged residents throughout Southeast Louisiana to provide feedback about the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers']] Category 5 proposal, titled Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) report.<ref>[http://scalise.house.gov/hurricane.shtml ''scalise.house.gov/hurricane'']{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In a June 5, 2009 letter to the editor of ''The Times-Picayune'', [[Anne Milling]], founder of the [[Women of the Storm]] wrote, "Kudos to Rep.

===Legislative history===
In 2011, Scalise became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (withdrawn Jan 23, 2012).<ref name="govtrack">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261 Bill H.R.3261]; GovTrack.us;</ref> As chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Scalise dismissed [[Derek Khanna]], a committee staffer, in December 2012 because of pressure from content industry lobbyists after the study committee published a memo advocating [[copyright]] reform.<ref>{{cite news | first = Timothy B. | last = Lee | title = Staffer axed by Republican group over retracted copyright-reform memo | date = December 6, 2012 | publisher = [[Cond√© Nast Publications]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/staffer-axed-by-republican-group-over-retracted-copyright-reform-memo/ | work = [[Ars Technica]] | accessdate = December 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Scalise voted against reauthorizing the [[Violence Against Women Act]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|title=Here's Who Voted Against the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/02/heres-who-voted-against-violence-against-women-act/62633/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Leadership race===
In the aftermath of Rep. [[Eric Cantor]]'s unexpected defeat by [[David Brat]] on June 10, 2014, Scalise launched a campaign to replace Rep. [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] in the position of [[Majority Whip]] of the House; McCarthy himself would replace Cantor as House Majority Leader. Scalise's ascent to leadership built on his "come-from-behind win in 2012 to become chairman" of the [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>Joachim, David S., [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/us/politics/steve-scalise-of-louisiana-gets-lift-from-fellow-southern-lawmakers.html "Louisianan Seeks to Extend Rapid Rise in House G.O.P."], New York ''Times'', June 19, 2014.

==Political campaigns==
===2008 special election===
{{main|Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 2008}}
In 2004, Scalise announced that he would run for the U.S. House but thereafter deferred to the preference of party leaders and supported Jindal, who won the position vacated by the successful U.S. senatorial candidate, [[David Vitter]].

In 2007, when Jindal was elected to the governorship of Louisiana, Scalise announced his intentions to seek the seat yet again. This time he received Republican party backing.

Scalise's strongest Republican primary opponent, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Timothy Burns (Louisiana politician)|Timothy G. "Tim" Burns]] from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] in [[St. Tammany Parish]], accused Scalise of [[push polling]], a practice in which a campaign contacts voters by telephone and asks probing questions which leave a negative impression of his opponent. Scalise defended his poll from criticism by Burns: "We were running a public opinion survey this week conducted by the largest Republican polling firm in the country, Public Opinion Strategies. . . . conducted with a sample of 300 people, and it shows Scalise at 57 percent, Burns at 26 percent and undecided at 17 percent The margin of error is 5.6 percent. We ran a fact-based public opinion survey, not a push poll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1205560202224150.xml&coll=1 |title=Scalise defends integrity of GOP runoff survey |publisher=NOLA.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> 

In the March 8, 2008, Republican primary, Scalise polled 16,799 votes (48 percent). He went on to win the [[runoff election]] on April 5 against Burns, who received 9,631 votes (28 percent) in the initial primary.<ref name="Runoff"/><ref name="Runoff">[http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/040508state.htm Louisiana Secretary of State Unofficial Election Results Inquiry Results for Election Date: 4/05/08]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/ |title='&#39;'nola.com'&#39;' ELECTIONS section |publisher=Nola.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref>

In the May 3 general election, Scalise received 33,867 votes (75.13 percent) to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Gilda Reed's 10,142 ballots (22.5 percent). Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.36 percent of the vote. Reed was a favorite of [[organized labor]] and the Democratic constituency groups. The First District has been Republican since 1977, when [[Bob Livingston]] won a special election.<ref>[http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&rqsdta=050308 Louisiana Secretary of State-Multi-Parish Elections Inquiry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Scalise was sworn in on May 7, 2008.

===2008===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2008#District 1}}
In the regularly scheduled election, Scalise was reelected over Democrat Jim Harlan, 66 percent to 34 percent.

===2010===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2010#District 1}}
Scalise defeated the Democratic nominee, Myron Katz, and an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]], Arden Wells, in his 2010 bid for reelection.

===2012===
In June 2009, Scalise joined [[Dan Kyle]], the former legislative auditor and the treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, as directors of a national [[U.S. President|presidential]] fund-raising effort promoting Governor Jindal. According to Kyle, the group hoped to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination.<ref name=jindal>{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/48123092.html|title=Michelle Millhollon, "Official pulls out of Jindal group", June 16, 2009|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}</ref> Others on the committee include former State Representative [[Woody Jenkins]]. Former Republican [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Tom Schedler]] of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role at the time as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]].<ref name=jindal/> In 2010, Schedler succeeded Dardenne as secretary of state.

In his own 2012 congressional race, Scalise prevailed with 193,490 votes (66.6 percent) over four opponents, the strongest of which was the Democrat M. V. "Vinny" Mendoza, who finished with 61,979 votes (21.3 percent). A second Republican, Gary King, received 24,838 votes (8.6 percent). Independent Arden Wells ran again and received 4,285 votes (1.5 percent) in his second race against Scalise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Legislation==
Scalise sponsored a bill called the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act. The bill makes the [[Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]] consolidate several of their reports into one report. The bill is expected to help streamline the FCC's work and make the agency more efficient.<ref>Harrison, Julie, [http://riponadvance.com/news/scalises-fcc-consolidation-bill-sails-through-house/4712 "Scalise‚Äôs FCC consolidation bill sails through House"], ''The Ripon Advance'', 9-12-13.

==EURO controversy==
In 2014, political blogger Lamar White, Jr. researched forum posts on white supremacist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and discovered that in 2002 Scalise had spoken at a conference organized by a white supremacist group.<ref name=Calderone>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/lamar-white-jr-scalise-blogger_n_6397078.html | title=How Louisiana Blogger Lamar White, Jr. Landed The Steve Scalise White Supremacist Scoop | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=December 30, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Calderone, Michael}}</ref> White, a law student, posted his findings on his blog, CenLamar.com.

In 2008, Scalise received $1,000 from David Duke's adviser, Kenny Knight. <ref name=Lavendar1>{{cite news|last1=Lavendar|first1=Paige|title=Longtime Adviser To David Duke Donated To Steve Scalise|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/31/kenny-knight-steve-scalise_n_6400636.html|accessdate=31 December 2014|publisher=Huffington Post|date=31 Dec 2014}}</ref><ref name=Nichols>{{cite web | url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/193961/steve-scalises-problem-republican-partys-problem | title=Steve Scalise‚Äôs Problem Is the Republican Party‚Äôs Problem | work=[[The Nation]] | date=December 31, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Nichols, John}}</ref>

Kenny Knight and his former girlfriend, Barbara Noble, said that Scalise did not speak at the EURO conference, but at a meeting of the Jefferson Heights Civic Association. The association met in the same location as the EURO conference, several hours before the conference began. According to Knight, a representative of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and a member of the Red Cross also spoke to attendees, who were mainly residents from Knight and Scalise's neighborhood. Knight says he invited Scalise because, ‚ÄúI wanted to reach out to him and give him an audience so he could talk to people from his district about legislation he was proposing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/kenny_knight_and_barbara_noble_claim_steve_scalise_never_spoke_to_euro_did.html|title=White Noise Did Steve Scalise Admit to Speaking at a White Supremacist Event He Never Attended?|work=Slate|date=December 31, 2014| accessdate=January 1, 2015| author=Woodruff, Betty}}</ref>  The EURO press release advertising the 2002 conference did not list Scalise as a speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/steve-scalise-not-mentioned-speaker-2002-press-release-white-supremacist-group_822604.html|title= Steve Scalise Not Mentioned As Speaker in 2002 Press Release By White Supremacist Group|publisher=Weekly Standard|date=31 Dec 2014| accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> 

On December 29, Niels Lesniewski of ''[[Roll Call]]'' reprinted an article that had been run in 1999, after Congressman [[Bob Livingston]] had resigned from Congress. Duke and Scalise were considering running for his seat and they and others were interviewed for the piece. When asked about a potential bid for Congress by Duke, Scalise had told the newspaper that he held many of the same conservative views as Duke, but was a more electable candidate, saying that Duke's novelty had worn off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/scalise-vitter-talked-to-roll-call-about-david-duke-in-1999/|title=What Scalise and Vitter Told Roll Call About David Duke in 1999|work=Roll Call|author=Niels Lesniewski|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref> Two days later, Louisiana political reporter Stephanie Grace recounted that during her first meeting with Scalise two decades ago, he had told her that he was "like David Duke without the baggage", baggage which Grace described as "Duke‚Äôs past, his racist and anti-Semitic views and his former role as a KKK grand wizard."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/state/11213737-123/stephanie-grace-scalises-pitch-to|title=Stephanie Grace: Scalise‚Äôs pitch to Duke supporters seems plausible|work=New Orleans Advocate|author=Stephanie Grace|date=December 31, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref>

'''Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise''' (born October 6, 1965) is the current [[United States House of Representatives]] Majority Whip and representative for {{ushr|LA|1}}, serving since 2008. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.html?day=20080410&today=20080410 |title=CURRENT HOUSE FLOOR PROCEEDINGS LEGISLATIVE DAY OF MAY 7, 2008 110TH CONGRESS - SECOND SESSION |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/new.html |title=Office of the clerk, U.S. House of Representative |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> and the chairman of the 170-member [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] House [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190010/With-Alexander-departing-delegation-s-clout-question|title=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190010/With-Alexander-departing-delegation-s-clout-question|title=Deborah Barfield Berry, With Alexander departing, delegation's clout in question?

Prior to his congressional tenure, Scalise served for four months in the [[Louisiana State Senate]] and twelve years in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. On June 19, 2014, Scalise was elected by his Republican colleagues to serve as [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives]]. He assumed office on August 1. He is the first Louisianan in the Majority Whip's position since [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hale Boggs]] of [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]] held the position from 1962 to 1971.

In 2014, controversy arose after Scalise acknowledged that in 2002 he had spoken at a meeting of a [[white supremacist]] group founded by [[David Duke]].

==Early life==
Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise is the son of Alfred J. Scalise and Carol Schilleci Scalise. After his mother's death, his father remarried and Maggie Penfold Scalise became his stepmother.<ref name=marriageannouncement1 />

Scalise graduated from [[Archbishop Rummel High School]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], with a major in [[computer programming]] and a minor in [[political science]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Charles|title=Home / Blogs / The Politics Blog The Politics Blog The Republicans' New Debt Ceiling "Menu"|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-menu-070813|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=Esquire|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

==Louisiana Legislature==
Scalise was elected three times to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1995, 1999, and 2003.  He initially succeeded fellow Republican Representative [[Quentin Dastugue|Quentin D. Dastugue]], who made an ill-fated bid for [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] in the 1995 primary. 

His legislative peers named him to the House Appropriations Committee as the representative of the First Congressional District. Scalise opposed the 2002 [[Stelly Plan]], a proposal by [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] Representative [[Vic Stelly]], since [[repeal]]ed, to reduce certain [[state sales tax]]es on food for home consumption and utilities in exchange for higher [[state income tax]]es.

Scalise was elected in the October 20, 2007, [[jungle primary|nonpartisan blanket primary]] to the District 9 seat in the [[Louisiana Senate]] vacated by the term-limited [[Ken Hollis]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. Scalise received 19,154 votes (61 percent) in a three-way contest. Fellow Republican Polly Thomas polled 8,948 votes (29 percent). A Democrat, David Gereighty, polled 3,154 votes (10 percent) in the heavily Republican-oriented district. Scalise was succeeded in the state House by his aide, [[Cameron Henry]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].

In the special election on November 4, 2008 to fill the remaining three and one-half years in Scalise's state Senate term, [[Conrad Appel]] defeated Polly Thomas, 21,853 (52.1 percent) to 20,065 (47.9 percent). Thomas had also lost the race for the seat in 2007 to Scalise.<ref>Louisiana Secretary of State, November 4, 2008, election results: http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&rqsdta=110408</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

On being asked by the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' to assign [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] a letter grade for Obama's first 100 days as [[President of the United States|President]], Scalise awarded the new president an ''L'' (for "[[Modern liberalism in the United States#"Liberal" as a derogatory epithet|liberal]]").<ref>Tilove, Jonathan, "Obama's first 100 days are graded on a curve" in ''Times-Picayune'' (New Orleans), 2009 April 29, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A6 (web version =  [http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/louisianas_congressional_deleg.html Louisiana's congressional delegation grades President Obama's first 100 days from A to L.)]</ref>

Scalise encouraged residents throughout Southeast Louisiana to provide feedback about the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers']] Category 5 proposal, titled Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) report.<ref>[http://scalise.house.gov/hurricane.shtml ''scalise.house.gov/hurricane'']{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In a June 5, 2009 letter to the editor of ''The Times-Picayune'', [[Anne Milling]], founder of the [[Women of the Storm]] wrote, "Kudos to Rep.

===Legislative history===
In 2011, Scalise became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (withdrawn Jan 23, 2012).<ref name="govtrack">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261 Bill H.R.3261]; GovTrack.us;</ref> As chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Scalise dismissed [[Derek Khanna]], a committee staffer, in December 2012 because of pressure from content industry lobbyists after the study committee published a memo advocating [[copyright]] reform.<ref>{{cite news | first = Timothy B. | last = Lee | title = Staffer axed by Republican group over retracted copyright-reform memo | date = December 6, 2012 | publisher = [[Cond√© Nast Publications]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/staffer-axed-by-republican-group-over-retracted-copyright-reform-memo/ | work = [[Ars Technica]] | accessdate = December 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Scalise voted against reauthorizing the [[Violence Against Women Act]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|title=Here's Who Voted Against the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/02/heres-who-voted-against-violence-against-women-act/62633/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Leadership race===
In the aftermath of Rep. [[Eric Cantor]]'s unexpected defeat by [[David Brat]] on June 10, 2014, Scalise launched a campaign to replace Rep. [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] in the position of [[Majority Whip]] of the House; McCarthy himself would replace Cantor as House Majority Leader. Scalise's ascent to leadership built on his "come-from-behind win in 2012 to become chairman" of the [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>Joachim, David S., [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/us/politics/steve-scalise-of-louisiana-gets-lift-from-fellow-southern-lawmakers.html "Louisianan Seeks to Extend Rapid Rise in House G.O.P."], New York ''Times'', June 19, 2014.

==Political campaigns==
===2008 special election===
{{main|Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 2008}}
In 2004, Scalise announced that he would run for the U.S. House but thereafter deferred to the preference of party leaders and supported Jindal, who won the position vacated by the successful U.S. senatorial candidate, [[David Vitter]].

In 2007, when Jindal was elected to the governorship of Louisiana, Scalise announced his intentions to seek the seat yet again. This time he received Republican party backing.

Scalise's strongest Republican primary opponent, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Timothy Burns (Louisiana politician)|Timothy G. "Tim" Burns]] from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] in [[St. Tammany Parish]], accused Scalise of [[push polling]], a practice in which a campaign contacts voters by telephone and asks probing questions which leave a negative impression of his opponent. Scalise defended his poll from criticism by Burns: "We were running a public opinion survey this week conducted by the largest Republican polling firm in the country, Public Opinion Strategies. . . . conducted with a sample of 300 people, and it shows Scalise at 57 percent, Burns at 26 percent and undecided at 17 percent The margin of error is 5.6 percent. We ran a fact-based public opinion survey, not a push poll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1205560202224150.xml&coll=1 |title=Scalise defends integrity of GOP runoff survey |publisher=NOLA.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> 

In the March 8, 2008, Republican primary, Scalise polled 16,799 votes (48 percent). He went on to win the [[runoff election]] on April 5 against Burns, who received 9,631 votes (28 percent) in the initial primary.<ref name="Runoff"/><ref name="Runoff">[http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/040508state.htm Louisiana Secretary of State Unofficial Election Results Inquiry Results for Election Date: 4/05/08]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/ |title='&#39;'nola.com'&#39;' ELECTIONS section |publisher=Nola.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref>

In the May 3 general election, Scalise received 33,867 votes (75.13 percent) to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Gilda Reed's 10,142 ballots (22.5 percent). Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.36 percent of the vote. Reed was a favorite of [[organized labor]] and the Democratic constituency groups. The First District has been Republican since 1977, when [[Bob Livingston]] won a special election.<ref>[http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&rqsdta=050308 Louisiana Secretary of State-Multi-Parish Elections Inquiry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Scalise was sworn in on May 7, 2008.

===2008===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2008#District 1}}
In the regularly scheduled election, Scalise was reelected over Democrat Jim Harlan, 66 percent to 34 percent.

===2010===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2010#District 1}}
Scalise defeated the Democratic nominee, Myron Katz, and an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]], Arden Wells, in his 2010 bid for reelection.

===2012===
In June 2009, Scalise joined [[Dan Kyle]], the former legislative auditor and the treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, as directors of a national [[U.S. President|presidential]] fund-raising effort promoting Governor Jindal. According to Kyle, the group hoped to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination.<ref name=jindal>{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/48123092.html|title=Michelle Millhollon, "Official pulls out of Jindal group", June 16, 2009|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}</ref> Others on the committee include former State Representative [[Woody Jenkins]]. Former Republican [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Tom Schedler]] of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role at the time as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]].<ref name=jindal/> In 2010, Schedler succeeded Dardenne as secretary of state.

In his own 2012 congressional race, Scalise prevailed with 193,490 votes (66.6 percent) over four opponents, the strongest of which was the Democrat M. V. "Vinny" Mendoza, who finished with 61,979 votes (21.3 percent). A second Republican, Gary King, received 24,838 votes (8.6 percent). Independent Arden Wells ran again and received 4,285 votes (1.5 percent) in his second race against Scalise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Legislation==
Scalise sponsored a bill called the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act. The bill makes the [[Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]] consolidate several of their reports into one report. The bill is expected to help streamline the FCC's work and make the agency more efficient.<ref>Harrison, Julie, [http://riponadvance.com/news/scalises-fcc-consolidation-bill-sails-through-house/4712 "Scalise‚Äôs FCC consolidation bill sails through House"], ''The Ripon Advance'', 9-12-13. (Retrieved 9-12-13).</ref>

==EURO controversy==
In 2014, political blogger Lamar White, Jr. researched forum posts on white supremacist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and discovered that in 2002 Scalise had spoken at a conference organized by a white supremacist group.<ref name=Calderone>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/lamar-white-jr-scalise-blogger_n_6397078.html | title=How Louisiana Blogger Lamar White, Jr. Landed The Steve Scalise White Supremacist Scoop | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=December 30, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Calderone, Michael}}</ref> White, a law student, posted his findings on his blog, CenLamar.com.

Kenny Knight and his former girlfriend, Barbara Noble, said that Scalise did not speak at the EURO conference, but at a meeting of the Jefferson Heights Civic Association. The association met in the same location as the EURO conference, several hours before the conference began. According to Knight, a representative of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and a member of the Red Cross also spoke to attendees, who were mainly residents from Knight and Scalise's neighborhood.

On December 29, Niels Lesniewski of ''[[Roll Call]]'' reprinted an article that had been run in 1999, after Congressman [[Bob Livingston]] had resigned from Congress. Duke and Scalise were considering running for his seat and they and others were interviewed for the piece. When asked about a potential bid for Congress by Duke, Scalise had told the newspaper that he held many of the same conservative views as Duke, but was a more electable candidate, saying that Duke's novelty had worn off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/scalise-vitter-talked-to-roll-call-about-david-duke-in-1999/|title=What Scalise and Vitter Told Roll Call About David Duke in 1999|work=Roll Call|author=Niels Lesniewski|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref> Two days later, Louisiana political reporter Stephanie Grace recounted that during her first meeting with Scalise two decades ago, he had told her that he was "like David Duke without the baggage", baggage which Grace described as "Duke‚Äôs past, his racist and anti-Semitic views and his former role as a KKK grand wizard."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/state/11213737-123/stephanie-grace-scalises-pitch-to|title=Stephanie Grace: Scalise‚Äôs pitch to Duke supporters seems plausible|work=New Orleans Advocate|author=Stephanie Grace|date=December 31, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref>

'''Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise''' (born October 6, 1965) is the current [[United States House of Representatives]] Majority Whip and representative for {{ushr|LA|1}}, serving since 2008. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/floorsummary/floor.html?day=20080410&today=20080410 |title=CURRENT HOUSE FLOOR PROCEEDINGS LEGISLATIVE DAY OF MAY 7, 2008 110TH CONGRESS - SECOND SESSION |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/new.html |title=Office of the clerk, U.S. House of Representative |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date=2008-05-07 |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> and the chairman of the 170-member [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] House [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190010/With-Alexander-departing-delegation-s-clout-question|title=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20130819/NEWS01/308190010/With-Alexander-departing-delegation-s-clout-question|title=Deborah Barfield Berry, With Alexander departing, delegation's clout in question?

Prior to his congressional tenure, Scalise served for four months in the [[Louisiana State Senate]] and twelve years in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. On June 19, 2014, Scalise was elected by his Republican colleagues to serve as [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives]]. He assumed office on August 1. He is the first Louisianan in the Majority Whip's position since [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hale Boggs]] of [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]] held the position from 1962 to 1971.

In 2014, controversy arose after Scalise acknowledged that in 2002 he had spoken at a meeting of a [[white supremacist]] group founded by [[David Duke]].

==Early life==
Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise is the son of Alfred J. Scalise and Carol Schilleci Scalise. After his mother's death, his father remarried and Maggie Penfold Scalise became his stepmother.<ref name=marriageannouncement1 />

Scalise graduated from [[Archbishop Rummel High School]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], with a major in [[computer programming]] and a minor in [[political science]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Charles|title=Home / Blogs / The Politics Blog The Politics Blog The Republicans' New Debt Ceiling "Menu"|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-menu-070813|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=Esquire|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

==Louisiana Legislature==
Scalise was elected three times to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1995, 1999, and 2003.  He initially succeeded fellow Republican Representative [[Quentin Dastugue|Quentin D. Dastugue]], who made an ill-fated bid for [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] in the 1995 primary. 

His legislative peers named him to the House Appropriations Committee as the representative of the First Congressional District. Scalise opposed the 2002 [[Stelly Plan]], a proposal by [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] Representative [[Vic Stelly]], since [[repeal]]ed, to reduce certain [[state sales tax]]es on food for home consumption and utilities in exchange for higher [[state income tax]]es.

Scalise was elected in the October 20, 2007, [[jungle primary|nonpartisan blanket primary]] to the District 9 seat in the [[Louisiana Senate]] vacated by the term-limited [[Ken Hollis]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. Scalise received 19,154 votes (61 percent) in a three-way contest. Fellow Republican Polly Thomas polled 8,948 votes (29 percent). A Democrat, David Gereighty, polled 3,154 votes (10 percent) in the heavily Republican-oriented district. Scalise was succeeded in the state House by his aide, [[Cameron Henry]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].

In the special election on November 4, 2008 to fill the remaining three and one-half years in Scalise's state Senate term, [[Conrad Appel]] defeated Polly Thomas, 21,853 (52.1 percent) to 20,065 (47.9 percent). Thomas had also lost the race for the seat in 2007 to Scalise.<ref>Louisiana Secretary of State, November 4, 2008, election results: http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&rqsdta=110408</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

On being asked by the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' to assign [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] a letter grade for Obama's first 100 days as [[President of the United States|President]], Scalise awarded the new president an ''L'' (for "[[Modern liberalism in the United States#"Liberal" as a derogatory epithet|liberal]]").<ref>Tilove, Jonathan, "Obama's first 100 days are graded on a curve" in ''Times-Picayune'' (New Orleans), 2009 April 29, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A6 (web version =  [http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/louisianas_congressional_deleg.html Louisiana's congressional delegation grades President Obama's first 100 days from A to L.)]</ref>

Scalise encouraged residents throughout Southeast Louisiana to provide feedback about the [[U.S. Army Corps of Engineers|Corps of Engineers']] Category 5 proposal, titled Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration (LACPR) report.<ref>[http://scalise.house.gov/hurricane.shtml ''scalise.house.gov/hurricane'']{{dead link|date=October 2013}}</ref> In a June 5, 2009 letter to the editor of ''The Times-Picayune'', [[Anne Milling]], founder of the [[Women of the Storm]] wrote, "Kudos to Rep.

===Legislative history===
In 2011, Scalise became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (withdrawn Jan 23, 2012).<ref name="govtrack">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261 Bill H.R.3261]; GovTrack.us;</ref> As chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Scalise dismissed [[Derek Khanna]], a committee staffer, in December 2012 because of pressure from content industry lobbyists after the study committee published a memo advocating [[copyright]] reform.<ref>{{cite news | first = Timothy B. | last = Lee | title = Staffer axed by Republican group over retracted copyright-reform memo | date = December 6, 2012 | publisher = [[Cond√© Nast Publications]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/staffer-axed-by-republican-group-over-retracted-copyright-reform-memo/ | work = [[Ars Technica]] | accessdate = December 8, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Scalise voted against reauthorizing the [[Violence Against Women Act]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Trotter|first=J.K.|title=Here's Who Voted Against the Violence Against Women Act|url=http://www.theatlanticwire.com/politics/2013/02/heres-who-voted-against-violence-against-women-act/62633/|newspaper=The Atlantic|date=February 28, 2013}}</ref>

===Leadership race===
In the aftermath of Rep. [[Eric Cantor]]'s unexpected defeat by [[David Brat]] on June 10, 2014, Scalise launched a campaign to replace Rep. [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] in the position of [[Majority Whip]] of the House; McCarthy himself would replace Cantor as House Majority Leader. Scalise's ascent to leadership built on his "come-from-behind win in 2012 to become chairman" of the [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>Joachim, David S., [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/us/politics/steve-scalise-of-louisiana-gets-lift-from-fellow-southern-lawmakers.html "Louisianan Seeks to Extend Rapid Rise in House G.O.P."], New York ''Times'', June 19, 2014.

==Political campaigns==
===2008 special election===
{{main|Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 2008}}
In 2004, Scalise announced that he would run for the U.S. House but thereafter deferred to the preference of party leaders and supported Jindal, who won the position vacated by the successful U.S. senatorial candidate, [[David Vitter]].

In 2007, when Jindal was elected to the governorship of Louisiana, Scalise announced his intentions to seek the seat yet again. This time he received Republican party backing.

Scalise's strongest Republican primary opponent, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Timothy Burns (Louisiana politician)|Timothy G. "Tim" Burns]] from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] in [[St. Tammany Parish]], accused Scalise of [[push polling]], a practice in which a campaign contacts voters by telephone and asks probing questions which leave a negative impression of his opponent. Scalise defended his poll from criticism by Burns: "We were running a public opinion survey this week conducted by the largest Republican polling firm in the country, Public Opinion Strategies. . . . conducted with a sample of 300 people, and it shows Scalise at 57 percent, Burns at 26 percent and undecided at 17 percent The margin of error is 5.6 percent. We ran a fact-based public opinion survey, not a push poll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1205560202224150.xml&coll=1 |title=Scalise defends integrity of GOP runoff survey |publisher=NOLA.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> 

In the March 8, 2008, Republican primary, Scalise polled 16,799 votes (48 percent). He went on to win the [[runoff election]] on April 5 against Burns, who received 9,631 votes (28 percent) in the initial primary.<ref name="Runoff"/><ref name="Runoff">[http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/040508state.htm Louisiana Secretary of State Unofficial Election Results Inquiry Results for Election Date: 4/05/08]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/ |title='&#39;'nola.com'&#39;' ELECTIONS section |publisher=Nola.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref>

In the May 3 general election, Scalise received 33,867 votes (75.13 percent) to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Gilda Reed's 10,142 ballots (22.5 percent). Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.36 percent of the vote. Reed was a favorite of [[organized labor]] and the Democratic constituency groups. The First District has been Republican since 1977, when [[Bob Livingston]] won a special election.<ref>[http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&rqsdta=050308 Louisiana Secretary of State-Multi-Parish Elections Inquiry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Scalise was sworn in on May 7, 2008.

===2008===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2008#District 1}}
In the regularly scheduled election, Scalise was reelected over Democrat Jim Harlan, 66 percent to 34 percent.

===2010===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2010#District 1}}
Scalise defeated the Democratic nominee, Myron Katz, and an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]], Arden Wells, in his 2010 bid for reelection.

===2012===
In June 2009, Scalise joined [[Dan Kyle]], the former legislative auditor and the treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, as directors of a national [[U.S. President|presidential]] fund-raising effort promoting Governor Jindal. According to Kyle, the group hoped to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination.<ref name=jindal>{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/48123092.html|title=Michelle Millhollon, "Official pulls out of Jindal group", June 16, 2009|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}</ref> Others on the committee include former State Representative [[Woody Jenkins]]. Former Republican [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Tom Schedler]] of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role at the time as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]].<ref name=jindal/> In 2010, Schedler succeeded Dardenne as secretary of state.

In his own 2012 congressional race, Scalise prevailed with 193,490 votes (66.6 percent) over four opponents, the strongest of which was the Democrat M. V. "Vinny" Mendoza, who finished with 61,979 votes (21.3 percent). A second Republican, Gary King, received 24,838 votes (8.6 percent). Independent Arden Wells ran again and received 4,285 votes (1.5 percent) in his second race against Scalise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Legislation==
Scalise sponsored a bill called the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act. The bill makes the [[Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]] consolidate several of their reports into one report. The bill is expected to help streamline the FCC's work and make the agency more efficient.<ref>Harrison, Julie, [http://riponadvance.com/news/scalises-fcc-consolidation-bill-sails-through-house/4712 "Scalise‚Äôs FCC consolidation bill sails through House"], ''The Ripon Advance'', 9-12-13.

In 2014, political blogger Lamar White, Jr. researched forum posts on white supremacist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and discovered that in 2002 Scalise had spoken at a conference organized by a white supremacist group.<ref name=Calderone>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/lamar-white-jr-scalise-blogger_n_6397078.html | title=How Louisiana Blogger Lamar White, Jr. Landed The Steve Scalise White Supremacist Scoop | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=December 30, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Calderone, Michael}}</ref> White, a law student, posted his findings on his blog, CenLamar.com.

Kenny Knight and his former girlfriend, Barbara Noble, said that Scalise did not speak at the EURO conference, but at a meeting of the Jefferson Heights Civic Association. The association met in the same location as the EURO conference, several hours before the conference began. According to Knight, a representative of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and a member of the Red Cross also spoke to attendees, who were mainly residents from Knight and Scalise's neighborhood. Knight says he invited Scalise because, ‚ÄúI wanted to reach out to him and give him an audience so he could talk to people from his district about legislation he was proposing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/kenny_knight_and_barbara_noble_claim_steve_scalise_never_spoke_to_euro_did.html|title=White Noise Did Steve Scalise Admit to Speaking at a White Supremacist Event He Never Attended?|work=Slate|date=December 31, 2014| accessdate=January 1, 2015| author=Woodruff, Betty}}</ref>  The EURO press release advertising the 2002 conference did not list Scalise as a speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/steve-scalise-not-mentioned-speaker-2002-press-release-white-supremacist-group_822604.html|title= Steve Scalise Not Mentioned As Speaker in 2002 Press Release By White Supremacist Group|publisher=Weekly Standard|date=31 Dec 2014| accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> 

On December 29, Niels Lesniewski of ''[[Roll Call]]'' reprinted an article that had been run in 1999, after Congressman [[Bob Livingston]] had resigned from Congress. Duke and Scalise were considering running for his seat and they and others were interviewed for the piece. When asked about a potential bid for Congress by Duke, Scalise had told the newspaper that he held many of the same conservative views as Duke, but was a more electable candidate, saying that Duke's novelty had worn off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/scalise-vitter-talked-to-roll-call-about-david-duke-in-1999/|title=What Scalise and Vitter Told Roll Call About David Duke in 1999|work=Roll Call|author=Niels Lesniewski|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref> Two days later, Louisiana political reporter Stephanie Grace recounted that during her first meeting with Scalise two decades ago, he had told her that he was "like David Duke without the baggage", baggage which Grace described as "Duke‚Äôs past, his racist and anti-Semitic views and his former role as a KKK grand wizard."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/state/11213737-123/stephanie-grace-scalises-pitch-to|title=Stephanie Grace: Scalise‚Äôs pitch to Duke supporters seems plausible|work=New Orleans Advocate|author=Stephanie Grace|date=December 31, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref>

'''Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise''' (born October 6, 1965) is the current [[United States House of Representatives]] Majority Whip and representative for {{ushr|LA|1}}, serving since 2008.

Prior to his congressional tenure, Scalise served for four months in the [[Louisiana State Senate]] and twelve years in the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]]. On June 19, 2014, Scalise was elected by his Republican colleagues to serve as [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives]]. He assumed office on August 1. He is the first Louisianan in the Majority Whip's position since [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Hale Boggs]] of [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]] held the position from 1962 to 1971.

In 2014, controversy arose after Scalise acknowledged that in 2002 he had spoken at a meeting of a [[white supremacist]] group founded by [[David Duke]].

==Early life==
Stephen Joseph "Steve" Scalise is the son of Alfred J. Scalise and Carol Schilleci Scalise. After his mother's death, his father remarried and Maggie Penfold Scalise became his stepmother.<ref name=marriageannouncement1 />

Scalise graduated from [[Archbishop Rummel High School]] in [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]] in [[Jefferson Parish, Louisiana|Jefferson Parish]] and earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree from [[Louisiana State University]] in [[Baton Rouge]], with a major in [[computer programming]] and a minor in [[political science]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pierce|first1=Charles|title=Home / Blogs / The Politics Blog The Politics Blog The Republicans' New Debt Ceiling "Menu"|url=http://www.esquire.com/blogs/politics/paul-ryan-debt-ceiling-menu-070813|accessdate=8 December 2014|publisher=Esquire|date=July 8, 2013}}</ref>

==Louisiana Legislature==
Scalise was elected three times to the [[Louisiana House of Representatives]] in 1995, 1999, and 2003.  He initially succeeded fellow Republican Representative [[Quentin Dastugue|Quentin D. Dastugue]], who made an ill-fated bid for [[governor of Louisiana|governor]] in the 1995 primary. 

His legislative peers named him to the House Appropriations Committee as the representative of the First Congressional District. Scalise opposed the 2002 [[Stelly Plan]], a proposal by [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]] Representative [[Vic Stelly]], since [[repeal]]ed, to reduce certain [[state sales tax]]es on food for home consumption and utilities in exchange for higher [[state income tax]]es.

Scalise was elected in the October 20, 2007, [[jungle primary|nonpartisan blanket primary]] to the District 9 seat in the [[Louisiana Senate]] vacated by the term-limited [[Ken Hollis]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]]. Scalise received 19,154 votes (61 percent) in a three-way contest. Fellow Republican Polly Thomas polled 8,948 votes (29 percent). A Democrat, David Gereighty, polled 3,154 votes (10 percent) in the heavily Republican-oriented district. Scalise was succeeded in the state House by his aide, [[Cameron Henry]] of [[Metairie, Louisiana|Metairie]].

In the special election on November 4, 2008 to fill the remaining three and one-half years in Scalise's state Senate term, [[Conrad Appel]] defeated Polly Thomas, 21,853 (52.1 percent) to 20,065 (47.9 percent). Thomas had also lost the race for the seat in 2007 to Scalise.<ref>Louisiana Secretary of State, November 4, 2008, election results: http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms3&rqsdta=110408</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

On being asked by the ''[[New Orleans Times-Picayune]]'' to assign [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Barack Obama]] a letter grade for Obama's first 100 days as [[President of the United States|President]], Scalise awarded the new president an ''L'' (for "[[Modern liberalism in the United States#"Liberal" as a derogatory epithet|liberal]]").<ref>Tilove, Jonathan, "Obama's first 100 days are graded on a curve" in ''Times-Picayune'' (New Orleans), 2009 April 29, Saint Tammany Edition, pp. A1, A6 (web version =  [http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2009/04/louisianas_congressional_deleg.html Louisiana's congressional delegation grades President Obama's first 100 days from A to L.)]</ref>

In 2011, Scalise became a co-sponsor of Bill H.R.3261 otherwise known as the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] (withdrawn Jan 23, 2012).<ref name="govtrack">[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-3261 Bill H.R.3261]; GovTrack.us;</ref> As chairman of the Republican Study Committee, Scalise dismissed [[Derek Khanna]], a committee staffer, in December 2012 because of pressure from content industry lobbyists after the study committee published a memo advocating [[copyright]] reform.<ref>{{cite news | first = Timothy B. | last = Lee | title = Staffer axed by Republican group over retracted copyright-reform memo | date = December 6, 2012 | publisher = [[Cond√© Nast Publications]] | url = http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2012/12/staffer-axed-by-republican-group-over-retracted-copyright-reform-memo/ | work = [[Ars Technica]] | accessdate = December 8, 2012}}</ref>

===Leadership race===
In the aftermath of Rep. [[Eric Cantor]]'s unexpected defeat by [[David Brat]] on June 10, 2014, Scalise launched a campaign to replace Rep. [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] in the position of [[Majority Whip]] of the House; McCarthy himself would replace Cantor as House Majority Leader. Scalise's ascent to leadership built on his "come-from-behind win in 2012 to become chairman" of the [[Republican Study Committee]].<ref>Joachim, David S., [http://www.nytimes.com/2014/06/20/us/politics/steve-scalise-of-louisiana-gets-lift-from-fellow-southern-lawmakers.html "Louisianan Seeks to Extend Rapid Rise in House G.O.P."], New York ''Times'', June 19, 2014.

==Political campaigns==
===2008 special election===
{{main|Louisiana's 1st congressional district special election, 2008}}
In 2004, Scalise announced that he would run for the U.S. House but thereafter deferred to the preference of party leaders and supported Jindal, who won the position vacated by the successful U.S. senatorial candidate, [[David Vitter]].

In 2007, when Jindal was elected to the governorship of Louisiana, Scalise announced his intentions to seek the seat yet again. This time he received Republican party backing.

Scalise's strongest Republican primary opponent, [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] [[Timothy Burns (Louisiana politician)|Timothy G. "Tim" Burns]] from [[Mandeville, Louisiana|Mandeville]] in [[St. Tammany Parish]], accused Scalise of [[push polling]], a practice in which a campaign contacts voters by telephone and asks probing questions which leave a negative impression of his opponent. Scalise defended his poll from criticism by Burns: "We were running a public opinion survey this week conducted by the largest Republican polling firm in the country, Public Opinion Strategies. . . . conducted with a sample of 300 people, and it shows Scalise at 57 percent, Burns at 26 percent and undecided at 17 percent The margin of error is 5.6 percent. We ran a fact-based public opinion survey, not a push poll."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/news/t-p/capital/index.ssf?/base/news-5/1205560202224150.xml&coll=1 |title=Scalise defends integrity of GOP runoff survey |publisher=NOLA.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref> 

In the March 8, 2008, Republican primary, Scalise polled 16,799 votes (48 percent). He went on to win the [[runoff election]] on April 5 against Burns, who received 9,631 votes (28 percent) in the initial primary.<ref name="Runoff"/><ref name="Runoff">[http://electionresults.sos.louisiana.gov/040508state.htm Louisiana Secretary of State Unofficial Election Results Inquiry Results for Election Date: 4/05/08]</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nola.com/ |title='&#39;'nola.com'&#39;' ELECTIONS section |publisher=Nola.com |date= |accessdate=2014-06-07}}</ref>

In the May 3 general election, Scalise received 33,867 votes (75.13 percent) to [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Gilda Reed's 10,142 ballots (22.5 percent). Two minor candidates polled the remaining 2.36 percent of the vote. Reed was a favorite of [[organized labor]] and the Democratic constituency groups. The First District has been Republican since 1977, when [[Bob Livingston]] won a special election.<ref>[http://www400.sos.louisiana.gov:8090/cgibin/?rqstyp=elcms2&rqsdta=050308 Louisiana Secretary of State-Multi-Parish Elections Inquiry<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Scalise was sworn in on May 7, 2008.

===2008===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2008#District 1}}
In the regularly scheduled election, Scalise was reelected over Democrat Jim Harlan, 66 percent to 34 percent.

===2010===
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2010#District 1}}
Scalise defeated the Democratic nominee, Myron Katz, and an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]], Arden Wells, in his 2010 bid for reelection.

===2012===
In June 2009, Scalise joined [[Dan Kyle]], the former legislative auditor and the treasurer of the Louisiana GOP, as directors of a national [[U.S. President|presidential]] fund-raising effort promoting Governor Jindal. According to Kyle, the group hoped to raise $60 million to persuade Jindal to seek the 2012 party nomination.<ref name=jindal>{{cite web|url=http://www.2theadvocate.com/news/48123092.html|title=Michelle Millhollon, "Official pulls out of Jindal group", June 16, 2009|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]''|accessdate=November 23, 2009}}</ref> Others on the committee include former State Representative [[Woody Jenkins]]. Former Republican [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Senator]] [[Tom Schedler]] of [[Slidell, Louisiana|Slidell]] had his name removed from the group, not because he opposes Jindal but because such fund-raising activity could conflict with Schedler's role at the time as first assistant to Louisiana Secretary of State [[Jay Dardenne]].<ref name=jindal/> In 2010, Schedler succeeded Dardenne as secretary of state.

In his own 2012 congressional race, Scalise prevailed with 193,490 votes (66.6 percent) over four opponents, the strongest of which was the Democrat M. V. "Vinny" Mendoza, who finished with 61,979 votes (21.3 percent). A second Republican, Gary King, received 24,838 votes (8.6 percent). Independent Arden Wells ran again and received 4,285 votes (1.5 percent) in his second race against Scalise.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 11, 2012}}</ref>

==Legislation==
Scalise sponsored a bill called the FCC Consolidated Reporting Act. The bill makes the [[Federal Communications Commission (FCC)]] consolidate several of their reports into one report. The bill is expected to help streamline the FCC's work and make the agency more efficient.<ref>Harrison, Julie, [http://riponadvance.com/news/scalises-fcc-consolidation-bill-sails-through-house/4712 "Scalise‚Äôs FCC consolidation bill sails through House"], ''The Ripon Advance'', 9-12-13.

==EURO controversy==
In 2014, political blogger Lamar White, Jr. researched forum posts on white supremacist website [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]] and discovered that in 2002 Scalise had spoken at a conference organized by a white supremacist group.<ref name=Calderone>{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/30/lamar-white-jr-scalise-blogger_n_6397078.html | title=How Louisiana Blogger Lamar White, Jr. Landed The Steve Scalise White Supremacist Scoop | work=[[Huffington Post]] | date=December 30, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Calderone, Michael}}</ref> White, a law student, posted his findings on his blog, CenLamar.com. Soon after media took note, Scalise said that, while serving in the state legislature in 2002, he had spoken at [[European-American Unity and Rights Organization]] (EURO), a group founded by former [[Ku Klux Klan]] leader [[David Duke]].<ref name=Costa-141229>{{cite web | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/house-majority-whip-scalise-confirms-he-spoke-to-white-nationalists-in-2002/2014/12/29/7f80dc14-8fa3-11e4-a900-9960214d4cd7_story.html | title=House Majority Whip Scalise confirms he spoke to white nationalists in 2002 | work=Washington Post | accessdate=29 December 2014 | author=Costa, Robert}}</ref><ref name=Jaffe>{{cite web | url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/12/29/politics/steve-scalise-white-supremacist-group-speech/ | title=GOP leadership stands by Scalise after white supremacist speech | work=CNN | date=December 31, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Jaffe, Alexandra and Walsh, Deirdra}}</ref><ref name=Sarlin>{{cite web | url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/gop-leader-steve-scalise-may-have-addressed-supremacist-rally | title=GOP leader Steve Scalise may have addressed supremacist conference | work=MSNBC | date=December 29, 2014 | accessdate=December 29, 2014 | author=Sarlin, Benjy}}</ref><ref name="Reilly">{{cite web | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/29/steve-scalise-euro-conference_n_6392036.html | title=House Majority Whip Steve Scalise Spoke At White Supremacist Conference In 2002 | work=The Huffington Post | date=December 29, 2014 | accessdate=December 29, 2014 | author=Reilly, Mollie and Grim, Ryan}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://cenlamar.com/2014/12/28/house-majority-whip-steve-scalise-was-reportedly-an-honored-guest-at-2002-international-white-supremacist-convention/|title=House Majority Whip Steve Scalise Was Reportedly an Honored Guest at 2002 International White Supremacist Convention|publisher=|accessdate=29 December 2014}}</ref> Scalise said that he did not know of the "racist nature of the group" when he spoke at the conference in 2002.<ref name=Martin>{{cite web | url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/31/us/politics/scalises-speech-to-white-supremacist-group-clouds-republicans-plans.html | title=Republicans Try to Fix Damage Scalise‚Äôs 2002 Speech Could Do in 2016 | work=[[New York Times]] | date=December 31, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Martin, jonathan and Calmes, Jackie}}</ref>

In 2008, Scalise received $1,000 from David Duke's adviser, Kenny Knight. <ref name=Lavendar1>{{cite news|last1=Lavendar|first1=Paige|title=Longtime Adviser To David Duke Donated To Steve Scalise|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/31/kenny-knight-steve-scalise_n_6400636.html|accessdate=31 December 2014|publisher=Huffington Post|date=31 Dec 2014}}</ref><ref name=Nichols>{{cite web | url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/193961/steve-scalises-problem-republican-partys-problem | title=Steve Scalise‚Äôs Problem Is the Republican Party‚Äôs Problem | work=[[The Nation]] | date=December 31, 2014 | accessdate=December 31, 2014 | author=Nichols, John}}</ref>

Kenny Knight and his former girlfriend, Barbara Noble, said that Scalise did not speak at the EURO conference, but at a meeting of the Jefferson Heights Civic Association. The association met in the same location as the EURO conference, several hours before the conference began. According to Knight, a representative of the Jefferson Parish Sheriff's Office and a member of the Red Cross also spoke to attendees, who were mainly residents from Knight and Scalise's neighborhood. Knight says he invited Scalise because, ‚ÄúI wanted to reach out to him and give him an audience so he could talk to people from his district about legislation he was proposing."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/politics/2014/12/kenny_knight_and_barbara_noble_claim_steve_scalise_never_spoke_to_euro_did.html|title=White Noise Did Steve Scalise Admit to Speaking at a White Supremacist Event He Never Attended?|work=Slate|date=December 31, 2014| accessdate=January 1, 2015| author=Woodruff, Betty}}</ref>  The EURO press release advertising the 2002 conference did not list Scalise as a speaker.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/steve-scalise-not-mentioned-speaker-2002-press-release-white-supremacist-group_822604.html|title= Steve Scalise Not Mentioned As Speaker in 2002 Press Release By White Supremacist Group|publisher=Weekly Standard|date=31 Dec 2014| accessdate=January 1, 2015}}</ref> 

On December 29, Niels Lesniewski of ''[[Roll Call]]'' reprinted an article that had been run in 1999, after Congressman [[Bob Livingston]] had resigned from Congress. Duke and Scalise were considering running for his seat and they and others were interviewed for the piece. When asked about a potential bid for Congress by Duke, Scalise had told the newspaper that he held many of the same conservative views as Duke, but was a more electable candidate, saying that Duke's novelty had worn off.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/scalise-vitter-talked-to-roll-call-about-david-duke-in-1999/|title=What Scalise and Vitter Told Roll Call About David Duke in 1999|work=Roll Call|author=Niels Lesniewski|date=December 29, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref> Two days later, Louisiana political reporter Stephanie Grace recounted that during her first meeting with Scalise two decades ago, he had told her that he was "like David Duke without the baggage", baggage which Grace described as "Duke‚Äôs past, his racist and anti-Semitic views and his former role as a KKK grand wizard."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theneworleansadvocate.com/news/state/11213737-123/stephanie-grace-scalises-pitch-to|title=Stephanie Grace: Scalise‚Äôs pitch to Duke supporters seems plausible|work=New Orleans Advocate|author=Stephanie Grace|date=December 31, 2014|accessdate=December 31, 2014}}</ref>
