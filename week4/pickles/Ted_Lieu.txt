Proponents of the ban cited sources including several reports of the [[American Psychological Association]] that found that conversion therapy presented a serious health risk "including confusion, depression, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, shame, social withdrawal, suicidality, substance abuse, stress, disappointment, self-blame, decreased self-esteem and authenticity to others, increased self-hatred, hostility and blame toward parents, feelings of anger and betrayal, loss of friends and potential romantic partners, problems in sexual and emotional intimacy, sexual dysfunction, high-risk sexual behaviors, a feeling of being dehumanized and untrue to self, a loss of faith, and a sense of having wasted time and resources." <ref>{{cite web |title=SB-1172 Sexual orientation change efforts. |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov:80/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1172| |publisher=[[California State Legislature]] |work=Leginfo |year=2011–2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>

This bill passed both the State Assembly and Senate with substantial support, and was signed into law by Governor Jerry Brown in 2012.<ref>{{cite news|title= California bans gay-to-straight 'conversion' therapy for minors |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2012/10/california-first-state-to-ban-gay-to-straight-conversion-therapy.html| newspaper= LA times |date=October 1, 2012}}</ref> This made California the first U.S. state to have such a ban. Proponents of the ban cited sources including several reports of the [[American Psychological Association]] that found that conversion therapy presented a serious health risk "including confusion, depression, guilt, helplessness, hopelessness, shame, social withdrawal, suicidality, substance abuse, stress, disappointment, self-blame, decreased self-esteem and authenticity to others, increased self-hatred, hostility and blame toward parents, feelings of anger and betrayal, loss of friends and potential romantic partners, problems in sexual and emotional intimacy, sexual dysfunction, high-risk sexual behaviors, a feeling of being dehumanized and untrue to self, a loss of faith, and a sense of having wasted time and resources." <ref>{{cite web |title=SB-1172 Sexual orientation change efforts. |url=http://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov:80/faces/billNavClient.xhtml?bill_id=201120120SB1172| |publisher=[[California State Legislature]] |work=Leginfo |year=2011–2012 |accessdate=February 5, 2014}}</ref>
