==Controversies==
On Aug. 4th 2014, on an Indianapolis radio program, while discussing the [[2014 American immigration crisis]] Rokita expressed concerns about the ability of border patrol agents to properly process and screen individuals entering the country illegally.  He stated that “from a public-health standpoint” that we “need to know the condition of these kids” while citing the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] as a news event that shows how rapidly diseases can spread.  In response to reports stating that Rokita believed that illegal immigrants are carrying Ebola, he clarified that “the sudden spread of Ebola in Africa is merely one example of how we must take deliberate care to prevent an outbreak of any type of disease inside our borders.”<ref>http://rokita.house.gov/press-release/rokita-response-column-border-crisis</ref> Rokita also cited news reports indicating that nationals from 75 different countries had been apprehended between 2010 and 2014 illegally crossing the [[Mexico–United States border]].<ref>https://soundcloud.com/93wibc/garrison8-4-final</ref>

In October 2013 during the American government shutdown, Rokita was interviewed by CNN journalist Carol Costello.

"I think there are greater issues &mdash; education, health, economics for the black community &mdash; that are more important than us spending all this time on a slip of the lip. I do believe that we all make mistakes (and) that if we expect to be forgiven, we need to forgive."

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Indiana, 2010#District 4}}
On February 1, 2010, three days after Congressman [[Steve Buyer]] of {{ushr|Indiana|4}} said that he would retire at the end of his term, Rokita posted an announcement on [[Facebook]] making clear his intentions to run for the open seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jconline.com/article/20100202/ELECTION01/2020334|title=Hershman, Rokita among growing field for Buyer's seat|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2010|work=[[Journal & Courier]]|first=Mary Beth|last=Schneider}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Buyer's announcement touched off a free-for-all among area Republicans to succeed him.  Ultimately,  thirteen candidates entered the Republican primary, including Rokita.

It was taken for granted that whoever won the primary would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman.

Rokita won the primary with 42 percent of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 68.6% of the vote.

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Indiana, 2010#District 4}}
On February 1, 2010, three days after Congressman [[Steve Buyer]] of {{ushr|Indiana|4}} said that he would retire at the end of his term, Rokita posted an announcement on [[Facebook]] making clear his intentions to run for the open seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jconline.com/article/20100202/ELECTION01/2020334|title=Hershman, Rokita among growing field for Buyer's seat|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2010|work=[[Journal & Courier]]|first=Mary Beth|last=Schneider}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Buyer's announcement touched off a free-for-all among area Republicans to succeed him.  Ultimately,  thirteen candidates entered the Republican primary, including Rokita.  With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+14, the 4th is one of the most Republican districts in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and tied for the second-most Republican in the state (behind the 5th District).  It was taken for granted that whoever won the primary would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman.

Rokita won the primary with 42 percent of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 68.6% of the vote.

When Rokita was elected to office in 2002 at the age of 32, he became at the time the youngest [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] in the [[United States]].

==Early life, education and career==
Rokita grew up in [[Munster, Indiana|Munster]], located in [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County]] in [[Northwest Indiana]]. Rokita attended [[Munster High School]].<ref name="Franklin">{{cite web | url=http://www.nwitimes.com/news/local/lake/munster/munster-speech-team-takes-top-state-honors-for-lucky-th/article_f446a3fe-f6ab-5890-8d6d-6f7cf23c53eb.html | title=Munster speech team takes top state honors for lucky 13th time | date=17 May 2012 | accessdate=17 January 2014 | author=Franklin, Lu Ann}}</ref> He holds a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree from [[Wabash College]] in [[Crawfordsville, Indiana]], where he was an [[Eli Lilly and Company|Eli Lilly]] Fellow.

Rokita was a practicing attorney. In 1997 he joined the secretary of state's office as general counsel. He later became deputy secretary of state.<ref name="vote-in.org">{{cite web|url=http://vote-in.org/Intro.aspx?State=IN&Id=INRokitaTodd |title=Vote In biographical profile of Todd Rokita |publisher=Vote-in.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>

==Indiana Secretary of State==
Rokita was elected by his peers nationally to serve on the nine-member federal executive board of the Election Assistance Commission.<ref name="vote-in.org" /> The commission is charged by law to address election reform issues on a nation-wide basis. Rokita has testified about Indiana's voting reform efforts before the United States Congress.

Rokita was a named defendant in the Hoosier State's voter identification case went before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on January 9, 2008; the combined cases of ''[[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board]]'' (07-21) and ''[[Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita]]'' (07-25) involved the Indiana voting requirement laws that require voters display state-issued photo IDs before voting. In April 2008, the US Supreme Court upheld that law. Rokita also served as Indiana's chief [[securities fraud]] investigator.

As secretary of state, Rokita visited each of Indiana's ninety-two counties at least once per year. Rokita was named as one of the "40 under 40" by the ''Indianapolis Business Journal''.{{When|date=April 2011}} Rokita was active in the [[National Association of Secretaries of State]] (NASS), and after serving as the elected treasurer, he became the President for the 2007-2008 term.<ref>{{cite web|author=InsideINdianaBusiness.com Report |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=24474 |title=Rokita Becomes President of National Association of Secretaries of State - Newsroom - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2007-07-18 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

In September 2009, Rokita outlined a plan to reform how Indiana's legislative districts are drawn to reduce [[gerrymandering]]. He proposed making it a felony for lawmakers to use political data or incumbents' addresses when drawing electoral maps. [[Indiana's congressional districts]] and districts for the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]] will next be redrawn after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]]. Rokita says boundaries should follow existing county and township lines, and that each of the 50 senate districts should be divided into two house districts, claiming this will lead to more competitive legislative elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20090908/NEWS05/909080333/Lawmakers+draw+line+at+redistricting+plan|title=Lawmakers draw a line at Rokita's redistricting plan|last=Schneider|first=Mary Beth |date=September 8, 2009|work=The Indianapolis Star|accessdate=2009-09-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Controversies==
On Aug. 4th 2014, on an Indianapolis radio program, while discussing the [[2014 American immigration crisis]] Rokita expressed concerns about the ability of border patrol agents to properly process and screen individuals entering the country illegally.  He stated that “from a public-health standpoint” that we “need to know the condition of these kids” while citing the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] as a news event that shows how rapidly diseases can spread.  In response to reports stating that Rokita believed that illegal immigrants are carrying Ebola, he clarified that “the sudden spread of Ebola in Africa is merely one example of how we must take deliberate care to prevent an outbreak of any type of disease inside our borders.”<ref>http://rokita.house.gov/press-release/rokita-response-column-border-crisis</ref> Rokita also cited news reports indicating that nationals from 75 different countries had been apprehended between 2010 and 2014 illegally crossing the [[Mexico–United States border]].<ref>https://soundcloud.com/93wibc/garrison8-4-final</ref>

In October 2013 during the American government shutdown, Rokita was interviewed by CNN journalist Carol Costello. Her pointed questions about Rokita's defense of the shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands of government employees without compensation while he continued to receive his paycheck, were eventually countered with his statement that she was "beautiful but you have to be honest" and that journalists were part of the problem.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fung|first=Katherine|title=Rep. Todd Rokita To CNN's Carol Costello: 'You're Beautiful But You Have To Be Honest'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/03/todd-rokita-carol-costello-cnn-beautiful_n_4036782.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=25 October 2013|date=October 3, 2013}}</ref> The Congressman's office issued a statement that he intended no offense by his comments.

In April 2007, Rokita was speaking at a Republican event, and encouraged Republicans to reach out to African-Americans. He mentioned 90 percent of [[African Americans]] vote [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]], after which he asked, "How can that be? Ninety to ten. Who's the master and who's the slave in that relationship? How can that be healthy?"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/NewStoryPrint.aspx?id=54177 | title =Racist remark angers lawmakers Representative: Secretary of State should apologize | author =Alexandra R.

When Rokita was elected to office in 2002 at the age of 32, he became at the time the youngest [[Secretary of State (U.S. state government)|secretary of state]] in the [[United States]].

==Early life, education and career==
Rokita grew up in [[Munster, Indiana|Munster]], located in [[Lake County, Indiana|Lake County]] in [[Northwest Indiana]].

Rokita was a practicing attorney. In 1997 he joined the secretary of state's office as general counsel. He later became deputy secretary of state.<ref name="vote-in.org">{{cite web|url=http://vote-in.org/Intro.aspx?State=IN&Id=INRokitaTodd |title=Vote In biographical profile of Todd Rokita |publisher=Vote-in.org |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}</ref>

==Indiana Secretary of State==
Rokita was elected by his peers nationally to serve on the nine-member federal executive board of the Election Assistance Commission.<ref name="vote-in.org" /> The commission is charged by law to address election reform issues on a nation-wide basis. Rokita has testified about Indiana's voting reform efforts before the United States Congress.

Rokita was a named defendant in the Hoosier State's voter identification case went before the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on January 9, 2008; the combined cases of ''[[Crawford v. Marion County Election Board]]'' (07-21) and ''[[Indiana Democratic Party v. Rokita]]'' (07-25) involved the Indiana voting requirement laws that require voters display state-issued photo IDs before voting. In April 2008, the US Supreme Court upheld that law. Rokita also served as Indiana's chief [[securities fraud]] investigator.

As secretary of state, Rokita visited each of Indiana's ninety-two counties at least once per year. Rokita was named as one of the "40 under 40" by the ''Indianapolis Business Journal''.{{When|date=April 2011}} Rokita was active in the [[National Association of Secretaries of State]] (NASS), and after serving as the elected treasurer, he became the President for the 2007-2008 term.<ref>{{cite web|author=InsideINdianaBusiness.com Report |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/newsitem.asp?ID=24474 |title=Rokita Becomes President of National Association of Secretaries of State - Newsroom - Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=2007-07-18 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

In September 2009, Rokita outlined a plan to reform how Indiana's legislative districts are drawn to reduce [[gerrymandering]]. He proposed making it a felony for lawmakers to use political data or incumbents' addresses when drawing electoral maps. [[Indiana's congressional districts]] and districts for the [[Indiana Senate]] and [[Indiana House of Representatives]] will next be redrawn after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 Census]]. Rokita says boundaries should follow existing county and township lines, and that each of the 50 senate districts should be divided into two house districts, claiming this will lead to more competitive legislative elections.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/article/20090908/NEWS05/909080333/Lawmakers+draw+line+at+redistricting+plan|title=Lawmakers draw a line at Rokita's redistricting plan|last=Schneider|first=Mary Beth |date=September 8, 2009|work=The Indianapolis Star|accessdate=2009-09-08}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

==Controversies==
On Aug. 4th 2014, on an Indianapolis radio program, while discussing the [[2014 American immigration crisis]] Rokita expressed concerns about the ability of border patrol agents to properly process and screen individuals entering the country illegally.  He stated that “from a public-health standpoint” that we “need to know the condition of these kids” while citing the [[Ebola virus epidemic in West Africa]] as a news event that shows how rapidly diseases can spread.  In response to reports stating that Rokita believed that illegal immigrants are carrying Ebola, he clarified that “the sudden spread of Ebola in Africa is merely one example of how we must take deliberate care to prevent an outbreak of any type of disease inside our borders.”<ref>http://rokita.house.gov/press-release/rokita-response-column-border-crisis</ref> Rokita also cited news reports indicating that nationals from 75 different countries had been apprehended between 2010 and 2014 illegally crossing the [[Mexico–United States border]].<ref>https://soundcloud.com/93wibc/garrison8-4-final</ref>

In October 2013 during the American government shutdown, Rokita was interviewed by CNN journalist Carol Costello. Her pointed questions about Rokita's defense of the shutdown that furloughed hundreds of thousands of government employees without compensation while he continued to receive his paycheck, were eventually countered with his statement that she was "beautiful but you have to be honest" and that journalists were part of the problem.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fung|first=Katherine|title=Rep. Todd Rokita To CNN's Carol Costello: 'You're Beautiful But You Have To Be Honest'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/03/todd-rokita-carol-costello-cnn-beautiful_n_4036782.html|publisher=Huffington Post|accessdate=25 October 2013|date=October 3, 2013}}</ref> The Congressman's office issued a statement that he intended no offense by his comments.

In April 2007, Rokita was speaking at a Republican event, and encouraged Republicans to reach out to African-Americans. He mentioned 90 percent of [[African Americans]] vote [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]], after which he asked, "How can that be? Ninety to ten. Who's the master and who's the slave in that relationship? How can that be healthy?"<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.idsnews.com/news/NewStoryPrint.aspx?id=54177 | title =Racist remark angers lawmakers Representative: Secretary of State should apologize | author =Alexandra R.

Representative [[Vernon Smith (Indiana politician)|Vernon Smith]], D-[[Gary, Indiana|Gary]], told reporters, “He apologized to our satisfaction. We do believe he was sincere in his apology," Smith said. "I think there are greater issues &mdash; education, health, economics for the black community &mdash; that are more important than us spending all this time on a slip of the lip. I do believe that we all make mistakes (and) that if we expect to be forgiven, we need to forgive." During the course of the same private meeting Rokita was told his office should reflect the diversity of the state, at the time of his remarks 89% of the employees in Rokita's office were white. <ref>[http://www.theindychannel.com/news/politics/rokita-apologizes-to-black-lawmakers-for-slave-remark], WRTV-6, April 18, 2007</ref>

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Indiana, 2010#District 4}}
On February 1, 2010, three days after Congressman [[Steve Buyer]] of {{ushr|Indiana|4}} said that he would retire at the end of his term, Rokita posted an announcement on [[Facebook]] making clear his intentions to run for the open seat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jconline.com/article/20100202/ELECTION01/2020334|title=Hershman, Rokita among growing field for Buyer's seat|date=February 2, 2010|accessdate=February 2, 2010|work=[[Journal & Courier]]|first=Mary Beth|last=Schneider}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}</ref>

Buyer's announcement touched off a free-for-all among area Republicans to succeed him.  Ultimately,  thirteen candidates entered the Republican primary, including Rokita.  With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+14, the 4th is one of the most Republican districts in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and tied for the second-most Republican in the state (behind the 5th District).  It was taken for granted that whoever won the primary would be heavily favored to be the district's next congressman.

Rokita won the primary with 42 percent of the vote, and went on to win the general election with 68.6% of the vote.
