===Legislation===
On April 1, 2014, Kline introduced the [[Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization.<ref name=cbo10>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 10|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45276|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=10allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 10 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/10/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> This is intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million.<ref name=BidwellUSNews>{{cite news|last=Bidwell|first=Allie|title=House Steams Ahead on Charter School Expansion|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/09/bipartisan-charter-school-bill-sails-through-house-of-representatives|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=U.S. News and World Report|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> The bill passed in the House on May 7, 2014.<ref name="10allactions"/>

===Political campaigns===
Kline made his first run for office in 1998, when he challenged 6th District [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Bill Luther]] and lost, taking 46% of the vote.  He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the district.

After the 2000 census, Minnesota's congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged.  The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities' southern suburbs.  At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor.  The remapping left the home of the 2nd District's freshman incumbent, Republican [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]], just inside the reconfigured 6th District.  Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district.  After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.

During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the "No New Taxes Party."  This was done in retaliation for an ad the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. <ref>Scheck, Tom. [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200208/22_scheckt_facetoface/ Luther, Kline get heated in TV debate]. [[Minnesota Public Radio]], August 22, 2002.</ref>  Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther's 42%.

Kline then defeated Democratic [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] City Councilwoman [[Teresa Daly]] to win a second term in 2004 and former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]] and [[whistleblower]] [[Coleen Rowley]], one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine's]]'' "Persons of the Year", with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former [[Watertown, Minnesota|Watertown]] mayor [[Steve Sarvi]] and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.

Kline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]]'s PAC. After Cunningham’s indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20051202-9999-1n2giveback.html Some Republicans are dumping donations given by Cunningham] Accessed August 12, 2006</ref>

Kline's reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/07/john_kline_six_going_on_seven.php |title=John Kline: Six Going on Seven? |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=July 18, 2013}}</ref>

===Campaign Financing===

So far during the 2014 campaign, Kline's largest campaign contributor has been the [[Apollo Group]],  an S&P 400 corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions through its subsidiaries, including the [[University of Phoenix]]. The corporation has given $33,100 toward Kline's campaign committee and leadership PAC.<ref>https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&type=C&cid=N00004436&newMem=N&recs=20</ref>

==Flip a district==
In 2014 he was the winner of comedian [[Bill Maher]]'s "Flip a District" contest for the most useless congressman from a group of 16 semi-finalists nominated by viewers nationwide.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/12/bill-maher-announces-hes-targeting-rep-john-kline-he-picked-the-wrong-guy/</ref><ref name=hbo">http://www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher/episodes/12/328-episode/article/new-rules#/</ref>  

Local paper the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported Kline is attempting to raise $100,000 to counteract the notoriety brought by Maher's campaign.  Kline's spokesman said "Minnesotans are tired of sleazy and slimy politics,” but Kline's opponent, “certainly isn’t.”  Kline's opponent [[Mike Obermueller]] reported a 700 percent increase in fundraising.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/john-kline-bill-maher-110998.html</ref>

===Legislation===
On April 1, 2014, Kline introduced the [[Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization.<ref name=cbo10>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 10|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45276|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=10allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 10 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/10/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> This is intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million.<ref name=BidwellUSNews>{{cite news|last=Bidwell|first=Allie|title=House Steams Ahead on Charter School Expansion|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/09/bipartisan-charter-school-bill-sails-through-house-of-representatives|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=U.S. News and World Report|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> The bill passed in the House on May 7, 2014.<ref name="10allactions"/>

===Political campaigns===
Kline made his first run for office in 1998, when he challenged 6th District [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Bill Luther]] and lost, taking 46% of the vote.  He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the district.

After the 2000 census, Minnesota's congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged.  The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities' southern suburbs.  At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor.  The remapping left the home of the 2nd District's freshman incumbent, Republican [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]], just inside the reconfigured 6th District.  Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district.  After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.

During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the "No New Taxes Party."  This was done in retaliation for an ad the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. <ref>Scheck, Tom. [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200208/22_scheckt_facetoface/ Luther, Kline get heated in TV debate]. [[Minnesota Public Radio]], August 22, 2002.</ref>  Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther's 42%.

Kline then defeated Democratic [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] City Councilwoman [[Teresa Daly]] to win a second term in 2004 and former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]] and [[whistleblower]] [[Coleen Rowley]], one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine's]]'' "Persons of the Year", with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former [[Watertown, Minnesota|Watertown]] mayor [[Steve Sarvi]] and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.

Kline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]]'s PAC. After Cunningham’s indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20051202-9999-1n2giveback.html Some Republicans are dumping donations given by Cunningham] Accessed August 12, 2006</ref>

Kline's reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/07/john_kline_six_going_on_seven.php |title=John Kline: Six Going on Seven? |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=July 18, 2013}}</ref>

===Campaign Financing===

So far during the 2014 campaign, Kline's largest campaign contributor has been the [[Apollo Group]],  an S&P 400 corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions through its subsidiaries, including the [[University of Phoenix]]. The corporation has given $33,100 toward Kline's campaign committee and leadership PAC.<ref>https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&type=C&cid=N00004436&newMem=N&recs=20</ref>

==Flip a district==
In 2014 he was the winner of comedian [[Bill Maher]]'s "Flip a District" contest for the most useless congressman from a group of 16 semi-finalists nominated by viewers nationwide.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/12/bill-maher-announces-hes-targeting-rep-john-kline-he-picked-the-wrong-guy/</ref><ref name=hbo">http://www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher/episodes/12/328-episode/article/new-rules#/</ref>  

Local paper the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported Kline is attempting to raise $100,000 to counteract the notoriety brought by Maher's campaign.  Kline's spokesman said "Minnesotans are tired of sleazy and slimy politics,” but Kline's opponent, “certainly isn’t.”  Kline's opponent [[Mike Obermueller]] reported a 700 percent increase in fundraising.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/john-kline-bill-maher-110998.html</ref>

On April 1, 2014, Kline introduced the [[Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization.<ref name=cbo10>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 10|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45276|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=10allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 10 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/10/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> This is intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million.<ref name=BidwellUSNews>{{cite news|last=Bidwell|first=Allie|title=House Steams Ahead on Charter School Expansion|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/09/bipartisan-charter-school-bill-sails-through-house-of-representatives|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=U.S. News and World Report|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> The bill passed in the House on May 7, 2014.<ref name="10allactions"/>

===Political campaigns===
Kline made his first run for office in 1998, when he challenged 6th District [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Bill Luther]] and lost, taking 46% of the vote.  He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the district.

After the 2000 census, Minnesota's congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged.  The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities' southern suburbs.  At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor.  The remapping left the home of the 2nd District's freshman incumbent, Republican [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]], just inside the reconfigured 6th District.  Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district.  After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.

During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the "No New Taxes Party."  This was done in retaliation for an ad the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. <ref>Scheck, Tom. [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200208/22_scheckt_facetoface/ Luther, Kline get heated in TV debate]. [[Minnesota Public Radio]], August 22, 2002.</ref>  Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther's 42%.

Kline then defeated Democratic [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] City Councilwoman [[Teresa Daly]] to win a second term in 2004 and former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]] and [[whistleblower]] [[Coleen Rowley]], one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine's]]'' "Persons of the Year", with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former [[Watertown, Minnesota|Watertown]] mayor [[Steve Sarvi]] and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.

Kline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]]'s PAC. After Cunningham’s indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20051202-9999-1n2giveback.html Some Republicans are dumping donations given by Cunningham] Accessed August 12, 2006</ref>

Kline's reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/07/john_kline_six_going_on_seven.php |title=John Kline: Six Going on Seven? |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=July 18, 2013}}</ref>

===Campaign Financing===

So far during the 2014 campaign, Kline's largest campaign contributor has been the [[Apollo Group]],  an S&P 400 corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions through its subsidiaries, including the [[University of Phoenix]]. The corporation has given $33,100 toward Kline's campaign committee and leadership PAC.<ref>https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&type=C&cid=N00004436&newMem=N&recs=20</ref>

==Flip a district==
In 2014 he was the winner of comedian [[Bill Maher]]'s "Flip a District" contest for the most useless congressman from a group of 16 semi-finalists nominated by viewers nationwide.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/12/bill-maher-announces-hes-targeting-rep-john-kline-he-picked-the-wrong-guy/</ref><ref name=hbo">http://www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher/episodes/12/328-episode/article/new-rules#/</ref>  

Local paper the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported Kline is attempting to raise $100,000 to counteract the notoriety brought by Maher's campaign.  Kline's spokesman said "Minnesotans are tired of sleazy and slimy politics,” but Kline's opponent, “certainly isn’t.”  Kline's opponent [[Mike Obermueller]] reported a 700 percent increase in fundraising.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/john-kline-bill-maher-110998.html</ref>

On April 1, 2014, Kline introduced the [[Success and Opportunity through Quality Charter Schools Act (H.R. 10; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend and [[authorization bill|reauthorize]] both the Charter School Programs and the Credit Enhancement for Charter School Initiatives under Title V of the [[Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965]] through fiscal year 2020 and combine them into a single authorization.<ref name=cbo10>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 10|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45276|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=8 May 2014}}</ref><ref name=10allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 10 - All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/10/all-actions/|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2014}}</ref> This is intended to streamline and improve the grants process and increase the funding for these programs from $250 million to $300 million.<ref name=BidwellUSNews>{{cite news|last=Bidwell|first=Allie|title=House Steams Ahead on Charter School Expansion|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2014/05/09/bipartisan-charter-school-bill-sails-through-house-of-representatives|accessdate=13 May 2014|newspaper=U.S. News and World Report|date=9 May 2014}}</ref> The bill passed in the House on May 7, 2014.<ref name="10allactions"/>

===Political campaigns===
Kline made his first run for office in 1998, when he challenged 6th District [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] incumbent [[Bill Luther]] and lost, taking 46% of the vote.  He sought a rematch in 2000 and lost by only 5,400 votes, while [[George W. Bush]] narrowly carried the district.

After the 2000 census, Minnesota's congressional map was radically altered, though the number of districts was unchanged.  The old 28-county 2nd District was dismantled, and a new 2nd District was created in the Twin Cities' southern suburbs.  At the same time, the 6th District was pushed slightly north and made significantly more Republican than its predecessor.  The remapping left the home of the 2nd District's freshman incumbent, Republican [[Mark Kennedy (politician)|Mark Kennedy]], just inside the reconfigured 6th District.  Realizing this, Kline immediately filed for the Republican nomination in the new 2nd District; his home had been drawn into this district.  After some consideration, Luther opted to run in the 2nd as well, even though it was thought to lean slightly Republican.

During the campaign, Luther came under fire when one of his supporters, Sam Garst, filed for the race under the banner of the "No New Taxes Party."  This was done in retaliation for an ad the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] ran in support of Kline that accused Luther of being soft on crime. <ref>Scheck, Tom. [http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/200208/22_scheckt_facetoface/ Luther, Kline get heated in TV debate]. [[Minnesota Public Radio]], August 22, 2002.</ref>  Kline gained considerable momentum from this, and ultimately won handily, taking 53% of the vote to Luther's 42%.

Kline then defeated Democratic [[Burnsville, Minnesota|Burnsville]] City Councilwoman [[Teresa Daly]] to win a second term in 2004 and former [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] [[Special agent]] and [[whistleblower]] [[Coleen Rowley]], one of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time magazine's]]'' "Persons of the Year", with 56% of the vote in 2006. In 2008 Kline defeated former [[Watertown, Minnesota|Watertown]] mayor [[Steve Sarvi]] and increased his margin of victory to over 57% of the vote.

Kline accepted $11,000 in political contributions from former congressman [[Randy "Duke" Cunningham]]'s PAC. After Cunningham’s indictment on fraud charges, Kline donated the money to charity.<ref>[http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20051202-9999-1n2giveback.html Some Republicans are dumping donations given by Cunningham] Accessed August 12, 2006</ref>

Kline's reelection in 2012 made him the 40th U.S. Representative from Minnesota to win six House terms.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://blog.lib.umn.edu/cspg/smartpolitics/2013/07/john_kline_six_going_on_seven.php |title=John Kline: Six Going on Seven? |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date=July 18, 2013}}</ref>

===Campaign Financing===

So far during the 2014 campaign, Kline's largest campaign contributor has been the [[Apollo Group]],  an S&P 400 corporation that owns several for-profit educational institutions through its subsidiaries, including the [[University of Phoenix]]. The corporation has given $33,100 toward Kline's campaign committee and leadership PAC.<ref>https://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/contrib.php?cycle=2014&type=C&cid=N00004436&newMem=N&recs=20</ref>

==Flip a district==
In 2014 he was the winner of comedian [[Bill Maher]]'s "Flip a District" contest for the most useless congressman from a group of 16 semi-finalists nominated by viewers nationwide.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2014/09/12/bill-maher-announces-hes-targeting-rep-john-kline-he-picked-the-wrong-guy/</ref><ref name=hbo">http://www.hbo.com/real-time-with-bill-maher/episodes/12/328-episode/article/new-rules#/</ref>  

Local paper the ''[[Star Tribune]]'' reported Kline is attempting to raise $100,000 to counteract the notoriety brought by Maher's campaign.  Kline's spokesman said "Minnesotans are tired of sleazy and slimy politics,” but Kline's opponent, “certainly isn’t.”  Kline's opponent [[Mike Obermueller]] reported a 700 percent increase in fundraising.<ref>http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/john-kline-bill-maher-110998.html</ref>
