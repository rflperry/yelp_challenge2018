===Tenure===
Mark Amodei was sworn in on September 15, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/sep/15/mark-amodei-sworn-fill-house-seat/|title=Mark Amodei sworn in to fill House seat|publisher=[[Las Vegas Sun]]|date=September 15, 2011|accessdate=October 5, 2011}}</ref>

Amodei voted against the bill to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]].  Regarding the vote, Amodei stated: "During two campaigns, I told Nevadans I would give my full attention to such issues as reining in runaway federal spending, debt, and the harmful aspects of the Affordable Care Act. Unlike many in this town, I will not test your memories and hope you have forgotten. I will continue to pursue these necessary goals. Nothing in this legislation changes the real threats to our country’s economy."<ref>Nevada's Mark Amodei issues statement on his 'no' vote in US House http://www.rgj.com/article/20131016/NEWS12/131016044/Nevada-s-Mark-Amodei-issues-statement-his-no-vote-U-S-House</ref>
