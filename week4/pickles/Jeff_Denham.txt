==2000 run for State Assembly==
Denham ran for the [[California State Assembly]] against Salinas City Councilman [[Simon Salinas]] as a political novice. Salinas spent $1,270,380 and Denham spent $1,109,466 which combined was one of the more expensive Assembly races of the year.<ref>http://vote2000.sos.ca.gov/Returns/close.html</ref> Salinas defeated Denham by more than 11,000 votes, or almost 9%.<ref>http://vote2000.sos.ca.gov/Returns/stasm/2800.htm</ref>

==California Senate==

===Elections===
;2002
Denham ran for the State Senate in 2002 against former state Assemblyman [[Rusty Areias]]. The election occurred on November 5, 2002 but the close vote count caused the lead in the race to go back and forth for several days.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5192590p-6201114c.html</ref>

The race featured many negative political ads and those negative political ads appear to have allowed Jeff Denham to win against the more experienced Areias.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5148192p-6157185c.html {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> The race was one of the most expensive legislative races in state history with over $6,300,000 dollars spent.<ref name="modbee.com">http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5090148p-6096517c.html</ref> The Denham campaign attacked Areias for outstanding tax liens. Republicans funded waves of campaign literature and television commercials renewing years-old charges against Areias on a variety of subjects.<ref name="modbee.com"/>

Denham won the race 48%-47%, or by 1,843 votes.<ref name="ourcampaigns.com">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=5747</ref><ref>http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2002_general/state_senate.pdf</ref> Denham managed a close victory in a seat where the Democrats had an almost 15% advantage in registration.<ref>http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/sen/senplan/SD12.HTM</ref>

Denham won re-election to a second term with 58% of the vote.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=214061</ref>

;2008 recall attempt
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
During the 2007 Budget Crisis in California, Denham was the Republican that Democrats targeted to gain the necessary votes to pass the budget. In response to Denham's refusal to vote for the budget on the grounds that it wasn't balanced, Senate President Pro Tem [[Don Perata]] demoted Denham from his position as Vice Chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee. At the same time, Perata started working with local Democratic parties in the Central Valley to create a petition to start a [[recall election]] against Denham. The [[California Secretary of State]] certified the petition, and its proponents collected 50,000 signatures before the deadline in February 2008.

On the June 3, 2008 election, the voters opposed the recall by a 76%-24% margin, and Denham continued as State Senator for California's 12th State Senate District.

===Tenure===
During is time in the state legislature, Denham focused his efforts on education, agriculture and job creation.

Denham ran for the [[California State Assembly]] against Salinas City Councilman [[Simon Salinas]] as a political novice. Salinas spent $1,270,380 and Denham spent $1,109,466 which combined was one of the more expensive Assembly races of the year.<ref>http://vote2000.sos.ca.gov/Returns/close.html</ref> Salinas defeated Denham by more than 11,000 votes, or almost 9%.<ref>http://vote2000.sos.ca.gov/Returns/stasm/2800.htm</ref>

==California Senate==

===Elections===
;2002
Denham ran for the State Senate in 2002 against former state Assemblyman [[Rusty Areias]]. The election occurred on November 5, 2002 but the close vote count caused the lead in the race to go back and forth for several days.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5192590p-6201114c.html</ref>

The race featured many negative political ads and those negative political ads appear to have allowed Jeff Denham to win against the more experienced Areias.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5148192p-6157185c.html {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> The race was one of the most expensive legislative races in state history with over $6,300,000 dollars spent.<ref name="modbee.com">http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5090148p-6096517c.html</ref> The Denham campaign attacked Areias for outstanding tax liens. Republicans funded waves of campaign literature and television commercials renewing years-old charges against Areias on a variety of subjects.<ref name="modbee.com"/>

Denham won the race 48%-47%, or by 1,843 votes.<ref name="ourcampaigns.com">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=5747</ref><ref>http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2002_general/state_senate.pdf</ref> Denham managed a close victory in a seat where the Democrats had an almost 15% advantage in registration.<ref>http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/sen/senplan/SD12.HTM</ref>

Denham won re-election to a second term with 58% of the vote.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=214061</ref>

;2008 recall attempt
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
During the 2007 Budget Crisis in California, Denham was the Republican that Democrats targeted to gain the necessary votes to pass the budget. In response to Denham's refusal to vote for the budget on the grounds that it wasn't balanced, Senate President Pro Tem [[Don Perata]] demoted Denham from his position as Vice Chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee. At the same time, Perata started working with local Democratic parties in the Central Valley to create a petition to start a [[recall election]] against Denham. The [[California Secretary of State]] certified the petition, and its proponents collected 50,000 signatures before the deadline in February 2008.

On the June 3, 2008 election, the voters opposed the recall by a 76%-24% margin, and Denham continued as State Senator for California's 12th State Senate District.

During is time in the state legislature, Denham focused his efforts on education, agriculture and job creation.

Denham ran for the [[California State Assembly]] against Salinas City Councilman [[Simon Salinas]] as a political novice.

==California Senate==

===Elections===
;2002
Denham ran for the State Senate in 2002 against former state Assemblyman [[Rusty Areias]]. The election occurred on November 5, 2002 but the close vote count caused the lead in the race to go back and forth for several days.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5192590p-6201114c.html</ref>

The race featured many negative political ads and those negative political ads appear to have allowed Jeff Denham to win against the more experienced Areias.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5148192p-6157185c.html {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> The race was one of the most expensive legislative races in state history with over $6,300,000 dollars spent.<ref name="modbee.com">http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5090148p-6096517c.html</ref> The Denham campaign attacked Areias for outstanding tax liens. Republicans funded waves of campaign literature and television commercials renewing years-old charges against Areias on a variety of subjects.<ref name="modbee.com"/>

Denham won the race 48%-47%, or by 1,843 votes.<ref name="ourcampaigns.com">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=5747</ref><ref>http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2002_general/state_senate.pdf</ref> Denham managed a close victory in a seat where the Democrats had an almost 15% advantage in registration.<ref>http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/sen/senplan/SD12.HTM</ref>

;2006
Denham won re-election to a second term with 58% of the vote.<ref name="ReferenceA">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=214061</ref>

;2008 recall attempt
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
During the 2007 Budget Crisis in California, Denham was the Republican that Democrats targeted to gain the necessary votes to pass the budget. In response to Denham's refusal to vote for the budget on the grounds that it wasn't balanced, Senate President Pro Tem [[Don Perata]] demoted Denham from his position as Vice Chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee. At the same time, Perata started working with local Democratic parties in the Central Valley to create a petition to start a [[recall election]] against Denham. The [[California Secretary of State]] certified the petition, and its proponents collected 50,000 signatures before the deadline in February 2008.

On the June 3, 2008 election, the voters opposed the recall by a 76%-24% margin, and Denham continued as State Senator for California's 12th State Senate District.

===Tenure===
During is time in the state legislature, Denham focused his efforts on education, agriculture and job creation. He called for a reduction in government waste in Sacramento, better use of state surplus assets and a crackdown on sexual predators.<ref name="Path to Power">{{cite news|title=Jeff Denham Path to Power|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jeff-denham-r-calif/gIQA6BMZKP_topic.html#path-to-power|work=WhoRunsGov|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 21, 2012}}</ref>

==California Senate==

===Elections===
;2002
Denham ran for the State Senate in 2002 against former state Assemblyman [[Rusty Areias]]. The election occurred on November 5, 2002 but the close vote count caused the lead in the race to go back and forth for several days.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5192590p-6201114c.html</ref>

The race featured many negative political ads and those negative political ads appear to have allowed Jeff Denham to win against the more experienced Areias.<ref>http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5148192p-6157185c.html {{dead link|date=May 2014}}</ref> The race was one of the most expensive legislative races in state history with over $6,300,000 dollars spent.<ref name="modbee.com">http://www.modbee.com/2002/election/november/state/story/5090148p-6096517c.html</ref> The Denham campaign attacked Areias for outstanding tax liens. Republicans funded waves of campaign literature and television commercials renewing years-old charges against Areias on a variety of subjects.<ref name="modbee.com"/>

Denham won the race 48%-47%, or by 1,843 votes.<ref name="ourcampaigns.com">http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=5747</ref><ref>http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2002_general/state_senate.pdf</ref> Denham managed a close victory in a seat where the Democrats had an almost 15% advantage in registration.<ref>http://www.sen.ca.gov/ftp/sen/senplan/SD12.HTM</ref>

;2008 recall attempt
{{BLP unsourced section|date=September 2014}}
During the 2007 Budget Crisis in California, Denham was the Republican that Democrats targeted to gain the necessary votes to pass the budget. In response to Denham's refusal to vote for the budget on the grounds that it wasn't balanced, Senate President Pro Tem [[Don Perata]] demoted Denham from his position as Vice Chairman of the Senate Governmental Organization Committee. At the same time, Perata started working with local Democratic parties in the Central Valley to create a petition to start a [[recall election]] against Denham. The [[California Secretary of State]] certified the petition, and its proponents collected 50,000 signatures before the deadline in February 2008.

On the June 3, 2008 election, the voters opposed the recall by a 76%-24% margin, and Denham continued as State Senator for California's 12th State Senate District.
