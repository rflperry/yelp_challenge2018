==Early political career==
On November 7, 2000, Guinta was elected to a seat in the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]], representing [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. He was re-elected on November 5, 2002.

In 2001, Guinta ran for the post of [[alderman]] from Manchester's Ward 3. In the non-partisan municipal primary election held on 1 September 2001,<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Results -- City Of Manchester -- Non-Partisan Municipal Primary Election, September 1, 2001|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Portals/2/Departments/city_clerk/elections/Sept.%2018,%202001%20Municipal%20Primary%20Results.pdf|publisher=Manchester, New Hampshire Office of the City Clerk|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref> Guinta and George Skilioganis were the two top vote-getters in Ward 3, with 375 and 279 votes, respectively, securing them a place on the November ballot. On 6 November 2001, Guinta defeated Skilioganis by a vote of 630 to 522 in the general election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Results -- City Of Manchester -- Non-Partisan Municipal General Election, November 6, 2001|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Ylx9KNhuJ_0%3d&tabid=585|publisher=Manchester, New Hampshire Office of the City Clerk|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>

Two years later incumbent alderman Guinta and the challenger Glenn R.J. Ouellette, a runner-up in the 2001 primary, faced no opposition in the primary. In the 3 November 2003 general election, Guinta beat Ouellete 452 to 324.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Results -- City Of Manchester -- Non-Partisan Municipal General Election, November 3, 2003|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Portals/2/Departments/city_clerk/elections/Nov%2003%20Official%20Results.pdf|publisher=Manchester, New Hampshire Office of the City Clerk|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref> While serving as alderman, Guinta was one of the few Republicans on the 14-member Board of Alderman. The mayor of Manchester during Guinta's tenure on the board, [[Robert A. Baines]], also was a Democrat.

In 2004, he resigned his House seat to take a position as senior policy adviser to U.S. Congressman [[Jeb Bradley]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekly Washington Report: Frank Guinta|url=http://www.newenglandcouncil.com/assets/wr_2010.11.05_washingtonReport.pdf|publisher=New England Council|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref> who preceded Carol Shea-Porter as the U.S. Representative for New Hampshire's First District. Guinta held the post until March, 2005, when he resigned to campaign for mayor of Manchester.<ref name = "votesmartbio"/> Guinta was taking on Mayor Baines, a three-term mayor who had won two-thirds of the vote in the 2003 general election, who was seeking a fourth term.

Guinta worked in the insurance industry before being elected to the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]], where he served from 2000 to 2004; he also served as a Manchester [[alderman]] from 2001 to 2005. He resigned from the State House in 2004 to work as senior policy adviser to Republican Congressman [[Jeb Bradley]].

==Early life, education, and business career==

He graduated from the [[Canterbury School (Connecticut)|Canterbury School]], a Catholic boarding school in [[New Milford, Connecticut]], and [[Assumption College]], a four-year liberal arts college in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]] (where he met his wife, Morgan).

After their marriage, the couple moved to [[Boston]], where Guinta worked for [[Travelers Insurance]] and other entities in the insurance industry. He also began his own insurance consulting firm. He then attended [[Franklin Pierce Law Center]] in [[New Hampshire]], where he earned a Master’s Degree in [[Intellectual Property]].<ref name = "votesmartbio">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=42946 |title=Project VoteSmart candidate biography |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=1970-09-26 |accessdate=2011-03-06}}</ref>

==Early political career==
On November 7, 2000, Guinta was elected to a seat in the [[New Hampshire House of Representatives]], representing [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]]. He was re-elected on November 5, 2002.

In 2001, Guinta ran for the post of [[alderman]] from Manchester's Ward 3. In the non-partisan municipal primary election held on 1 September 2001,<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Results -- City Of Manchester -- Non-Partisan Municipal Primary Election, September 1, 2001|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Portals/2/Departments/city_clerk/elections/Sept.%2018,%202001%20Municipal%20Primary%20Results.pdf|publisher=Manchester, New Hampshire Office of the City Clerk|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref> Guinta and George Skilioganis were the two top vote-getters in Ward 3, with 375 and 279 votes, respectively, securing them a place on the November ballot. On 6 November 2001, Guinta defeated Skilioganis by a vote of 630 to 522 in the general election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Results -- City Of Manchester -- Non-Partisan Municipal General Election, November 6, 2001|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/LinkClick.aspx?fileticket=Ylx9KNhuJ_0%3d&tabid=585|publisher=Manchester, New Hampshire Office of the City Clerk|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref>

Two years later incumbent alderman Guinta and the challenger Glenn R.J. Ouellette, a runner-up in the 2001 primary, faced no opposition in the primary. In the 3 November 2003 general election, Guinta beat Ouellete 452 to 324.<ref>{{cite web|title=Official Results -- City Of Manchester -- Non-Partisan Municipal General Election, November 3, 2003|url=http://www.manchesternh.gov/Portals/2/Departments/city_clerk/elections/Nov%2003%20Official%20Results.pdf|publisher=Manchester, New Hampshire Office of the City Clerk|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref> While serving as alderman, Guinta was one of the few Republicans on the 14-member Board of Alderman. The mayor of Manchester during Guinta's tenure on the board, [[Robert A. Baines]], also was a Democrat.

In 2004, he resigned his House seat to take a position as senior policy adviser to U.S. Congressman [[Jeb Bradley]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Weekly Washington Report: Frank Guinta|url=http://www.newenglandcouncil.com/assets/wr_2010.11.05_washingtonReport.pdf|publisher=New England Council|accessdate=5 August 2013}}</ref> who preceded Carol Shea-Porter as the U.S. Representative for New Hampshire's First District. Guinta held the post until March, 2005, when he resigned to campaign for mayor of Manchester.<ref name = "votesmartbio"/> Guinta was taking on Mayor Baines, a three-term mayor who had won two-thirds of the vote in the 2003 general election, who was seeking a fourth term.

Guinta's Democratic opponent, incumbent [[Carol Shea-Porter]], had represented {{ushr|NH|1}} for two terms.

Guinta says he would vote to repeal the [[Affordable Care Act]], though he supports the provisions of the law that protect people with pre-existing conditions and that allow people to stay on their parents’ health plans until age 26.
