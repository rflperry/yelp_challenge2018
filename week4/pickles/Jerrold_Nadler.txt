==Early life, education and early political career==
Nadler was born in [[Brooklyn]], [[New York City]], [[New York]]. He graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1965<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=n000002 |title=Nadler, Jerrold Lewis |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref> (where his debate team partner was the future philosopher of science [[Alexander Rosenberg]], and his successful campaign for student government president was managed by [[Dick Morris]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuyvesant.ourstrongband.org/PDFs/Letter%20Fall02.pdf |format= [[PDF]] format |title=President's Letter |publisher=The Campaign for Stuyvesant |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

Nadler graduated from [[Columbia University]], where he became of brother of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Alumni|url=http://www.aepi.org/about-aepi/notable-alumni/|publisher=Alpha Epsilon Pi|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> and [[Fordham University School of Law]] in 1978. He worked for [[Eugene McCarthy]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 U.S. presidential campaign]]. Nadler became involved in a controversy with the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 1995, when he wanted the release of data concerning a bank for which the FDIC was then the receiver.

The result of the dispute was a key [[Second Circuit]] precedent on the applicability of the [[Freedom of Information Act]] to circumstances in which a public agency possesses "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential".

==New York Assembly==

===Elections===
Between 1977 to 1983 in the 69th Assembly District. After redistricting, his district was renumbered 67 and he served with that number until 1992.

In 1985, he ran for [[Manhattan Borough President]]. He lost the Democratic primary to [[David Dinkins]] 65%&ndash;35%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=86503].</ref> In the general election, he ran as the [[New York Liberal Party]] nominee and was defeated by Dinkins 77%-12%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=81971].</ref>

In 1989, he ran for [[New York City Comptroller]]. In the Democratic primary, he lost to [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], who won with a plurality of 47% of the vote. Nadler ranked fourth with 4% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=113209].</ref>

===Tenure===
He is credited with authoring legislation dealing with domestic violence and child support enforcement, and was one of the architects of the "Child Support Adjustment Act". Nadler was the only male to be honored as "Assemblymember of the Year" by the National Organization for Women due to his inclusion on the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]s Annual Honor Roll. It was also during his Assembly years that Nadler honed his expertise on issues of urban infrastructure.

===Committee assignments===
Nadler founded and chaired the Assembly Subcommittee on Mass Transit and Rail Freight.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1992, [[Ted Weiss]] was expected to run for re-election in the 8th District, which had been renumbered from the 17th after the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 U.S. Census]]. However, Weiss died a day before the [[primary election]]. Nadler was nominated to replace Weiss. He ran in two elections on Election Day{{spaced ndash}} a special election to serve the rest of Weiss's term, and a regular election for a full two-year term.  He won both handily, and has been re-elected ten times with little serious competition in one of the most Democratic districts in the country.  A [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] has not represented this district or its predecessors in over a century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1061EF7355E0C768EDDA00894DA494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fN%2fNadler%2c%20Jerrold |title=Man in the News; Persistence Pays Off: Jerrold Lewis Nadler |first=Todd S. |last=Purdum |date= September 25, 1992 | work =[[The New York Times]] |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Nadler is a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] and [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Transportation and Infrastructure]] committees. He is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/nadler/biography.shtml |title=Biography |accessdate= November 2, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929000600/http://www.house.gov/nadler/biography.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> Despite earlier efforts to bring impeachment charges against [[George W. Bush]],<ref>Turner, Douglas (February 27, 2006).  "Working Up the Nerve Toward 'Impeachment'".  ''[[The Buffalo News]]''. p. A.6.</ref> and more recent requests from fellow representatives, he did not schedule hearings on [[impeachment]]s for Bush or [[Dick Cheney]], saying in 2007 that doing so would be pointless and would distract from the presidential election.<ref>Bellantoni, Christina (April 6, 2007).  "Liberals Push to Impeach Bush; Key Democrats Balk at Timing".  ''[[The Washington Times]]''. p. A.01. ISSN 9732894.</ref> In a July 15, 2008, ''[[Washington Journal]]'' interview, Nadler reiterated the timing defense <ref>[http://cspanjunkie.org/?p=178].</ref> while stating that Bush had committed impeachable offenses, but that nothing could be done because the system is "overly political". Ten days later, following upon submission of Articles of Impeachment by Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]], the full House Judiciary Committee held hearings covered solely by [[C-SPAN]] <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9F833EE81EC327C0].  (via [[YouTube]]).</ref> regarding the process. A top [[Ronald Reagan]] Justice Department official, [[Bruce Fein]], was among those testifying for impeachment.

Nadler said in a December 2008 interview that he was interested in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat that [[Hillary Clinton]] was planning to resign to become [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] in the [[Obama Administration]]. He cited his opposition to the war in Iraq, the [[PATRIOT Act]], and the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act|Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005]] as among his principal qualifications.<ref>{{Cite episode

Nadler has also vowed to re-introduce the [[Freedom of Choice Act]] during the Obama administration.<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2009/03/catholics_wary_of_possible_bil.html "Catholics wary of possible bill on abortion"].</ref>

Nadler was unhappy with the passage of the surveillance-reform compromise bill, the [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], saying it "abandons the Constitution's protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny".<ref name="Federal Powers">{{cite news|title=House Passes Bill on Federal Wiretapping Powers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/washington/21fisacnd.html?ref=us|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= June 21, 2008}}</ref>

Nadler urged the Attorney General in December 2008 to appoint an independent counsel to investigate [[Dick Cheney]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other top Bush officials for violating the law on torturing prisoners in US custody.<ref name="Torture Laws">{{cite news|title=Rep.

On September 15, 2009, Nadler, along with two other representatives, introduced the [[Respect for Marriage Act]].<ref>Eleveld, Kerry (September 15, 2009). [http://www.advocate.com/Politics/Washington_D_C_/Respect_for_Marriage_Act_Debuts/ "Respect for Marriage Act Debuts"] ''[[The Advocate]]''. Retrieved September 15, 2009.</ref>

Nadler compared Obama's acceptance of Republican demands to extend Bush-era tax cuts at the highest income levels to someone being roughed-up by the mob, asserting that the Republicans would only allow the middle class tax cut if millionaires and billionaires receive a long-term tax cut as well.<ref name="GOP Gangsters">{{cite news|title=Nadler: On Taxes GOP Are a Bunch of Gangsters|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3460_162-7143039.html| publisher = [[CBS News]] |date= December 12, 2010}}</ref>

In January 2011, Nadler called the new GOP majority's plan to read the Constitution on the House floor "ritualistic" and complained that it treated the Constitution like "a sacred text" for "propaganda" purposes.<ref name="Reading between lines">{{cite news|title=Reading between Constitution's lines|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/04/AR2011010405252.html|newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]|date= January 5, 2011}}</ref>

;Income taxes
Nadler has proposed changing the income tax brackets to reflect different regions and their costs of living, which would have lower the tax rate for New Yorkers.<ref name="Fairness is Debated">{{cite news|title=Tax Burdens Tilt Coastal, and System's Fairness Is Debated|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/your-money/taxes/tax-burdens-tilt-coastal-and-systems-fairness-is-debated.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Tax Revolt">{{cite news|title=Liberal Tax Revolt|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703467304575383233009284878.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date= July 23, 2010}}</ref> Nadler has opposed giving tax breaks to high-income earners, saying that the country cannot afford it.<ref name="GOP Gangsters">{{cite news|title=Nadler: On Taxes GOP Are a Bunch of Gangsters|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3460_162-7143039.html| publisher = [[CBS News]]}}</ref>

;Occupy Wall Street
Nadler sent a letter to Attorney General [[Eric H. Holder Jr.]] requesting that Holder investigate whether the police monitoring the [[Occupy protests]] had deprived the protestors' Constitutional rights. It was reported that Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]] of New York City had “ridiculed” Nadler's call for an investigation into police conduct. Bloomberg suggested he would be able to make the streets safer by getting money for homeland security instead.<ref name="OWS Protests">{{cite news|title=Mayor and Congressman Clash on Police at Occupy Wall Street Protests|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/nyregion/bloomberg-and-nadler-clash-on-police-conduct-at-zuccotti-park.html|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

;Voting record
Nadler has a liberal voting record in the House. He gained national prominence during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when he described the process as a "partisan railroad job."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=1998_record&page=H11786&position=all |title=Congressional Record |date= December 18, 1988 |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], Nadler helped to pass bills granting economic aid to the families of those killed and small businesses that were harmed due to the attacks.

Nadler has also promoted legislation to extend [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits to individuals suffering from [[Ground Zero illness]] (physical ailments from the dust from the attacks) or mental health problems as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

This Medicare proposal includes a section that provides for a consortium of organization to study Ground Zero illness.<ref>{{cite web | author = Press release | url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/ny08_nadler/911CompHealthBeneAct090706.html |date= September 7, 2006 |title=Nadler Introduces Major New 9/11 Health Bill: The 9/11 Comprehensive Health Benefits Act |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

He graduated from [[Stuyvesant High School]] in 1965<ref>{{cite web |url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=n000002 |title=Nadler, Jerrold Lewis |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref> (where his debate team partner was the future philosopher of science [[Alexander Rosenberg]], and his successful campaign for student government president was managed by [[Dick Morris]]).<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.stuyvesant.ourstrongband.org/PDFs/Letter%20Fall02.pdf |format= [[PDF]] format |title=President's Letter |publisher=The Campaign for Stuyvesant |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

Nadler graduated from [[Columbia University]], where he became of brother of [[Alpha Epsilon Pi]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Notable Alumni|url=http://www.aepi.org/about-aepi/notable-alumni/|publisher=Alpha Epsilon Pi|accessdate=23 January 2014}}</ref> and [[Fordham University School of Law]] in 1978. He worked for [[Eugene McCarthy]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968 U.S. presidential campaign]]. Nadler became involved in a controversy with the [[Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]] (FDIC) in 1995, when he wanted the release of data concerning a bank for which the FDIC was then the receiver.

The result of the dispute was a key [[Second Circuit]] precedent on the applicability of the [[Freedom of Information Act]] to circumstances in which a public agency possesses "trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person and privileged or confidential".

In 1985, he ran for [[Manhattan Borough President]]. He lost the Democratic primary to [[David Dinkins]] 65%&ndash;35%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=86503].</ref> In the general election, he ran as the [[New York Liberal Party]] nominee and was defeated by Dinkins 77%-12%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=81971].</ref>

In 1989, he ran for [[New York City Comptroller]]. In the Democratic primary, he lost to [[Kings County, New York|Kings County]] [[District Attorney]] [[Elizabeth Holtzman]], who won with a plurality of 47% of the vote. Nadler ranked fourth with 4% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=113209].</ref>

===Tenure===
He is credited with authoring legislation dealing with domestic violence and child support enforcement, and was one of the architects of the "Child Support Adjustment Act". Nadler was the only male to be honored as "Assemblymember of the Year" by the National Organization for Women due to his inclusion on the [[American Civil Liberties Union]]s Annual Honor Roll. It was also during his Assembly years that Nadler honed his expertise on issues of urban infrastructure.

===Committee assignments===

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1992, [[Ted Weiss]] was expected to run for re-election in the 8th District, which had been renumbered from the 17th after the [[United States Census, 1990|1990 U.S. Census]]. However, Weiss died a day before the [[primary election]]. Nadler was nominated to replace Weiss. He ran in two elections on Election Day{{spaced ndash}} a special election to serve the rest of Weiss's term, and a regular election for a full two-year term.  He won both handily, and has been re-elected ten times with little serious competition in one of the most Democratic districts in the country.  A [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] has not represented this district or its predecessors in over a century.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F1061EF7355E0C768EDDA00894DA494D81&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fPeople%2fN%2fNadler%2c%20Jerrold |title=Man in the News; Persistence Pays Off: Jerrold Lewis Nadler |first=Todd S. |last=Purdum |date= September 25, 1992 | work =[[The New York Times]] |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Nadler is a member of the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary]] and [[U.S. House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Transportation and Infrastructure]] committees. He is the Ranking Member of the Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Civil Liberties.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.house.gov/nadler/biography.shtml |title=Biography |accessdate= November 2, 2007 |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20070929000600/http://www.house.gov/nadler/biography.shtml <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = September 29, 2007}}</ref> Despite earlier efforts to bring impeachment charges against [[George W. Bush]],<ref>Turner, Douglas (February 27, 2006).  "Working Up the Nerve Toward 'Impeachment'".  ''[[The Buffalo News]]''. p. A.6.</ref> and more recent requests from fellow representatives, he did not schedule hearings on [[impeachment]]s for Bush or [[Dick Cheney]], saying in 2007 that doing so would be pointless and would distract from the presidential election.<ref>Bellantoni, Christina (April 6, 2007).  "Liberals Push to Impeach Bush; Key Democrats Balk at Timing".  ''[[The Washington Times]]''. p. A.01. ISSN 9732894.</ref> In a July 15, 2008, ''[[Washington Journal]]'' interview, Nadler reiterated the timing defense <ref>[http://cspanjunkie.org/?p=178].</ref> while stating that Bush had committed impeachable offenses, but that nothing could be done because the system is "overly political". Ten days later, following upon submission of Articles of Impeachment by Representative [[Dennis Kucinich]], the full House Judiciary Committee held hearings covered solely by [[C-SPAN]] <ref>[http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=9F833EE81EC327C0].  (via [[YouTube]]).</ref> regarding the process. A top [[Ronald Reagan]] Justice Department official, [[Bruce Fein]], was among those testifying for impeachment.

Nadler said in a December 2008 interview that he was interested in the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] seat that [[Hillary Clinton]] was planning to resign to become [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] in the [[Obama Administration]]. He cited his opposition to the war in Iraq, the [[PATRIOT Act]], and the [[Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act|Bankruptcy Reform Act of 2005]] as among his principal qualifications.<ref>{{Cite episode

Nadler has also vowed to re-introduce the [[Freedom of Choice Act]] during the Obama administration.<ref>[http://www.pennlive.com/midstate/index.ssf/2009/03/catholics_wary_of_possible_bil.html "Catholics wary of possible bill on abortion"].</ref>

Nadler was unhappy with the passage of the surveillance-reform compromise bill, the [[FISA Amendments Act of 2008]], saying it "abandons the Constitution's protections and insulates lawless behavior from legal scrutiny".<ref name="Federal Powers">{{cite news|title=House Passes Bill on Federal Wiretapping Powers|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/21/washington/21fisacnd.html?ref=us|newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |date= June 21, 2008}}</ref>

Nadler urged the Attorney General in December 2008 to appoint an independent counsel to investigate [[Dick Cheney]], [[Donald Rumsfeld]], and other top Bush officials for violating the law on torturing prisoners in US custody.<ref name="Torture Laws">{{cite news|title=Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-NY) Calls for Independent Counsel to Investigate Cheney and Rumsfeld for Violating Torture Laws|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2008/12/23/rep_jerrold_nadler_d_ny_calls|newspaper=Democracy Now!|date= December 23, 2008}}</ref>

On September 15, 2009, Nadler, along with two other representatives, introduced the [[Respect for Marriage Act]].<ref>Eleveld, Kerry (September 15, 2009). [http://www.advocate.com/Politics/Washington_D_C_/Respect_for_Marriage_Act_Debuts/ "Respect for Marriage Act Debuts"] ''[[The Advocate]]''. Retrieved September 15, 2009.</ref>

Nadler compared Obama's acceptance of Republican demands to extend Bush-era tax cuts at the highest income levels to someone being roughed-up by the mob, asserting that the Republicans would only allow the middle class tax cut if millionaires and billionaires receive a long-term tax cut as well.<ref name="GOP Gangsters">{{cite news|title=Nadler: On Taxes GOP Are a Bunch of Gangsters|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3460_162-7143039.html| publisher = [[CBS News]] |date= December 12, 2010}}</ref>

In January 2011, Nadler called the new GOP majority's plan to read the Constitution on the House floor "ritualistic" and complained that it treated the Constitution like "a sacred text" for "propaganda" purposes.<ref name="Reading between lines">{{cite news|title=Reading between Constitution's lines|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2011/01/04/AR2011010405252.html|newspaper= [[The Washington Post]]|date= January 5, 2011}}</ref>

;Income taxes
Nadler has proposed changing the income tax brackets to reflect different regions and their costs of living, which would have lower the tax rate for New Yorkers.<ref name="Fairness is Debated">{{cite news|title=Tax Burdens Tilt Coastal, and System's Fairness Is Debated|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/your-money/taxes/tax-burdens-tilt-coastal-and-systems-fairness-is-debated.html?pagewanted=all|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 11, 2011}}</ref><ref name="Tax Revolt">{{cite news|title=Liberal Tax Revolt|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748703467304575383233009284878.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date= July 23, 2010}}</ref> Nadler has opposed giving tax breaks to high-income earners, saying that the country cannot afford it.<ref name="GOP Gangsters">{{cite news|title=Nadler: On Taxes GOP Are a Bunch of Gangsters|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-3460_162-7143039.html| publisher = [[CBS News]]}}</ref>

;Occupy Wall Street
Nadler sent a letter to Attorney General [[Eric H. Holder Jr.]] requesting that Holder investigate whether the police monitoring the [[Occupy protests]] had deprived the protestors' Constitutional rights. It was reported that Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]] of New York City had “ridiculed” Nadler's call for an investigation into police conduct. Bloomberg suggested he would be able to make the streets safer by getting money for homeland security instead.<ref name="OWS Protests">{{cite news|title=Mayor and Congressman Clash on Police at Occupy Wall Street Protests|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/09/nyregion/bloomberg-and-nadler-clash-on-police-conduct-at-zuccotti-park.html|newspaper= [[The New York Times]]}}</ref>

;Voting record
Nadler has a liberal voting record in the House. He gained national prominence during the impeachment of Bill Clinton, when he described the process as a "partisan railroad job."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=1998_record&page=H11786&position=all |title=Congressional Record |date= December 18, 1988 |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>

After the [[September 11, 2001, attacks]], Nadler helped to pass bills granting economic aid to the families of those killed and small businesses that were harmed due to the attacks.

Nadler has also promoted legislation to extend [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] benefits to individuals suffering from [[Ground Zero illness]] (physical ailments from the dust from the attacks) or mental health problems as a result of the September 11, 2001 attacks.

This Medicare proposal includes a section that provides for a consortium of organization to study Ground Zero illness.<ref>{{cite web | author = Press release | url=http://www.house.gov/list/press/ny08_nadler/911CompHealthBeneAct090706.html |date= September 7, 2006 |title=Nadler Introduces Major New 9/11 Health Bill: The 9/11 Comprehensive Health Benefits Act |accessdate= November 2, 2007}}</ref>
