==Admonishment by House Ethics Committee==

During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to
influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote.
"The subcommittee released a 62-page report... that admonished Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) and House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for possibly breaking House rules by offering support for Smith's son in
exchange for a vote and threatening retaliation if Smith did not vote for the Medicare bill.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63387-2004Sep30.html</ref>

The report... admonished Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) for making comments about Brad Smith during the
Nov 22 roll call that appeared to be "a threat of retaliation" for Nick Smith's vote against the bill.

Representative Miller told the Investigative Subcommittee that the first time she spoke to Representative
Smith about his vote on the Medicare legislation was on the House floor while the vote was open, after
Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she spoke with him during the first hour of the
time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith’s no vote on the board and
she ‘‘didn’t like the way that he voted.’’ Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she
approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: ‘‘Is this how you’re going to vote; or, This
is how you’re going to vote? And he said, Obviously.’’

Representative Miller recalled that she responded by saying words to the effect of: ‘‘Well, I hope your son
doesn’t come to Congress, or I’m not going to support your son, or something to that effect.’’ Representative
Smith then ‘‘rose up out of his seat and said, You get out of here.’’ That was the end of the interaction
between the two Members. Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She
told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote
on the Medicare legislation.

Representative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller ‘‘came up and said something like, I haven’t been involved in this campaign before, but if you don’t change your vote, I’ll get involved, and I’ll make sure Brad isn’t elected.’’<ref>http://ethics.house.gov/committee-report/investigation-certain-allegations-related-voting-medicare-prescription-drug</ref>

On August 31, 2011, Miller complained about the publication by [[WikiLeaks]] (a non-profit document archive organisation) of classified documents purloined from the [[U. S. Government]], “The latest release of stolen American secrets by the organization WikiLeaks once again proves that they are a terrorist operation that puts the lives of Americans and our allies at risk. Particularly contemptible and criminal is the release of the identities of sources of information to our nation from those working against despotic regimes or terrorist organizations. WikiLeaks can no longer say that they are anything more than an organization that aids and abets enemies of freedom. It is long past time for the Obama Administration to take decisive action to shut this criminal operation down and to bring those who steal and release America’s secrets and put our allies at risk to justice.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boogai.net/repwatch/wikileaks-is-a-terrorist-operation/|title=WikiLeaks is a Terrorist Operation |publisher= |date=August 31, 2011|accessdate=2012-05-09|first= |last= |others=Carmen Reynolds, editor in chief |series=RepWatch}} {{Verify credibility|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Miller, along with [[Loretta Sanchez|Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez]], introduced {{USBill|113|H.R.|3141}}, the [[Biometric Exit Improvement Act of 2013]].

She said that "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater."<ref name="insurJournMI"/>

==Political campaigns==

===1994===
Miller was elected [[Michigan Secretary of State]], unseating 6-term incumbent [[Richard H. Austin]]. She was the first Republican to serve as Secretary of State in Michigan in 40 years since [[Owen Cleary]] left office in 1955.

===1998===
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Perry Spencer by 1 million votes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/98gen/03000000.html |accessdate=May 9, 2012

===2002===
After the [[2000 United States Census]], the [[Michigan Legislature]] reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[David Bonior]]. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb]]. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the [[governor of Michigan]] rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a "[[Hubert Humphrey]] Democrat", and Miller called herself a "[[George W. Bush]] Republican." She outraised Marlinga, and secured the [[Teamsters Union]] (but not [[AFL-CIO]]) endorsement.<ref name=Barone_2010>{{cite book

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]], Miller endorsed Former [[New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, "When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation."

Miller spoke on behalf of Senator [[John McCain]] and was a vocal supporter of Governor [[Sarah Palin]]. She was a member of Gov. Palin's "truth squad" leading up to the 2008 presidential election.

==Admonishment by House Ethics Committee==

During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to
influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote.
"The subcommittee released a 62-page report... that admonished Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) and House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for possibly breaking House rules by offering support for Smith's son in
exchange for a vote and threatening retaliation if Smith did not vote for the Medicare bill.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63387-2004Sep30.html</ref>

The report... admonished Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) for making comments about Brad Smith during the
Nov 22 roll call that appeared to be "a threat of retaliation" for Nick Smith's vote against the bill.

Representative Miller told the Investigative Subcommittee that the first time she spoke to Representative
Smith about his vote on the Medicare legislation was on the House floor while the vote was open, after
Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she spoke with him during the first hour of the
time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith’s no vote on the board and
she ‘‘didn’t like the way that he voted.’’ Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she
approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: ‘‘Is this how you’re going to vote; or, This
is how you’re going to vote? And he said, Obviously.’’

Representative Miller recalled that she responded by saying words to the effect of: ‘‘Well, I hope your son
doesn’t come to Congress, or I’m not going to support your son, or something to that effect.’’ Representative
Smith then ‘‘rose up out of his seat and said, You get out of here.’’ That was the end of the interaction
between the two Members. Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She
told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote
on the Medicare legislation.

Representative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller ‘‘came up and said something like, I haven’t been involved in this campaign before, but if you don’t change your vote, I’ll get involved, and I’ll make sure Brad isn’t elected.’’<ref>http://ethics.house.gov/committee-report/investigation-certain-allegations-related-voting-medicare-prescription-drug</ref>

On August 31, 2011, Miller complained about the publication by [[WikiLeaks]] (a non-profit document archive organisation) of classified documents purloined from the [[U. S. Government]], “The latest release of stolen American secrets by the organization WikiLeaks once again proves that they are a terrorist operation that puts the lives of Americans and our allies at risk. Particularly contemptible and criminal is the release of the identities of sources of information to our nation from those working against despotic regimes or terrorist organizations. WikiLeaks can no longer say that they are anything more than an organization that aids and abets enemies of freedom. It is long past time for the Obama Administration to take decisive action to shut this criminal operation down and to bring those who steal and release America’s secrets and put our allies at risk to justice.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boogai.net/repwatch/wikileaks-is-a-terrorist-operation/|title=WikiLeaks is a Terrorist Operation |publisher= |date=August 31, 2011|accessdate=2012-05-09|first= |last= |others=Carmen Reynolds, editor in chief |series=RepWatch}} {{Verify credibility|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Miller, along with [[Loretta Sanchez|Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez]], introduced {{USBill|113|H.R.|3141}}, the [[Biometric Exit Improvement Act of 2013]].

Miller opposed the bill and argued that the state of Michigan should opt-out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should.<ref name=insurJournMI>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Stephanie K.|title=U.S. Congresswoman: Flood Insurance Bill Bad for Michigan|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2014/03/05/322269.htm|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=Insurance Journal|date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater."<ref name="insurJournMI"/>

==Political campaigns==

===1994===
Miller was elected [[Michigan Secretary of State]], unseating 6-term incumbent [[Richard H. Austin]]. She was the first Republican to serve as Secretary of State in Michigan in 40 years since [[Owen Cleary]] left office in 1955.

===1998===
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Perry Spencer by 1 million votes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/98gen/03000000.html |accessdate=May 9, 2012

===2002===
After the [[2000 United States Census]], the [[Michigan Legislature]] reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[David Bonior]]. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb]]. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the [[governor of Michigan]] rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a "[[Hubert Humphrey]] Democrat", and Miller called herself a "[[George W. Bush]] Republican." She outraised Marlinga, and secured the [[Teamsters Union]] (but not [[AFL-CIO]]) endorsement.<ref name=Barone_2010>{{cite book

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]], Miller endorsed Former [[New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, "When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation."

Miller spoke on behalf of Senator [[John McCain]] and was a vocal supporter of Governor [[Sarah Palin]]. She was a member of Gov. Palin's "truth squad" leading up to the 2008 presidential election.

==Admonishment by House Ethics Committee==

During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to
influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote.
"The subcommittee released a 62-page report... that admonished Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) and House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for possibly breaking House rules by offering support for Smith's son in
exchange for a vote and threatening retaliation if Smith did not vote for the Medicare bill.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63387-2004Sep30.html</ref>

The report... admonished Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) for making comments about Brad Smith during the
Nov 22 roll call that appeared to be "a threat of retaliation" for Nick Smith's vote against the bill.

Representative Miller told the Investigative Subcommittee that the first time she spoke to Representative
Smith about his vote on the Medicare legislation was on the House floor while the vote was open, after
Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she spoke with him during the first hour of the
time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith’s no vote on the board and
she ‘‘didn’t like the way that he voted.’’ Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she
approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: ‘‘Is this how you’re going to vote; or, This
is how you’re going to vote? And he said, Obviously.’’

Representative Miller recalled that she responded by saying words to the effect of: ‘‘Well, I hope your son
doesn’t come to Congress, or I’m not going to support your son, or something to that effect.’’ Representative
Smith then ‘‘rose up out of his seat and said, You get out of here.’’ That was the end of the interaction
between the two Members. Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She
told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote
on the Medicare legislation.

Representative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller ‘‘came up and said something like, I haven’t been involved in this campaign before, but if you don’t change your vote, I’ll get involved, and I’ll make sure Brad isn’t elected.’’<ref>http://ethics.house.gov/committee-report/investigation-certain-allegations-related-voting-medicare-prescription-drug</ref>

On August 31, 2011, Miller complained about the publication by [[WikiLeaks]] (a non-profit document archive organisation) of classified documents purloined from the [[U. S. Government]], “The latest release of stolen American secrets by the organization WikiLeaks once again proves that they are a terrorist operation that puts the lives of Americans and our allies at risk. Particularly contemptible and criminal is the release of the identities of sources of information to our nation from those working against despotic regimes or terrorist organizations. WikiLeaks can no longer say that they are anything more than an organization that aids and abets enemies of freedom. It is long past time for the Obama Administration to take decisive action to shut this criminal operation down and to bring those who steal and release America’s secrets and put our allies at risk to justice.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boogai.net/repwatch/wikileaks-is-a-terrorist-operation/|title=WikiLeaks is a Terrorist Operation |publisher= |date=August 31, 2011|accessdate=2012-05-09|first= |last= |others=Carmen Reynolds, editor in chief |series=RepWatch}} {{Verify credibility|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Miller opposed the bill and argued that the state of Michigan should opt-out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should.<ref name=insurJournMI>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Stephanie K.|title=U.S. Congresswoman: Flood Insurance Bill Bad for Michigan|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2014/03/05/322269.htm|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=Insurance Journal|date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater."<ref name="insurJournMI"/>

==Political campaigns==

===1994===
Miller was elected [[Michigan Secretary of State]], unseating 6-term incumbent [[Richard H. Austin]]. She was the first Republican to serve as Secretary of State in Michigan in 40 years since [[Owen Cleary]] left office in 1955.

===1998===
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Perry Spencer by 1 million votes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/98gen/03000000.html |accessdate=May 9, 2012

===2002===
After the [[2000 United States Census]], the [[Michigan Legislature]] reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[David Bonior]]. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb]]. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the [[governor of Michigan]] rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a "[[Hubert Humphrey]] Democrat", and Miller called herself a "[[George W. Bush]] Republican." She outraised Marlinga, and secured the [[Teamsters Union]] (but not [[AFL-CIO]]) endorsement.<ref name=Barone_2010>{{cite book

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]], Miller endorsed Former [[New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, "When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation."

Miller spoke on behalf of Senator [[John McCain]] and was a vocal supporter of Governor [[Sarah Palin]]. She was a member of Gov. Palin's "truth squad" leading up to the 2008 presidential election.

==Admonishment by House Ethics Committee==

During the 108th Congress, Miller was admonished by the House Ethics Committee for improperly attempting to
influence the vote of fellow Michigan Congressman Nick Smith on a Medicare vote.
"The subcommittee released a 62-page report... that admonished Rep. Candice Miller (R-Mich.) and House
Majority Leader Tom DeLay (R-Texas) for possibly breaking House rules by offering support for Smith's son in
exchange for a vote and threatening retaliation if Smith did not vote for the Medicare bill.<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A63387-2004Sep30.html</ref>

The report... admonished Rep. Candice S. Miller (R-Mich.) for making comments about Brad Smith during the
Nov 22 roll call that appeared to be "a threat of retaliation" for Nick Smith's vote against the bill.

Representative Miller told the Investigative Subcommittee that the first time she spoke to Representative
Smith about his vote on the Medicare legislation was on the House floor while the vote was open, after
Representative Smith had cast his vote. She estimated that she spoke with him during the first hour of the
time that the vote was held open. Representative Miller saw Representative Smith’s no vote on the board and
she ‘‘didn’t like the way that he voted.’’ Representative Miller testified that, on her own initiative, she
approached Representative Smith and said words to the effect of: ‘‘Is this how you’re going to vote; or, This
is how you’re going to vote? And he said, Obviously.’’

Representative Miller recalled that she responded by saying words to the effect of: ‘‘Well, I hope your son
doesn’t come to Congress, or I’m not going to support your son, or something to that effect.’’ Representative
Smith then ‘‘rose up out of his seat and said, You get out of here.’’ That was the end of the interaction
between the two Members. Representative Miller estimated that the exchange lasted for about ten seconds. She
told the Investigative Subcommittee that she did not at any point ask Representative Smith to change his vote
on the Medicare legislation.

Representative Smith told the Investigative Subcommittee that Representative Miller specifically threatened to work against his son if he did not change his vote. Representative Smith’s recollection was that Representative Miller ‘‘came up and said something like, I haven’t been involved in this campaign before, but if you don’t change your vote, I’ll get involved, and I’ll make sure Brad isn’t elected.’’<ref>http://ethics.house.gov/committee-report/investigation-certain-allegations-related-voting-medicare-prescription-drug</ref>

On August 31, 2011, Miller complained about the publication by [[WikiLeaks]] (a non-profit document archive organisation) of classified documents purloined from the [[U. S. Government]], “The latest release of stolen American secrets by the organization WikiLeaks once again proves that they are a terrorist operation that puts the lives of Americans and our allies at risk. Particularly contemptible and criminal is the release of the identities of sources of information to our nation from those working against despotic regimes or terrorist organizations. WikiLeaks can no longer say that they are anything more than an organization that aids and abets enemies of freedom. It is long past time for the Obama Administration to take decisive action to shut this criminal operation down and to bring those who steal and release America’s secrets and put our allies at risk to justice.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.boogai.net/repwatch/wikileaks-is-a-terrorist-operation/|title=WikiLeaks is a Terrorist Operation |publisher= |date=August 31, 2011|accessdate=2012-05-09|first= |last= |others=Carmen Reynolds, editor in chief |series=RepWatch}} {{Verify credibility|date=May 2012}}</ref>

Miller opposed the bill and argued that the state of Michigan should opt-out of the National Flood Insurance Program entirely and urged the governor to do so. According to Miller, Michigan residents subsidize other, more flood prone parts of the country, by paying higher premiums than they should.<ref name=insurJournMI>{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Stephanie K.|title=U.S. Congresswoman: Flood Insurance Bill Bad for Michigan|url=http://www.insurancejournal.com/news/midwest/2014/03/05/322269.htm|accessdate=6 March 2014|newspaper=Insurance Journal|date=5 March 2014}}</ref> Miller accused insurance premiums of being decides by politics rather than actuarial costs. She said that "too many Americans across this nation are paying rates far below what actual risk would dictate in the marketplace while others, including many who I represent, are being forced to pay into a program that they do not need or want to help subsidize lower rates for other favored groups whose risk is far greater."<ref name="insurJournMI"/>

==Political campaigns==

===1994===
Miller was elected [[Michigan Secretary of State]], unseating 6-term incumbent [[Richard H. Austin]]. She was the first Republican to serve as Secretary of State in Michigan in 40 years since [[Owen Cleary]] left office in 1955.

===1998===
Miller carried every county in Michigan (including [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]], home to Detroit) and beat both Democrat Mary Parks and [[Reform Party of the United States of America|Reform Party's]] Perry Spencer by 1 million votes,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://miboecfr.nicusa.com/election/results/98gen/03000000.html |accessdate=May 9, 2012

===2002===
After the [[2000 United States Census]], the [[Michigan Legislature]] reconfigured the state's congressional map. In the process, they redrew the 10th District, represented by 13-term [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] [[David Bonior]]. The old 10th had been a fairly compact district taking in most of Macomb and St. Clair counties. However, the reconfigured 10th was pushed all the way to the [[Michigan Thumb|Thumb]]. In the process, the legislature moved Miller's home in Harrison Township into the district, while shifting Bonior's home in [[Mount Clemens]] to the neighboring 12th District. Bonior opted to run for the [[governor of Michigan]] rather than run for re-election to the House of Representatives. Miller won the Republican primary, and in the general election in November she handily beat Carl Marlinga, the Macomb County Prosecutor since 1982. Marlinga called himself a "[[Hubert Humphrey]] Democrat", and Miller called herself a "[[George W. Bush]] Republican." She outraised Marlinga, and secured the [[Teamsters Union]] (but not [[AFL-CIO]]) endorsement.<ref name=Barone_2010>{{cite book

During the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 Presidential election]], Miller endorsed Former [[New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]] for president. At the Michigan Republican convention, she explained, "When deciding what candidate I wanted to be our next President of the United States I knew we needed someone who would continue the fight against terrorism, who has proven leadership and who has the record and experience of managing government and improving the economy. Again and again on the most important issues facing America I came to the same conclusion, that former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani is the man we need to lead our nation."
