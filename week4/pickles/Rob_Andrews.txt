===Tenure===
Andrews is generally considered a moderate by Democratic standards, though he votes with his party most of the time. ''[[The New York Times]]'' has characterized Congressman Andrews as "fiscally conservative&nbsp;... and socially moderate."<ref>[http://www.house.gov/andrews/about_biography.shtml Robert E. Andrews - First District of New Jersey]</ref> He has a lifetime rating of 17.24 (and a 2007 rating of 0) from the [[American Conservative Union]] and a 2007 rating of 100 from [[Americans for Democratic Action]].<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080510125244/http://www.acuratings.org/2007all.htm#NJ ACU Ratings]</ref><ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=26949&type=category&category=45&go.x=10&go.y=10 Ratings on liberal issues collated by Project Vote Smart]</ref>  He has a liberal rating of 76.2 and a conservative rating of 23.8 from the ''[[National Journal]]''.<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/voteratings/states/index.htm?state=nj#vr National Journal's 2007 Vote Ratings for New Jersey]</ref> In recent years, his voting record has trended progressively more liberal.

Andrews served for his entire Congressional career on the [[United States House Committee on Education and Labor|House Committee on Education and Labor]]. He was the Democratic leader and ranking member on the [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations|Education Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations]], and was the chairman of the [[United States House Education Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions|Education Subcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions]] which has responsibility for the health insurance, pension and labor laws of the nation. He also served on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]], which maintains jurisdiction over funding for the military forces.

Using [[Amtrak]] to commute from his Haddon Heights home while Congress is in session so that he can be closer to his family and constituents, Andrews does not maintain a residence in [[Washington, D.C.]]. Andrews is an ardent supporter of Amtrak [[subsidy|subsidies]].

Andrews voted for the [[Secure Fence Act of 2006]], authorizing the erection of a 700-mile fence across the U.S.-[[Mexico]] border.

On October 10, 2002, Rob Andrews was among the 81 House Democrats who voted in favor of authorizing the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]] (126 Democrats in the House were opposed) and was the only Democratic member of the New Jersey Congressional delegation to co-sponsor the [[Iraq Resolution]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll455.xml House Roll Call 455] [[Clerk of the United States House of Representatives|Office of the Clerk]]</ref><ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d107:HJ00114:@@@P H.J.RES.114 Co-sponsors] [[Library of Congress|The Library of Congress]]</ref> In 2005, he voted in favor of [[Flag Desecration Amendment|amending the U.S. Constitution to prohibit desecration of the American flag]].

He was also involved in proposing a bill for sanctioning Iran in 2007.

In 2013, Andrews proposed an amendment to the 2014 defense bill that would have added atheists, humanists, and "ethical culturalists" to the corps of chaplains.

==Other political activities==

===1997 gubernatorial election===
{{Main|New Jersey gubernatorial election, 1997}}
In 1997, Andrews ran for [[Governor of New Jersey]]. In the Democratic primary, he was defeated 40%-37%, a margin of just 9,993 votes, by State Senator [[Jim McGreevey]].<ref>Pulley, Brett. [http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9B03E1DD103DF937A35755C0A961958260 "McGreevey Wins Democratic Nod for Governor"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 4, 1997. Retrieved November 28, 2007.</ref>

===Speculation between 1998 and 2007===
Andrews was reportedly considering a [[primary election|primary]] challenge in 2005, before McGreevey's resignation. While Andrews had been frequently mentioned as a possible replacement for [[Jon Corzine]]'s [[United States Senate]] seat after Corzine's November 2005 gubernatorial victory, [[Bob Menendez]] was eventually chosen by Corzine to fill the vacancy. Andrews had informally announced his plan to run in the 2006 Democratic primary against Menendez, but in January 2006 announced that he would run for a ninth full term in the House and seek the Senate seat in 2008 if U.S. Senator [[Frank Lautenberg]] retired.

===2008 Senate election===
{{see also|United States Senate election in New Jersey, 2008}}
Lautenberg ran for re-election to his Senate seat in 2008 but Andrews filed to become a candidate in the Democratic primary shortly before the deadline for doing so.<ref name=AndrewsSenateAnnouncement>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/nyregion/03senate.html |title=Congressman to Challenge Lautenberg in Democratic Senate Primary |first=David W. |last=Chen |newspaper=The New York Times |date=April 3, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref> Andrews accused the 84-year-old Lautenberg of being too old to be effective in the Senate.<ref name=PoliticoSenate>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/thecrypt/0608/Lautenberg_defeats_Andrews_in_NJ_Senate_primary.html |title=Lautenberg defeats Andrews in N.J. Senate primary |publisher=[[Politico]] |date=June 3, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref> While running for the Senate, his wife [[Camille Andrews]] was placed on the Democratic primary ballot to run for Andrews' House seat.<ref name=CamilleBallot>{{cite news |url=http://www.politickernj.com/editor/18171/camille-andrews-will-file-congress |title=Camille Andrews will file for Congress |author=Staff |publisher=Politicker NJ |date=April 7, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref>

Andrews was beaten by Lautenberg in the Senate primary held on June 5, 2008.<ref name=PoliticoSenate/> In September, Andrews replaced his wife (who won the primary election) on the general election ballot for the House seat he still held.<ref name=NYTSeptemberBallot>{{cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/09/05/nyregion/05andrews.html |title=Congressman Seeks to Replace Wife on Ballot |first=Nicholas |last=Confessore |newspaper=The New York Times |date=September 4, 2008 |accessdate=December 22, 2013}}</ref> He subsequently won re-election to his house seat that year.

===2008 presidential election===
Andrews is a [[superdelegate]] within the Democratic Party and prior to the [[Super Tuesday, 2008|New Jersey primary]] he endorsed [[Hillary Clinton]] for the Democratic nomination.<ref>[http://web.archive.org/web/20080731005937/http://www.hillaryclinton.com/news/release/view/?id=1428 Press Release: Gov. Corzine, NJ Officials Endorse Clinton] HillaryClinton.com</ref> Following the results from the Indiana and North Carolina primaries Andrews stated that he believed Senator [[Barack Obama]] would win the nomination and that the party should unite behind him. However he did not switch his vote as a superdelegate from Clinton to Obama stating that "such a move might retard the process of unifying the party".<ref>[http://www.nj.com/news/ledger/index.ssf?/base/news-13/1210687509315090.xml&coll=1 "Andrews: Time for Democrats to unite"] May 13, 2008 [[The Star-Ledger]]</ref>

==Personal life==
Andrews is married to [[Camille Andrews|Camille Spinello Andrews]], an associate dean of enrollment and projects at [[Rutgers School of Law - Camden]]. They have two daughters, Jackie and Josie.<ref>[http://camlaw.rutgers.edu/bio/912/ Profile of Camille Spinello Andrews] from [[Rutgers School of Law - Camden]]. Retrieved December 23, 2006.</ref>
