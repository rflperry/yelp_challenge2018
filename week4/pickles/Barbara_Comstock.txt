== Candidacy for U.S. Congress ==

On January 7, 2014 she announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 10th District, following the announcement that Rep. Frank Wolf will retire at the end of the 113th Congress rather than run for reelection.

[[The Daily Caller]] reported that an [[opposition research]] packet on Comstock suggests she "will likely come under fire in Virginia’s 10th congressional district race over the question of whether she is conservative enough."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pappas|first=Alex|title=Here’s the opposition research packet on Barbara Comstock|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/04/heres-the-opposition-research-packet-on-barbara-comstock/#ixzz2sT2oW3UP|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Daily Caller|date=5 February 2014}}</ref>

On April 26, 2014, Barbara Comstock won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 10th District firehouse primary, defeating five other candidates and winning approximately 54% of the total vote.

While debating [[John Foust]] at Virginia's 10th Congressional District Debate, Comstock answered a question about how congress should handle comprehensive immigration reform. She said, “Fed-Ex can track packages coming in here all of the time, we can track people who are coming into the country and we can do that right.” She then went on to oppose passing comprehensive immigration reform preferring a piecemeal approach instead.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia 10th Congressional District Debate: Clip|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4509580/fedex-can-track-packages-coming-time-can-track-people-coming-country|website=CSPAN|publisher=National Cable Satellite|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sakuma|first1=Amanda|title=GOP candidate: US should track immigrants like Fed-Ex packages|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/barbara-comstock-us-should-track-immigrants-fed-ex-packages|accessdate=19 October 2014|agency=MSNBC|publisher=NBC Universal|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

Comstock in tandem with Republican Senate candidate [[Ed Gillespie]] planned on attending a public meeting Northern Shenandoah Valley Tea Party in early August. After rumors arose that questions would be taken from the crowd at this public event, both candidates moved the meeting to a private location. After criticism from Democratic candidates about why they needed to hide behind closed doors to meet with their base of voters, Comstock and Gillespie opted to chat with the group by phone instead. This decision prompted a statement from David Sparkman, chairman of the Tea Party group, to say, "I'm disappointed, I wanted to look these politicians in the eye and take their measure."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Portnoy|first1=Jenna|title=Gillespie, Comstock choose call after event venue is changed to evade ‘unfriendlies’|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gillespie-comstock-choose-tele-talk-over-tea-party-event-to-evade-unfriendlies/2014/08/07/c387f272-1e5f-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html|website=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>

== Candidacy for U.S. Congress ==

On January 7, 2014 she announced her candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives from Virginia's 10th District, following the announcement that Rep. Frank Wolf will retire at the end of the 113th Congress rather than run for reelection.

[[The Daily Caller]] reported that an [[opposition research]] packet on Comstock suggests she "will likely come under fire in Virginia’s 10th congressional district race over the question of whether she is conservative enough."<ref>{{cite news|last=Pappas|first=Alex|title=Here’s the opposition research packet on Barbara Comstock|url=http://dailycaller.com/2014/02/04/heres-the-opposition-research-packet-on-barbara-comstock/#ixzz2sT2oW3UP|accessdate=5 February 2014|newspaper=The Daily Caller|date=5 February 2014}}</ref>

On April 26, 2014, Barbara Comstock won the Republican nomination for the U.S. House of Representatives in the 10th District firehouse primary, defeating five other candidates and winning approximately 54% of the total vote.

While debating [[John Foust]] at Virginia's 10th Congressional District Debate, Comstock answered a question about how congress should handle comprehensive immigration reform. She said, “Fed-Ex can track packages coming in here all of the time, we can track people who are coming into the country and we can do that right.” She then went on to oppose passing comprehensive immigration reform preferring a piecemeal approach instead.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia 10th Congressional District Debate: Clip|url=http://www.c-span.org/video/?c4509580/fedex-can-track-packages-coming-time-can-track-people-coming-country|website=CSPAN|publisher=National Cable Satellite|accessdate=19 October 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Sakuma|first1=Amanda|title=GOP candidate: US should track immigrants like Fed-Ex packages|url=http://www.msnbc.com/msnbc/barbara-comstock-us-should-track-immigrants-fed-ex-packages|accessdate=19 October 2014|agency=MSNBC|publisher=NBC Universal|date=25 September 2014}}</ref>

Comstock in tandem with Republican Senate candidate [[Ed Gillespie]] planned on attending a public meeting Northern Shenandoah Valley Tea Party in early August. After rumors arose that questions would be taken from the crowd at this public event, both candidates moved the meeting to a private location. After criticism from Democratic candidates about why they needed to hide behind closed doors to meet with their base of voters, Comstock and Gillespie opted to chat with the group by phone instead. This decision prompted a statement from David Sparkman, chairman of the Tea Party group, to say, "I'm disappointed, I wanted to look these politicians in the eye and take their measure."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Portnoy|first1=Jenna|title=Gillespie, Comstock choose call after event venue is changed to evade ‘unfriendlies’|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/local/virginia-politics/gillespie-comstock-choose-tele-talk-over-tea-party-event-to-evade-unfriendlies/2014/08/07/c387f272-1e5f-11e4-82f9-2cd6fa8da5c4_story.html|website=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref>
