;High-speed rail
Costa has been an advocate of creating a high-speed rail system that would go up and down California as well as across the nation at speeds of 225 miles-per-hour. He has introduced many bills supporting these rails; so far, none have passed. Miller has compared rail projects to Eisenhower's highway expansion and pleaded to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and President Obama for help in with this project.<ref name="Costa Profile">{{cite news|title=Jim Costa|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jim-costa-d-calif/gIQAwvJSAP_topic.html|work=Political Profile|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 21, 2012}}</ref>

In April 2008, Costa wrote a piece in ''Capitol Weekly'' calling for high-speed rail in California.<ref name="Transportation system">{{cite web|title=High speed rail: a viable transportation system for California|url=http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_adctlid=v%7Cjq2q43wvsl855o%7Cx1wzkesety80ym&issueId=x1uh8zbb6q8afq&xid=x1uzxza4c74tim|publisher=Capitol Weekly|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> 

;Lao- and Hmong-Americans, Laos Memorial & Veterans Burial Honors Bill
Tens of thousands of minority Laotian- and Hmong-American veterans and their refugee families reside in Congressman Costa's district, having been resettled as political refugees in California-- when they fled persecution from the [[Marxist]] regime in [[communist]] [[Laos]] following the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975 and the military takeover of the Kingdom of Laos by the [[Pathet Lao]] and communist forces from [[Vietnam]]. Costa garnered support from this significant Lao- and Hmong-American community in California, in large part, because of his leadership and support for S. 200, "The Lao Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill," co-introduced by Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska, which would grant burial honors to Lao and Hmong Veterans of the U.S. Secret War in Laos.<ref> Doyle, Michael, McClatchy News (October 28, 2009) "Hmong, Lao veterans seek burials in national cemeteries", http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/10/28/77920/hmong-lao-veterans-seek-burials.html#.Ue86Em3c2E4#storylink=cpy </ref><ref>China Weekly News (August 10, 2010) "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored by Congress with National Burial Bill." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-234438009.html </ref> <ref>States News Service (October 14, 2011) [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-269702570.html "COSTA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HONOR HMONG VETERANS"], highbeam.com; accessed November 15, 2014.</ref><ref> [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-320483452.html "Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill Introduced in U.S. Senate"], ''China Weekly News'', February 19, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/nation/la-na-nn-hmong-soldier-cemeteries-20130206 "Hmong soldiers who aided U.S. seek burial in national cemeteries"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 6, 2013.</ref> 

Each year, the Fresno-based [[Lao Veterans of America]] and [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]] organize delegations from the Central Valley, and Rep. Costa's district, that travel to Washington, D.C., and [[Arlington National Cemetery]] to play homage at the [[Laos Memorial]] and honor the Lao- and Hmong-American veterans, and their American advisers, who served and died with U.S. CIA [[Central Intelligence Agency]] clandestine and military forces during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Doyle, Michael,[http://www.modbee.com/2013/05/12/2712540/hmong-honor-dead-from-war.html#storylink=cpy "Central Valley Hmong among those honoring dead from war"], ''Modesto Bee'', May 12, 2013.</ref><ref> [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1205/S00337/laos-hmong-veterans-honored-at-national-ceremonies.htm "Laos, Hmong Veterans Honored At National Ceremonies"], Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, May 15, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130512005048/en/Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Vietnam-War-Honored-National "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored At National Ceremonies"], businesswire.com, May 12, 2013.</ref>

===Political campaigns===
;2004
In 2004, Costa entered the Democratic primary for the 20th District, which was opened up by the retirement of its seven-term incumbent, [[Cal Dooley]]. Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]], endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] state senator [[Roy Ashburn]] in November.

The 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave [[Al Gore]] his highest vote total outside the state's two large [[conurbation]]s ([[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the north and [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] to the south).  Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, "Costa's going to cost ya," and linked him to former Governor [[Gray Davis]], calling them "two taxing twins". Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican [[Kings County, California|Kings County]].

;2006
Costa ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources|Natural Resources Committee]]'s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]].

;2008
Costa was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2010#District 20}}
Costa was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee [[Andy Vidak]]. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after Election Day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-200878-1.html|title=Costa Holds Seat, Keeps GOP Pickups at 63: Roll Call Politics|publisher=Rollcall.com|date=2010-11-23|accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 votes (48.2%) for Vidak.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 16}}
For his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and [[Bakersfield]]. However, redistricting following the 2010 Census renumbered his district as the 21st district and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa officially announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th District, a much more compact district including most of Fresno, as well as most of [[Merced, California|Merced]].<ref name="Announces 2012">{{cite news|title=Rep.

He ultimately voted in favor of the legislation.<ref name="Costa yes">{{cite news|title=Costa a yes|url=http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0310/Costa_a_yes.html|newspaper=Politico|date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> To gain Costa's vote, the House leadership reportedly promised Costa and [[Dennis Cardoza]] funding for a medical school for California's Central Valley.<ref name="Bills move along">{{cite news|title=Side deals stack up as health bills move along|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/69239-side-deals-stack-up-in-health-bills|newspaper=The Hill|date=November 23, 2009}}</ref> 

;High-speed rail
Costa has been an advocate of creating a high-speed rail system that would go up and down California as well as across the nation at speeds of 225 miles-per-hour. He has introduced many bills supporting these rails; so far, none have passed. Miller has compared rail projects to Eisenhower's highway expansion and pleaded to Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood and President Obama for help in with this project.<ref name="Costa Profile">{{cite news|title=Jim Costa|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/jim-costa-d-calif/gIQAwvJSAP_topic.html|work=Political Profile|publisher=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 21, 2012}}</ref>

In April 2008, Costa wrote a piece in ''Capitol Weekly'' calling for high-speed rail in California.<ref name="Transportation system">{{cite web|title=High speed rail: a viable transportation system for California|url=http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_adctlid=v%7Cjq2q43wvsl855o%7Cx1wzkesety80ym&issueId=x1uh8zbb6q8afq&xid=x1uzxza4c74tim|publisher=Capitol Weekly|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref> 

;Lao- and Hmong-Americans, Laos Memorial & Veterans Burial Honors Bill
Tens of thousands of minority Laotian- and Hmong-American veterans and their refugee families reside in Congressman Costa's district, having been resettled as political refugees in California-- when they fled persecution from the [[Marxist]] regime in [[communist]] [[Laos]] following the end of the [[Vietnam War]] in 1975 and the military takeover of the Kingdom of Laos by the [[Pathet Lao]] and communist forces from [[Vietnam]]. Costa garnered support from this significant Lao- and Hmong-American community in California, in large part, because of his leadership and support for S. 200, "The Lao Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill," co-introduced by Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] of Alaska, which would grant burial honors to Lao and Hmong Veterans of the U.S. Secret War in Laos.<ref> Doyle, Michael, McClatchy News (October 28, 2009) "Hmong, Lao veterans seek burials in national cemeteries", http://www.mcclatchydc.com/2009/10/28/77920/hmong-lao-veterans-seek-burials.html#.Ue86Em3c2E4#storylink=cpy </ref><ref>China Weekly News (August 10, 2010) "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored by Congress with National Burial Bill." http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-234438009.html </ref> <ref>States News Service (October 14, 2011) [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-269702570.html "COSTA INTRODUCES LEGISLATION TO HONOR HMONG VETERANS"], highbeam.com; accessed November 15, 2014.</ref><ref> [http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-320483452.html "Laos, Hmong Veterans Burial Honors Bill Introduced in U.S. Senate"], ''China Weekly News'', February 19, 2013.</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2013/feb/06/nation/la-na-nn-hmong-soldier-cemeteries-20130206 "Hmong soldiers who aided U.S. seek burial in national cemeteries"], ''Los Angeles Times'', February 6, 2013.</ref> 

Each year, the Fresno-based [[Lao Veterans of America]] and [[The Centre for Public Policy Analysis]] organize delegations from the Central Valley, and Rep. Costa's district, that travel to Washington, D.C., and [[Arlington National Cemetery]] to play homage at the [[Laos Memorial]] and honor the Lao- and Hmong-American veterans, and their American advisers, who served and died with U.S. CIA [[Central Intelligence Agency]] clandestine and military forces during the [[Vietnam War]].<ref>Doyle, Michael,[http://www.modbee.com/2013/05/12/2712540/hmong-honor-dead-from-war.html#storylink=cpy "Central Valley Hmong among those honoring dead from war"], ''Modesto Bee'', May 12, 2013.</ref><ref> [http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/WO1205/S00337/laos-hmong-veterans-honored-at-national-ceremonies.htm "Laos, Hmong Veterans Honored At National Ceremonies"], Scoop Independent News, Auckland, New Zealand, May 15, 2012.</ref><ref>[http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130512005048/en/Laos-Hmong-Veterans-Vietnam-War-Honored-National "Laos, Hmong Veterans of Vietnam War Honored At National Ceremonies"], businesswire.com, May 12, 2013.</ref>

===Political campaigns===
;2004
In 2004, Costa entered the Democratic primary for the 20th District, which was opened up by the retirement of its seven-term incumbent, [[Cal Dooley]]. Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]], endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] state senator [[Roy Ashburn]] in November.

The 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave [[Al Gore]] his highest vote total outside the state's two large [[conurbation]]s ([[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the north and [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] to the south).  Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, "Costa's going to cost ya," and linked him to former Governor [[Gray Davis]], calling them "two taxing twins". Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican [[Kings County, California|Kings County]].

;2006
Costa ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources|Natural Resources Committee]]'s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]].

;2008
Costa was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2010#District 20}}
Costa was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee [[Andy Vidak]]. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after Election Day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-200878-1.html|title=Costa Holds Seat, Keeps GOP Pickups at 63: Roll Call Politics|publisher=Rollcall.com|date=2010-11-23|accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 votes (48.2%) for Vidak.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 16}}
For his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and [[Bakersfield]]. However, redistricting following the 2010 Census renumbered his district as the 21st district and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa officially announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th District, a much more compact district including most of Fresno, as well as most of [[Merced, California|Merced]].<ref name="Announces 2012">{{cite news|title=Rep.

After the new districts were announced, it was reported that the [[National Republican Congressional Committee|NRCC]] considered Costa vulnerable to defeat.<ref name="Redistricting Gains">{{cite news|title=Republicans Tout Redistricting Gains|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2012/03/republicans-tou-1.php|newspaper=National Journal|date=March 28, 2012}}</ref> 

In November 2011, the [[League of Conservation Voters]] ran a series of TV ads in Costa's district criticizing his environmental record.<ref name="Right and left">{{cite news|title=Jim Costa responds to attacks from the right, and the left|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/politics&id=8429406|newspaper=ABC News}}</ref> Costa was reelected in 2012 with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/CA/house/16|title=U.S. House: California District 16 - 2012 Election Center|work=CNN}}</ref>

Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]], endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] state senator [[Roy Ashburn]] in November.

The 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave [[Al Gore]] his highest vote total outside the state's two large [[conurbation]]s ([[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the north and [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] to the south).  Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, "Costa's going to cost ya," and linked him to former Governor [[Gray Davis]], calling them "two taxing twins". Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican [[Kings County, California|Kings County]].

;2006
Costa ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources|Natural Resources Committee]]'s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]].

;2008
Costa was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.

;2010

Costa was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee [[Andy Vidak]]. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after Election Day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-200878-1.html|title=Costa Holds Seat, Keeps GOP Pickups at 63: Roll Call Politics|publisher=Rollcall.com|date=2010-11-23|accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 votes (48.2%) for Vidak.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 16}}
For his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and [[Bakersfield]]. However, redistricting following the 2010 Census renumbered his district as the 21st district and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa officially announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th District, a much more compact district including most of Fresno, as well as most of [[Merced, California|Merced]].<ref name="Announces 2012">{{cite news|title=Rep.

In November 2011, the [[League of Conservation Voters]] ran a series of TV ads in Costa's district criticizing his environmental record.<ref name="Right and left">{{cite news|title=Jim Costa responds to attacks from the right, and the left|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/politics&id=8429406|newspaper=ABC News}}</ref> Costa was reelected in 2012 with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/CA/house/16|title=U.S. House: California District 16 - 2012 Election Center|work=CNN}}</ref>
