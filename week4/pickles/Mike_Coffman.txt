'''Michael "Mike" Coffman''' (born March 19, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CO|6}}, serving since 2009. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as the  [[Secretary of State of Colorado]] (2007–2009) and as [[Colorado State Treasurer]] (1999–2005 & 2006–2007).

==Early life, education, and business career==
Michael Coffman was born on March 19, 1955 at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]], to Harold and Dorothy Coffman, and is one of five children. His father served in the [[United States Army]] at Fort Leonard Wood, and after 1964, at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], under the [[G.I. Bill]] graduating in 1979 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].<ref>[http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-coffman--CO-H Mike Coffman (R), WINNER U.S. Representative - CO6], Election 2012, [[Wall Street Journal]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coffman Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=Mike Coffman U.S. Representative|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> He also studied at [[DG Vaishnav College|Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and the [[University of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] for a year. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserves]], serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based [[property management]] firm, serving as senior [[shareholder]] until 2000.

==State politics==

===Legislature===
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1995. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave-of-absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service.  Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again. When State Senator [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] resigned his seat to become state treasurer, the party's vacancy committee named Coffman the replacement in December 1994. In 1996, he was elected to a full term to the [[Colorado State Senate]] unopposed.<ref>http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/ElectionArchives/1996/General/1996StateSenateResults.pdf {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> He became the Chairman of the Finance Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=House of Representatives|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Statewide offices===
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=882|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 03, 1998|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator [[Terry Phillips (politician)|Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=878|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], where he helped support the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]], which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected [[Colorado Secretary of State]] with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=179258|title=Our Campaigns - CO Secretary of State Race - Nov 07, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Elections===
;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Colorado, 2008#District 6}}

Coffman announced that he would run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Republican [[Tom Tancredo]] in 2008 in [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]]. Three other candidates decided to run in the Republican primary for the open seat: Wil Armstrong (son of former U.S. Senator [[William L. Armstrong|Bill Armstrong]]), State Senator [[Ted Harvey]], and State Senator [[Steve Ward (Colorado legislator)|Steve Ward]]. Coffman won the August primary with a plurality of 40% of the vote, beating runner-up Wil Armstrong by seven points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=384928|title=Our Campaigns - CO District 6 - R Primary Race - Aug 12, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

During the general election, several groups accused the secretary of state's office of improperly marking 6,400 voter registration forms as incomplete, because they failed to check a box on the form, required by legislation sponsored by then Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, a Democrat, in 2006. Incomplete registrations require voters to either re-register or provide extra identification when they go to vote.<ref name=RockyMountainNews_Kim_20081014>{{cite web | url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/14/voting-forms-ruled-incomplete-for-lack-of-check/ | title=Voting forms ruled incomplete for lack of check mark | first=Myung Oak |last=Kim | work=Rocky Mountain News | date=October 14, 2008 | accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> Soon after the accusations were made, [[Common Cause]] filed suit against Coffman, in his official capacity as secretary of state.

===Tenure===
In 2011, Coffman proposed a half billion dollars in cuts to military programs such as education reimbursements, the [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] and the military's health plan, [[Tricare|TRICARE]], saying that the programs "have been neglected for a long time.

In response to a 2013 ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|Gazette]]'' report about veterans with mental health conditions, such as [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]], being stripped of medical benefits, Coffman sponsored a 2014 amendment that would allow servicemen with mental health issues who were discharged because of misconduct to appeal for medical discharge instead.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Philipps|first1=Dave|title=Path cleared for Coffman measure to protect vets|url=http://gazette.com/path-cleared-for-coffman-measure-to-protect-vets/article/1520852|accessdate=July 3, 2014|publisher=The Gazette|date=6/2/14}}</ref>

On March 14, 2014, Coffman introduced the [[Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4261; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA).

'''Michael "Mike" Coffman''' (born March 19, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CO|6}}, serving since 2009. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as the  [[Secretary of State of Colorado]] (2007–2009) and as [[Colorado State Treasurer]] (1999–2005 & 2006–2007).

==Early life, education, and business career==
Michael Coffman was born on March 19, 1955 at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]], to Harold and Dorothy Coffman, and is one of five children. His father served in the [[United States Army]] at Fort Leonard Wood, and after 1964, at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], under the [[G.I. Bill]] graduating in 1979 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].<ref>[http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-coffman--CO-H Mike Coffman (R), WINNER U.S. Representative - CO6], Election 2012, [[Wall Street Journal]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coffman Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=Mike Coffman U.S. Representative|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> He also studied at [[DG Vaishnav College|Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and the [[University of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] for a year. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserves]], serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based [[property management]] firm, serving as senior [[shareholder]] until 2000.

==State politics==

===Legislature===
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1995. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave-of-absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service.  Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again. When State Senator [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] resigned his seat to become state treasurer, the party's vacancy committee named Coffman the replacement in December 1994. In 1996, he was elected to a full term to the [[Colorado State Senate]] unopposed.<ref>http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/ElectionArchives/1996/General/1996StateSenateResults.pdf {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> He became the Chairman of the Finance Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=House of Representatives|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Statewide offices===
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=882|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 03, 1998|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator [[Terry Phillips (politician)|Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=878|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], where he helped support the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]], which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected [[Colorado Secretary of State]] with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=179258|title=Our Campaigns - CO Secretary of State Race - Nov 07, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Colorado, 2008#District 6}}

Coffman announced that he would run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Republican [[Tom Tancredo]] in 2008 in [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]]. Three other candidates decided to run in the Republican primary for the open seat: Wil Armstrong (son of former U.S. Senator [[William L. Armstrong|Bill Armstrong]]), State Senator [[Ted Harvey]], and State Senator [[Steve Ward (Colorado legislator)|Steve Ward]]. Coffman won the August primary with a plurality of 40% of the vote, beating runner-up Wil Armstrong by seven points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=384928|title=Our Campaigns - CO District 6 - R Primary Race - Aug 12, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

During the general election, several groups accused the secretary of state's office of improperly marking 6,400 voter registration forms as incomplete, because they failed to check a box on the form, required by legislation sponsored by then Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, a Democrat, in 2006. Incomplete registrations require voters to either re-register or provide extra identification when they go to vote.<ref name=RockyMountainNews_Kim_20081014>{{cite web | url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/14/voting-forms-ruled-incomplete-for-lack-of-check/ | title=Voting forms ruled incomplete for lack of check mark | first=Myung Oak |last=Kim | work=Rocky Mountain News | date=October 14, 2008 | accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> Soon after the accusations were made, [[Common Cause]] filed suit against Coffman, in his official capacity as secretary of state.

===Tenure===
In 2011, Coffman proposed a half billion dollars in cuts to military programs such as education reimbursements, the [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] and the military's health plan, [[Tricare|TRICARE]], saying that the programs "have been neglected for a long time.  Every dollar wasted is a dollar not going to our war fighters.  What they do is important to this country, and we should focus on them."<ref>Sherry, Allison.

In response to a 2013 ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|Gazette]]'' report about veterans with mental health conditions, such as [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]], being stripped of medical benefits, Coffman sponsored a 2014 amendment that would allow servicemen with mental health issues who were discharged because of misconduct to appeal for medical discharge instead.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Philipps|first1=Dave|title=Path cleared for Coffman measure to protect vets|url=http://gazette.com/path-cleared-for-coffman-measure-to-protect-vets/article/1520852|accessdate=July 3, 2014|publisher=The Gazette|date=6/2/14}}</ref>

On March 14, 2014, Coffman introduced the [[Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4261; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA).

'''Michael "Mike" Coffman''' (born March 19, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CO|6}}, serving since 2009. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as the  [[Secretary of State of Colorado]] (2007–2009) and as [[Colorado State Treasurer]] (1999–2005 & 2006–2007).

==Early life, education, and business career==
Michael Coffman was born on March 19, 1955 at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]], to Harold and Dorothy Coffman, and is one of five children. His father served in the [[United States Army]] at Fort Leonard Wood, and after 1964, at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], under the [[G.I. Bill]] graduating in 1979 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].<ref>[http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-coffman--CO-H Mike Coffman (R), WINNER U.S. Representative - CO6], Election 2012, [[Wall Street Journal]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coffman Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=Mike Coffman U.S. Representative|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> He also studied at [[DG Vaishnav College|Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and the [[University of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] for a year. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserves]], serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based [[property management]] firm, serving as senior [[shareholder]] until 2000.

==State politics==

===Legislature===
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1995. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave-of-absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service.  Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again. When State Senator [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] resigned his seat to become state treasurer, the party's vacancy committee named Coffman the replacement in December 1994. In 1996, he was elected to a full term to the [[Colorado State Senate]] unopposed.<ref>http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/ElectionArchives/1996/General/1996StateSenateResults.pdf {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> He became the Chairman of the Finance Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=House of Representatives|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Statewide offices===
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=882|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 03, 1998|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator [[Terry Phillips (politician)|Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=878|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], where he helped support the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]], which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected [[Colorado Secretary of State]] with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=179258|title=Our Campaigns - CO Secretary of State Race - Nov 07, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Elections===
;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Colorado, 2008#District 6}}

Coffman announced that he would run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Republican [[Tom Tancredo]] in 2008 in [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]]. Three other candidates decided to run in the Republican primary for the open seat: Wil Armstrong (son of former U.S. Senator [[William L. Armstrong|Bill Armstrong]]), State Senator [[Ted Harvey]], and State Senator [[Steve Ward (Colorado legislator)|Steve Ward]]. Coffman won the August primary with a plurality of 40% of the vote, beating runner-up Wil Armstrong by seven points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=384928|title=Our Campaigns - CO District 6 - R Primary Race - Aug 12, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

During the general election, several groups accused the secretary of state's office of improperly marking 6,400 voter registration forms as incomplete, because they failed to check a box on the form, required by legislation sponsored by then Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, a Democrat, in 2006. Incomplete registrations require voters to either re-register or provide extra identification when they go to vote.<ref name=RockyMountainNews_Kim_20081014>{{cite web | url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/14/voting-forms-ruled-incomplete-for-lack-of-check/ | title=Voting forms ruled incomplete for lack of check mark | first=Myung Oak |last=Kim | work=Rocky Mountain News | date=October 14, 2008 | accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> Soon after the accusations were made, [[Common Cause]] filed suit against Coffman, in his official capacity as secretary of state.

In response to a 2013 ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|Gazette]]'' report about veterans with mental health conditions, such as [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]], being stripped of medical benefits, Coffman sponsored a 2014 amendment that would allow servicemen with mental health issues who were discharged because of misconduct to appeal for medical discharge instead.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Philipps|first1=Dave|title=Path cleared for Coffman measure to protect vets|url=http://gazette.com/path-cleared-for-coffman-measure-to-protect-vets/article/1520852|accessdate=July 3, 2014|publisher=The Gazette|date=6/2/14}}</ref>

On March 14, 2014, Coffman introduced the [[Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4261; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA). The bill would make the RAC an independent organization within the VA, require that a majority of the RAC's members be appointed by Congress instead of the VA, and state the RAC can release its reports without needing prior approval from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.<ref name=CoffmanPRmar14>{{cite web|last=Coffman|first=Mike|title=Bipartisan Bill on Gulf War Health Research|url=http://coffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bipartisan-bill-on-gulf-war-health-research|publisher=House Office of Mike Coffman|accessdate=May 27, 2014|date=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=USAtoday14mar>{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Kelly|title=Congress seeks independence for Gulf War illness board|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/03/14/house-demands-independence-from-va-for-gulf-war-illness-advisory-board/6428299/|accessdate=May 27, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=March 14, 2014}}</ref> The RAC is responsible for investigating [[Gulf War syndrome]], a chronic multisymptom disorder affecting returning military [[veterans]] and civilian workers of the [[Gulf War]].<ref name=veteranIllnesses>{{cite web | url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/associated_illnesses.asp | title = Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Illnesses Associated with Gulf War Service | date = n.d. | accessdate = May 9, 2012 | publisher = United States Department of Veterans Affairs }}</ref>

'''Michael "Mike" Coffman''' (born March 19, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CO|6}}, serving since 2009. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as the  [[Secretary of State of Colorado]] (2007–2009) and as [[Colorado State Treasurer]] (1999–2005 & 2006–2007).

==Early life, education, and business career==
Michael Coffman was born on March 19, 1955 at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]], to Harold and Dorothy Coffman, and is one of five children. His father served in the [[United States Army]] at Fort Leonard Wood, and after 1964, at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], under the [[G.I. Bill]] graduating in 1979 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].<ref>[http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-coffman--CO-H Mike Coffman (R), WINNER U.S. Representative - CO6], Election 2012, [[Wall Street Journal]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coffman Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=Mike Coffman U.S. Representative|accessdate=2 December 2014}}</ref> He also studied at [[DG Vaishnav College|Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and the [[University of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] for a year. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserves]], serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based [[property management]] firm, serving as senior [[shareholder]] until 2000.

==State politics==

===Legislature===
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1995. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave-of-absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service.  Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again. When State Senator [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] resigned his seat to become state treasurer, the party's vacancy committee named Coffman the replacement in December 1994. In 1996, he was elected to a full term to the [[Colorado State Senate]] unopposed.<ref>http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/ElectionArchives/1996/General/1996StateSenateResults.pdf {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> He became the Chairman of the Finance Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=House of Representatives|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Statewide offices===
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=882|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 03, 1998|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator [[Terry Phillips (politician)|Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=878|title=Our Campaigns - CO Treasurer Race - Nov 05, 2002|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], where he helped support the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]], which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected [[Colorado Secretary of State]] with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=179258|title=Our Campaigns - CO Secretary of State Race - Nov 07, 2006|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

===Elections===
;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Colorado, 2008#District 6}}

Coffman announced that he would run for the U.S. House seat being vacated by retiring Republican [[Tom Tancredo]] in 2008 in [[Colorado's 6th congressional district]]. Three other candidates decided to run in the Republican primary for the open seat: Wil Armstrong (son of former U.S. Senator [[William L. Armstrong|Bill Armstrong]]), State Senator [[Ted Harvey]], and State Senator [[Steve Ward (Colorado legislator)|Steve Ward]]. Coffman won the August primary with a plurality of 40% of the vote, beating runner-up Wil Armstrong by seven points.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=384928|title=Our Campaigns - CO District 6 - R Primary Race - Aug 12, 2008|publisher=|accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

During the general election, several groups accused the secretary of state's office of improperly marking 6,400 voter registration forms as incomplete, because they failed to check a box on the form, required by legislation sponsored by then Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, a Democrat, in 2006. Incomplete registrations require voters to either re-register or provide extra identification when they go to vote.<ref name=RockyMountainNews_Kim_20081014>{{cite web | url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/14/voting-forms-ruled-incomplete-for-lack-of-check/ | title=Voting forms ruled incomplete for lack of check mark | first=Myung Oak |last=Kim | work=Rocky Mountain News | date=October 14, 2008 | accessdate=October 24, 2008}}</ref> Soon after the accusations were made, [[Common Cause]] filed suit against Coffman, in his official capacity as secretary of state.

===Tenure===
In 2011, Coffman proposed a half billion dollars in cuts to military programs such as education reimbursements, the [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] and the military's health plan, [[Tricare|TRICARE]], saying that the programs "have been neglected for a long time.  Every dollar wasted is a dollar not going to our war fighters.  What they do is important to this country, and we should focus on them."<ref>Sherry, Allison. [http://www.denverpost.com/politics/ci_17896394 "Coffman's proposed military cuts face strong opposition."] ''Denver Post'', April 21, 2011.</ref>

In response to a 2013 ''[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|Gazette]]'' report about veterans with mental health conditions, such as [[Post-traumatic stress disorder]], being stripped of medical benefits, Coffman sponsored a 2014 amendment that would allow servicemen with mental health issues who were discharged because of misconduct to appeal for medical discharge instead.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Philipps|first1=Dave|title=Path cleared for Coffman measure to protect vets|url=http://gazette.com/path-cleared-for-coffman-measure-to-protect-vets/article/1520852|accessdate=July 3, 2014|publisher=The Gazette|date=6/2/14}}</ref>

On March 14, 2014, Coffman introduced the [[Gulf War Health Research Reform Act of 2014 (H.R. 4261; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would alter the relationship between the Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Illnesses (RAC) and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]] (VA). The bill would make the RAC an independent organization within the VA, require that a majority of the RAC's members be appointed by Congress instead of the VA, and state the RAC can release its reports without needing prior approval from the Secretary of Veterans Affairs.<ref name=CoffmanPRmar14>{{cite web|last=Coffman|first=Mike|title=Bipartisan Bill on Gulf War Health Research|url=http://coffman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/bipartisan-bill-on-gulf-war-health-research|publisher=House Office of Mike Coffman|accessdate=May 27, 2014|date=March 14, 2014}}</ref><ref name=USAtoday14mar>{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Kelly|title=Congress seeks independence for Gulf War illness board|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2014/03/14/house-demands-independence-from-va-for-gulf-war-illness-advisory-board/6428299/|accessdate=May 27, 2014|newspaper=USA Today|date=March 14, 2014}}</ref> The RAC is responsible for investigating [[Gulf War syndrome]], a chronic multisymptom disorder affecting returning military [[veterans]] and civilian workers of the [[Gulf War]].<ref name=veteranIllnesses>{{cite web | url = http://www.publichealth.va.gov/exposures/gulfwar/associated_illnesses.asp | title = Gulf War Veterans' Illnesses: Illnesses Associated with Gulf War Service | date = n.d. | accessdate = May 9, 2012 | publisher = United States Department of Veterans Affairs }}</ref>
