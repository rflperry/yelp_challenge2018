==Political positions==
Marchant worked closely with Bush when he was [[governor of Texas]], and bills himself as a staunch conservative.  However, he has occasionally broken ranks with the GOP, as he did to increase the [[minimum wage]].<ref>[http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/dn/opinion/points/stories/DN-mckenzie_20edi.ART.State.Edition1.379bba4.html Works well with others? What a flaw! | Dallas Morning News | News for Dallas, Texas | Opinion: Points<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> He has said that his top priority on [[Capitol Hill]] will be cutting the federal [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] with [[fiscal conservative]] policies.  The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, Marchant has the fifth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog - Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on August 8, 2008</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Marchant had planned to run for Congress two years earlier in a bid to represent the newly created {{ushr|Texas|32|32nd district}} in suburban Dallas, but fellow Republican [[Pete Sessions]], an incumbent, chose to run there instead. During the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Marchant, in his position on the Texas House's Redistricting Committee, was ideally positioned to help draw Texas districts.  As part of this effort, the 24th District, represented by 13-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Martin Frost]], was reconfigured from a heavily Democratic district with a sizable Latino population into a heavily Republican district that was over 73 percent white.  While [[Al Gore]] easily carried the old 24th in the 2000 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] would have won the new 24th with a staggering 68 percent of the vote.  Marchant was elected to Congress in 2004, and was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast).

==Personal life==
Marchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children as well as two grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kenny|url=http://marchant.house.gov/biography/}}</ref> They live in [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], a Dallas suburb.
Marchant's son Matthew Marchant is the current mayor of [[Carrollton, Texas]].

The [[Sunlight Foundation]] pointed out that among the 435 members of the U.S. House of Representatives in 2008, Marchant has the fifth-highest amount of investment in oil stocks.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Sunlight Foundation Blog - Oil Industry Influence: Personal Finances'|date=August 8, 2008 |url= http://blog.sunlightfoundation.com/2008/08/08/oil-industry-influence-personal-finances/|publisher=Sunlight Foundation}} Retrieved on August 8, 2008</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Marchant had planned to run for Congress two years earlier in a bid to represent the newly created {{ushr|Texas|32|32nd district}} in suburban Dallas, but fellow Republican [[Pete Sessions]], an incumbent, chose to run there instead. During the [[2003 Texas redistricting]], Marchant, in his position on the Texas House's Redistricting Committee, was ideally positioned to help draw Texas districts.  As part of this effort, the 24th District, represented by 13-term [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Martin Frost]], was reconfigured from a heavily Democratic district with a sizable Latino population into a heavily Republican district that was over 73 percent white.  While [[Al Gore]] easily carried the old 24th in the 2000 presidential election, [[George W. Bush]] would have won the new 24th with a staggering 68 percent of the vote.  Marchant was elected to Congress in 2004, and was reelected in 2006 (with 60% of the ballots cast) and 2008 (with 56% of the ballots cast).

==Personal life==
Marchant is married to Donna Marchant and has four children as well as two grandchildren.<ref>{{cite web|title=About Kenny|url=http://marchant.house.gov/biography/}}</ref> They live in [[Coppell, Texas|Coppell]], a Dallas suburb.
Marchant's son Matthew Marchant is the current mayor of [[Carrollton, Texas]].
