===Regulatory reform===
In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name ="FreedomWorks">{{cite web|title=FreedomWorks Scorecard|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/robert-aderholt-0}}</ref>

===Social issues===
During the “[[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]]” rally in Washington on Jan 22, 2010, he said, “The issue of abortion and the sanctity of life is something that I feel strongly about and I encourage my colleagues to look for ways to curb and stop abortions in the United States, while compassionately educating on this important issue.”{{cn|date=September 2014}}

Aderholt is opposed to [[same-sex marriage]]. He has received high ratings from the [[Family Research Council]], the [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and the [[American Family Association]].{{sfn|VoteSmart|2012}}  In 2013, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Scorecard: Measuring Support for Equality in the 112th Congress|url=http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/112thCongressionalScorecard_2012.pdf#__utma=149406063.1555353042.1407266521.1407266533.1407268463.3&__utmb=149406063.1.10.1407268463&__utmc=149406063&__utmx=-&__utmz=149406063.1407268463.3.3.utmcsr=google|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Defense===
He does not support reducing the defense budget to close the [[United States public debt|American deficit]], and in May 2012 said "cuts to defense budgets - the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility - shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending".<ref>{{cite web|title=Redstone's Pivotal Role in Nation's Technology Must be Protected, says Rep. Robert Aderholt |url=http://aderholt.house.gov/common/popup/popup.cfm?action=item.print&itemID=1435 |publisher=AL.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> Aderholt opposes government spending to stimulate economic growth. He voted against the $787 Billion [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|Stimulus Package]] in February 2009.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

===Gun rights===
Aderholt is a supporter of the Second Amendment. He was endorsed by the NRA in the 2010 general election,<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama to present gun agenda; all but one Alabama representative supported by NRA|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Robert_Aderholt_Gun_Control.htm|publisher=On The Issues|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> and received $2000 from them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Aderholt on Gun Control|url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/01/national_rifle_association_bac.html|publisher=Challen Stevens|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Environmental issues===
During the 2013 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for the amendment by Rep. Scalise (R-LA)<ref group="Notes">H. Amendment: H.Amdt. 448 to H.R. 367</ref> which would "require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval.  Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass."{{sfn|Freedom Works|2013}} Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) which stated, "I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry."<ref>{{cite web|title=Inhofe Says EPA's New Boiler Rule Could Kill Nearly 800,000 Manufacturing Jobs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/28/inhofe-says-epas-new-boiler-rule-kill-nearly-manufacturing-jobs/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Aderholt was against the policies promoted by the [[Copenhagen Climate Change Conference]] as well as the US proposed Cap and Trade Bill, part of what he argued was an "unrealistic carbon emissions reduction mandate" that would result in a loss of American jobs. He agreed with the global warming petition project<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.petitionproject.org/|title=Global warming petition project|publisher=Global warming petition project|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref> that, "[t]here is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing, or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate."{{sfn|Aderhodt|2010}}

On November 4, 1999, Aderholt voted in favor of the [[Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/vote.xpd?vote=h1999-570 |title=GovTrack: House Vote on Conference Report: S. 900 [106th&#93;: Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act |publisher=Govtrack.us |date=1999-11-04 |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref>  which some economists, including Nobel laureate [[Joseph Stiglitz]], believe helped create the [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|2007 financial crisis]].{{sfn|Baram|2008}}{{sfn|Paletta|2009}}

==Political campaigns==
As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat "in the Tom Bevill tradition".

Aderholt won narrowly, 50%-48%, and hasn't faced serious opposition since.

===Regulatory reform===
In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name ="FreedomWorks">{{cite web|title=FreedomWorks Scorecard|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/robert-aderholt-0}}</ref>

===Social issues===
During the “[[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]]” rally in Washington on Jan 22, 2010, he said, “The issue of abortion and the sanctity of life is something that I feel strongly about and I encourage my colleagues to look for ways to curb and stop abortions in the United States, while compassionately educating on this important issue.”{{cn|date=September 2014}}

Aderholt is opposed to [[same-sex marriage]]. He has received high ratings from the [[Family Research Council]], the [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and the [[American Family Association]].{{sfn|VoteSmart|2012}}  In 2013, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Scorecard: Measuring Support for Equality in the 112th Congress|url=http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/112thCongressionalScorecard_2012.pdf#__utma=149406063.1555353042.1407266521.1407266533.1407268463.3&__utmb=149406063.1.10.1407268463&__utmc=149406063&__utmx=-&__utmz=149406063.1407268463.3.3.utmcsr=google|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Defense===
He does not support reducing the defense budget to close the [[United States public debt|American deficit]], and in May 2012 said "cuts to defense budgets - the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility - shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending".<ref>{{cite web|title=Redstone's Pivotal Role in Nation's Technology Must be Protected, says Rep. Robert Aderholt |url=http://aderholt.house.gov/common/popup/popup.cfm?action=item.print&itemID=1435 |publisher=AL.com |accessdate=November 19, 2012}}</ref> Aderholt opposes government spending to stimulate economic growth. He voted against the $787 Billion [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|Stimulus Package]] in February 2009.{{cn|date=September 2014}}

===Gun rights===
Aderholt is a supporter of the Second Amendment. He was endorsed by the NRA in the 2010 general election,<ref>{{cite web|title=Obama to present gun agenda; all but one Alabama representative supported by NRA|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Robert_Aderholt_Gun_Control.htm|publisher=On The Issues|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref> and received $2000 from them.<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert Aderholt on Gun Control|url=http://blog.al.com/wire/2013/01/national_rifle_association_bac.html|publisher=Challen Stevens|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Environmental issues===
During the 2013 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for the amendment by Rep. Scalise (R-LA)<ref group="Notes">H. Amendment: H.Amdt. 448 to H.R. 367</ref> which would "require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval.  Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass."{{sfn|Freedom Works|2013}} Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) which stated, "I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry."<ref>{{cite web|title=Inhofe Says EPA's New Boiler Rule Could Kill Nearly 800,000 Manufacturing Jobs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/28/inhofe-says-epas-new-boiler-rule-kill-nearly-manufacturing-jobs/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Aderholt was against the policies promoted by the [[Copenhagen Climate Change Conference]] as well as the US proposed Cap and Trade Bill, part of what he argued was an "unrealistic carbon emissions reduction mandate" that would result in a loss of American jobs. He agreed with the global warming petition project<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.petitionproject.org/|title=Global warming petition project|publisher=Global warming petition project|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref> that, "[t]here is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing, or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate."{{sfn|Aderhodt|2010}}

As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat "in the Tom Bevill tradition".

Aderholt won narrowly, 50%-48%, and hasn't faced serious opposition since.

In December 2011, Aderholt voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name ="FreedomWorks">{{cite web|title=FreedomWorks Scorecard|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/robert-aderholt-0}}</ref>

He does not support reducing the defense budget to close the [[United States public debt|American deficit]], and in May 2012 said "cuts to defense budgets - the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility - shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending".<ref>{{cite web|title=Redstone's Pivotal Role in Nation's Technology Must be Protected, says Rep.

During the 2013 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for the amendment by Rep. Scalise (R-LA)<ref group="Notes">H. Amendment: H.Amdt. 448 to H.R. 367</ref> which would "require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval.  Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass."{{sfn|Freedom Works|2013}} Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) which stated, "I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry."<ref>{{cite web|title=Inhofe Says EPA's New Boiler Rule Could Kill Nearly 800,000 Manufacturing Jobs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/28/inhofe-says-epas-new-boiler-rule-kill-nearly-manufacturing-jobs/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Aderholt was against the policies promoted by the [[Copenhagen Climate Change Conference]] as well as the US proposed Cap and Trade Bill, part of what he argued was an "unrealistic carbon emissions reduction mandate" that would result in a loss of American jobs.

He has received high ratings from the [[Family Research Council]], the [[Traditional Values Coalition]], and the [[American Family Association]].{{sfn|VoteSmart|2012}}  In 2013, the [[Human Rights Campaign]] gave him a score of 0 on its Congressional Scorecard.<ref>{{cite web|title=Congressional Scorecard: Measuring Support for Equality in the 112th Congress|url=http://hrc-assets.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com//files/assets/resources/112thCongressionalScorecard_2012.pdf#__utma=149406063.1555353042.1407266521.1407266533.1407268463.3&__utmb=149406063.1.10.1407268463&__utmc=149406063&__utmx=-&__utmz=149406063.1407268463.3.3.utmcsr=google|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|accessdate=5 August 2014}}</ref>

===Defense===
He does not support reducing the defense budget to close the [[United States public debt|American deficit]], and in May 2012 said "cuts to defense budgets - the federal government's primary Constitutional responsibility - shouldn't be the relief valve for uncontrolled domestic program spending".<ref>{{cite web|title=Redstone's Pivotal Role in Nation's Technology Must be Protected, says Rep.

===Environmental issues===
During the 2013 111th Congress, Aderholt voted for the amendment by Rep. Scalise (R-LA)<ref group="Notes">H. Amendment: H.Amdt. 448 to H.R. 367</ref> which would "require that Congress be allowed to vote on any executive regulation that would impose any tax, price, or levy upon carbon emissions... effectively prevents the executive branch from levying any form of carbon tax without Congressional approval.  Since a carbon tax would be tremendously destructive to the economy as a whole, this measure would hopefully make such a tax unlikely to pass."{{sfn|Freedom Works|2013}} Aderholt opposed regulations on greenhouse gas emissions, and in December 2008 helped write a letter to the [[U.S. Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) which stated, "I am opposed to any attempt to impose greenhouse gas regulations under the Clean Air Act on the agricultural industry."<ref>{{cite web|title=Inhofe Says EPA's New Boiler Rule Could Kill Nearly 800,000 Manufacturing Jobs|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/09/28/inhofe-says-epas-new-boiler-rule-kill-nearly-manufacturing-jobs/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=19 November 2012|date=28 September 2010}}</ref> Aderholt was against the policies promoted by the [[Copenhagen Climate Change Conference]] as well as the US proposed Cap and Trade Bill, part of what he argued was an "unrealistic carbon emissions reduction mandate" that would result in a loss of American jobs. He agreed with the global warming petition project<ref>{{citation|url=http://www.petitionproject.org/|title=Global warming petition project|publisher=Global warming petition project|accessdate=21 September 2013}}</ref> that, "[t]here is no convincing scientific evidence that human release of carbon dioxide, methane, or other greenhouse gases is causing, or will in the foreseeable future, cause catastrophic heating of the Earth’s atmosphere and disruption of the Earth’s climate."{{sfn|Aderhodt|2010}}

==Political campaigns==
As the Republican nominee, Aderholt faced a considerable challenge against State Senator Bob Wilson Jr., who called himself a Democrat "in the Tom Bevill tradition".

Aderholt won narrowly, 50%-48%, and hasn't faced serious opposition since.
