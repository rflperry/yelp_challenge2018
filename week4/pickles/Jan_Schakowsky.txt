Schakowsky is by some accounts the most<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/spectrum.xpd |title=GovTrack: The Political Spectrum |publisher=Govtrack.us |date=October 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> [[Progressivism|Progressive]] member of the current US Congress.  She is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].  She frequently gains ratings of between 90 and 100 from liberal and progressive interest groups and lower ratings from conservative groups.

In April 2009 Schakowsky pointedly criticized the tax day [[Tea Party protests]], asserting that they were "an effort to mislead the public about the Obama economic plan that cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans and creates 3.5 million jobs." Schakowsky added, "It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt."<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/lawmaker-news/36720-schakowsky-tea-parties-despicable/ "Schakowsky: Tea parties 'despicable'"], by Eric Zimmerman, ''The Hill,'' April 16, 2009.</ref>

In Feb 2013, Schakowsky indicated her support for banning assault weapons as only a beginning step towards more gun control measures including a ban on handguns.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mattera|first=Jason|title=Democrat Congresswoman: Assault Weapons Ban 'Just the Beginning'|url=http://www.ijreview.com/2013/03/41206-congresswoman-says-assault-weapons-ban-just-the-beginning/|publisher=Independent Journal Review|accessdate=16 November 2013}}</ref>

As co-chair of the [[Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues]], Schakowsky has been known for her support of women's issues while in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/07/09/jan-schakowsky-leads-the-fight-for-women.html |title=Jan Schakowsky Leads the Fight for Women |work=US News and World Report |author=Rettig, Jessica |date=July 9, 2010}}</ref>

''[[The Nation]]'' endorsed her for vice president in the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], stating that she is 'the truest heir to [[Paul Wellstone]] in the current Congress'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?bid=1&pid=1295 |title=The Beat |work=The Nation |location=Abu Dhabi |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> She was, however, not selected as [[John Kerry]]'s running mate.

In response to concerns about electoral irregularities in the state of [[Ohio]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Schakowsky was one of 31 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who voted not to accept Ohio's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml</ref>

In hearings held by the House Energy and Commerce Subcomittee in July 2006, Schakowsky expressed concern that a report from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] showing discrepancies among scientists studying [[global warming]] might be "used in a way to discredit the whole notion that our country and the rest of the industrialized and developing world ought to do anything about global warming".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=072606G |title=Science In the House of Pain |publisher=TCS Daily |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref>

Schakowsky added, "It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt."<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/lawmaker-news/36720-schakowsky-tea-parties-despicable/ "Schakowsky: Tea parties 'despicable'"], by Eric Zimmerman, ''The Hill,'' April 16, 2009.</ref>

Schakowsky added, "It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt."<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/lawmaker-news/36720-schakowsky-tea-parties-despicable/ "Schakowsky: Tea parties 'despicable'"], by Eric Zimmerman, ''The Hill,'' April 16, 2009.</ref>

In April 2009 Schakowsky pointedly criticized the tax day [[Tea Party protests]], asserting that they were "an effort to mislead the public about the Obama economic plan that cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans and creates 3.5 million jobs." Schakowsky added, "It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt."<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/lawmaker-news/36720-schakowsky-tea-parties-despicable/ "Schakowsky: Tea parties 'despicable'"], by Eric Zimmerman, ''The Hill,'' April 16, 2009.</ref>

In August 2013 Schakowsky expressed support for increasing wages for fast food employees stating that increased wages would lead to "millions of new jobs" because of their increased spending ability.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

===1998===
[[Sidney R. Yates|Sidney Yates]], who had represented the 9th District since 1949 (except for an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1962), had announced in 1996 that he wouldn't run for re-election in 1998. Schakowsky easily won the Democratic primary, which all but assured her of election in the heavily Democratic 9th. She won in November with 75 percent of the vote and has easily won reelection four times with 70 percent or more of the vote. She is only the third person to represent the district since 1949.
