As a former teacher, Lipinski has pushed for improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education throughout his career. As chairman of the Research Subcommittee, Lipinski helped write the legislation reauthorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as the America COMPETES Act. In 2007, Lipinski was a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee that completed work on the COMPETES Act, a response to a National Academies report warning that America must take action if it wants to maintain its place as the world’s scientific and technological leader.

Among Lipinski’s other priorities are boosting domestic manufacturing and strengthening Buy American laws.

===Manufacturing===
Lipinski introduced the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act on June 12, 2012.<ref>[http://americanmanufacturing.org/blog/house-passes-bipartisan-manufacturing-competitiveness-act]</ref> The bill would require the government to implement policies that support manufacturing products that qualify for the "Made in U.S.A” label, such as the establishment of a Manufacturing Strategy Board within the Commerce Department that includes federal officials, two state governors from different parties, and nine private-sector leaders and stakeholders from the manufacturing industry.<ref>[http://swnewsherald.com/election-is-over-its-time-to-get-to-work-p2480-1.htm]</ref> The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2012, by a bipartisan 339-77 vote.<ref>[http://americanmanufacturing.org/blog/house-passes-bipartisan-manufacturing-competitiveness-act]</ref>

===Immigration===
Lipinski has voted against giving undocumented immigrants in-state tuition, educational benefits, welfare and health care services, and has opposed the visa lottery. He also has voted against increases in permanent and temporary foreign work visas such as the H1-B.<ref>{{cite web

  | url = http://immigrationstance.diggersrealm.com/il/representative_daniel_lipinskis_record_on_immigration_reform_and_illegal_aliens.html}}</ref>

===Domestic Surveillance===
Lipinski supports strong counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws. He voted for the Patriot Act re-authorization of 2006, the Protect America Act of 2007, the FISA Amendment act of 2008, the Patriot Act Extension of 2011, and the FISA Extension of 2012. He voted against the Amash Amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Lipinski is one of only two Democratic lawmakers to have supported counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws to that extent. <ref>http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/legvotes.aspx</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 2004, Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward—which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd—he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; not only had the younger Lipinski never run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Green Papers: Illinois 2004 General Election|url = http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/IL.phtml|accessdate = 2008-01-17}}</ref>  As expected, Lipinski trounced his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the 2004 general election. 

Lipinski was able to garner 55% of the vote in the 2006 primary against two Democratic opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski faced Republican Michael Bendas, and once again won with over 70% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.rollcall.com/race_detail/district-2010-IL-03.html?cqp=1]</ref>

==Personal life==
Before serving in Congress, Lipinski taught American Government at a number of colleges, including the University of Notre Dame. He also gained experience on Capitol Hill working for the House Administration Committee, the Democratic Policy Committee, and House members, including Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. Lipinski has also worked for the U.S. Department of Labor and the Illinois General Assembly's Commission on Intergovernmental Cooperation.

Lipinski earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University, a Master's degree in Engineering-Economic Systems from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in Political Science from Duke University. He is one of only a dozen trained engineers in the 113th Congress.

Lipinski and his wife, Judy, reside in Western Springs. In their free time, they are avid runners, participating in numerous races each year, from two-mile sprints to half-marathons.

Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat in Congress to oppose the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which passed the House on March 21, 2010.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml Roll Call 165, H.R. 3590]</ref> He said that he broke ranks with his party for a number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to abortion.<ref>{{cite news

===Immigration===
Lipinski has voted against giving undocumented immigrants in-state tuition, educational benefits, welfare and health care services, and has opposed the visa lottery. He also has voted against increases in permanent and temporary foreign work visas such as the H1-B.<ref>{{cite web

  | url = http://immigrationstance.diggersrealm.com/il/representative_daniel_lipinskis_record_on_immigration_reform_and_illegal_aliens.html}}</ref>

===Domestic Surveillance===
Lipinski supports strong counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws. He voted for the Patriot Act re-authorization of 2006, the Protect America Act of 2007, the FISA Amendment act of 2008, the Patriot Act Extension of 2011, and the FISA Extension of 2012. He voted against the Amash Amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Lipinski is one of only two Democratic lawmakers to have supported counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws to that extent. <ref>http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/legvotes.aspx</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 2004, Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward—which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd—he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; not only had the younger Lipinski never run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Green Papers: Illinois 2004 General Election|url = http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/IL.phtml|accessdate = 2008-01-17}}</ref>  As expected, Lipinski trounced his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the 2004 general election. 

Lipinski was able to garner 55% of the vote in the 2006 primary against two Democratic opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski faced Republican Michael Bendas, and once again won with over 70% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.rollcall.com/race_detail/district-2010-IL-03.html?cqp=1]</ref>

==Personal life==
Before serving in Congress, Lipinski taught American Government at a number of colleges, including the University of Notre Dame. He also gained experience on Capitol Hill working for the House Administration Committee, the Democratic Policy Committee, and House members, including Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. Lipinski has also worked for the U.S. Department of Labor and the Illinois General Assembly's Commission on Intergovernmental Cooperation.

Lipinski earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University, a Master's degree in Engineering-Economic Systems from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in Political Science from Duke University. He is one of only a dozen trained engineers in the 113th Congress.

Lipinski and his wife, Judy, reside in Western Springs. In their free time, they are avid runners, participating in numerous races each year, from two-mile sprints to half-marathons.

Like his father, Lipinski is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat by Chicago-area standards; his district has historically been the most conservative of the eight that divide Chicago (especially on social issues).<ref>{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=Richard E.

As a former teacher, Lipinski has pushed for improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education throughout his career. As chairman of the Research Subcommittee, Lipinski helped write the legislation reauthorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as the America COMPETES Act. In 2007, Lipinski was a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee that completed work on the COMPETES Act, a response to a National Academies report warning that America must take action if it wants to maintain its place as the world’s scientific and technological leader.

Among Lipinski’s other priorities are boosting domestic manufacturing and strengthening Buy American laws.

==Political positions==
Like his father, Lipinski is a moderate-to-conservative Democrat by Chicago-area standards; his district has historically been the most conservative of the eight that divide Chicago (especially on social issues).<ref>{{cite book |last=Barone |first=Michael |authorlink=Michael Barone (pundit) |author2=Richard E.

As a former teacher, Lipinski has pushed for improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education throughout his career. As chairman of the Research Subcommittee, Lipinski helped write the legislation reauthorizing the National Science Foundation (NSF) as well as the America COMPETES Act. In 2007, Lipinski was a member of the House-Senate Conference Committee that completed work on the COMPETES Act, a response to a National Academies report warning that America must take action if it wants to maintain its place as the world’s scientific and technological leader.

Among Lipinski’s other priorities are boosting domestic manufacturing and strengthening Buy American laws.

===Abortion===
Lipinski is [[pro-life]]<ref>[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2010-03-28/health/ct-met-kass-0328-20100328_1_white-house-bill-lipinski-voting Lipinski lonely but proud to be pro-life Democrat]</ref> and serves as co-chair of the bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.<ref>[http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/health-reform-implementation/139079-gop-fires-first-shots-in-2011-abortion-battle GOP fires first shots in 2011 abortion battle]</ref> He is a co-sponsor of the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]].<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20030292-503544.html Abortion Rights Activists Decry House Bill They Say Attempts to Redefine Rape]</ref> In June 2013, Lipinski was one of only six Democrats in Congress who voted for a nationwide 20-week abortion ban.<ref>[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/06/18/house-passes-20-week-abortion-ban-228-196/ House Passes 20-week Abortion Ban 228-196]</ref>

===Manufacturing===
Lipinski introduced the American Manufacturing Competitiveness Act on June 12, 2012.<ref>[http://americanmanufacturing.org/blog/house-passes-bipartisan-manufacturing-competitiveness-act]</ref> The bill would require the government to implement policies that support manufacturing products that qualify for the "Made in U.S.A” label, such as the establishment of a Manufacturing Strategy Board within the Commerce Department that includes federal officials, two state governors from different parties, and nine private-sector leaders and stakeholders from the manufacturing industry.<ref>[http://swnewsherald.com/election-is-over-its-time-to-get-to-work-p2480-1.htm]</ref> The U.S. House of Representatives passed the bill on September 12, 2012, by a bipartisan 339-77 vote.<ref>[http://americanmanufacturing.org/blog/house-passes-bipartisan-manufacturing-competitiveness-act]</ref>

===Jobs===
Lipinski has proposed what he calls a "Five-Point Jobs Plan". According to Lipinski, the plan would "strengthen manufacturing, modernize our infrastructure, educate the workforce, force other countries to trade fairly and invest in innovation."<ref>[http://swnewsherald.com/election-is-over-its-time-to-get-to-work-p2480-1.htm]</ref>

===Healthcare===
Lipinski was the only Illinois Democrat in Congress to oppose the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], which passed the House on March 21, 2010.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll165.xml Roll Call 165, H.R. 3590]</ref> He said that he broke ranks with his party for a number of reasons, including the bill's provisions related to abortion.<ref>{{cite news

In October 2013, Lipinski was the primary sponsor of HR3425, which would delay any penalties under the PPACA until four months after the program's website is fully functional.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/healthcare/188800-house-dems-propose-obamacare-delay-until-website-works|title=Nine Dems propose mandate delay|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|date=October 21, 2013|work=The Hill|accessdate=5 November 2013}}</ref>

===Immigration===
Lipinski has voted against giving undocumented immigrants in-state tuition, educational benefits, welfare and health care services, and has opposed the visa lottery. He also has voted against increases in permanent and temporary foreign work visas such as the H1-B.<ref>{{cite web
  | title = Representative Daniel Lipinski's Record On Immigration Reform And Illegal Aliens
  | url = http://immigrationstance.diggersrealm.com/il/representative_daniel_lipinskis_record_on_immigration_reform_and_illegal_aliens.html}}</ref>

===Domestic Surveillance===
Lipinski supports strong counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws. He voted for the Patriot Act re-authorization of 2006, the Protect America Act of 2007, the FISA Amendment act of 2008, the Patriot Act Extension of 2011, and the FISA Extension of 2012. He voted against the Amash Amendment to the 2013 National Defense Authorization Act. Lipinski is one of only two Democratic lawmakers to have supported counter-terrorism and domestic surveillance laws to that extent. <ref>http://clerk.house.gov/legislative/legvotes.aspx</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 2004, Lipinski's father ran for re-nomination in the Democratic primary. After easily winning the nomination, the elder Lipinski announced his retirement. As the Democratic committeeman for Chicago's 23rd Ward—which is virtually coextensive with the Chicago portion of the 3rd—he was able to persuade the state Democratic Party to select his son to replace him on the ballot. The move was somewhat controversial; not only had the younger Lipinski never run for elected office before, but it allowed him to sidestep the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.<ref>{{cite web| title = The Green Papers: Illinois 2004 General Election|url = http://www.thegreenpapers.com/G04/IL.phtml|accessdate = 2008-01-17}}</ref>  As expected, Lipinski trounced his Republican challenger, Ryan Chlada, in the 2004 general election. 

Lipinski was able to garner 55% of the vote in the 2006 primary against two Democratic opponents, and in the general election he defeated the Republican nominee, Raymond Wardingley, with 77% of the vote. Lipinski defeated three opponents in the 2008 Democratic primary and beat Republican Michael Hawkins in the general election with 73% of the vote. In the 2010 general election Lipinski faced Republican Michael Bendas, and once again won with over 70% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.rollcall.com/race_detail/district-2010-IL-03.html?cqp=1]</ref>

==Personal life==
Before serving in Congress, Lipinski taught American Government at a number of colleges, including the University of Notre Dame. He also gained experience on Capitol Hill working for the House Administration Committee, the Democratic Policy Committee, and House members, including Minority Leader Richard Gephardt. Lipinski has also worked for the U.S. Department of Labor and the Illinois General Assembly's Commission on Intergovernmental Cooperation.

Lipinski earned a bachelor's degree in Mechanical Engineering from Northwestern University, a Master's degree in Engineering-Economic Systems from Stanford University, and a Ph.D. in Political Science from Duke University. He is one of only a dozen trained engineers in the 113th Congress.

Lipinski and his wife, Judy, reside in Western Springs. In their free time, they are avid runners, participating in numerous races each year, from two-mile sprints to half-marathons.
