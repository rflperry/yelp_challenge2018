===2014 congressional election===
In March 2012, Mooney filed as a candidate in the 2014 Republican primary for {{ushr|MD|6}}.

===2014 congressional election===
In March 2012, Mooney filed as a candidate in the 2014 Republican primary for {{ushr|MD|6}}.  However, he subsequently had to withdraw his candidacy because he was still Bartlett's part-time outreach director at the time he filed papers to run in 2014.  House ethics rules do not allow congressional staffers to remain employed in a congressional office while campaigning.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/maryland-politics/post/bartlett-aide-state-gop-head-alex-mooney-drops-candidacy-to-comply-with-ethics-rules/2012/09/20/57c4c5f2-0358-11e2-9b24-ff730c7f6312_blog.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Ben | last=Pershing | title=Bartlett aide, state GOP head Alex Mooney drops candidacy to comply with ethics rules | date=September 20, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/blog/bs-md-mooney-campaign-20120922,0,4657671.story | work=The Baltimore Sun | first=Steve | last=Kilar | title=Bartlett aide admits he erred by not disavowing his own candidacy | date=September 22, 2012}}</ref>

Mooney subsequently moved to West Virginia and declared his candidacy for [[West Virginia's 2nd congressional district]].  Seven-term Republican incumbent [[Shelley Moore Capito]] was giving up the seat to run for the [[United States Senate]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Messina|first=Lawrence|title=2014 field growing in W.Va. federal races|url=http://www.wvgazette.com/News/201307140045|newspaper=Sunday Gazette-Mail|date=14 July 2013}}</ref> During his campaign, Mooney was accused by Democrats that he was a "carpetbagger," since he recently moved to West Virginia.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Livington|first1=Abby|title=At the Races — Roll Call's Politics Blog West Virginia Newcomer Battles Carpetbagger Label|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/newcomer-makes-case-for-capito-seat/|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Roll Call|date=10 July 2014}}</ref>

He received the Republican Party nomination on May 13 beating six other opponents in the Republican primary.
