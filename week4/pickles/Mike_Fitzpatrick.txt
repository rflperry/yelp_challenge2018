In January 1995, Fitzpatrick was appointed to the [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania#Politics|Bucks County Board of Commissioners]] by an 11-member panel of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|county]] judges. The appointment was made to fill the unexpired term of [[Mark Schweiker]], who had been elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]]. Fitzpatrick, who was an attorney at a firm active in county affairs, was the candidate preferred by county Republican Party leaders.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB32B72F34573A2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM The Philadelphia Inquirer]</ref> The appointment was not without controversy, however, as some claimed the judges had acted solely on the recommendation of the county Republican Party.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/92630225.html?dids=92630225:92630225&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+21%2C+1995&author=LESLIE+KLEIN+FUNK%2C+The+Morning+Call&pub=Morning+Call&desc=BUCKS+CANDIDATE+BLASTS+JUDGES+COMMISSIONER+HOPEFUL+SAYS+11+JURISTS+BLINDLY+CHOSE+RIVAL&pqatl=google The Morning Call]</ref>

===Elections===
;2004
In July 2004, popular moderate Republican [[James C. Greenwood]] unexpectedly withdrew from his re-election campaign. In the party convention held to select Greenwood's replacement on the ballot, the more conservative Fitzpatrick won the nomination over Greenwood's choice, state Senator [[Joe Conti]], thanks to the backing of Bucks County Republican Party boss Harry Fawkes. Fitzpatrick went on to face liberal activist Virginia "Ginny" Schrader (something of a "sacrificial lamb candidate", chosen before Greenwood withdrew) in the general election.<ref>[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12535985&BRD=1685&PAG=461&dept_id=45363&rfi=6 Doylestown Patriot - Schrader responds to Greenwood's retirement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2006/house/?state=PA 2006 House, Crystal Ball, U.Va<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fitzpatrick won the general election against Schrader 55.3%-44.3%, with the remaining vote split between two minor candidates.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://election.cbsnews.com/election2004/county/u_s__house_pa8.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Election Results - CBSNews.com}}</ref> The Pennsylvania 8th District includes all of [[Bucks County]], a sliver of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], and parts of two wards in [[Northeast Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dos.state.pa.us/bcel/lib/bcel/elections/cong_reap2003.pdf |title=Site Unavailable |publisher=Dos.state.pa.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#8th Congressional district}}
Fitzpatrick faced Democrat [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in the November general election of 2006.

In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives [[Bob Ney]] (R-OH), [[Tom DeLay]], (R-TX), and [[Randy Cunningham|Randy "Duke" Cunningham]] (R-CA).<ref>http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01222006-601349.html</ref>

Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the [[Sierra Club]]. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election.

The [[Cook Political Report]] rated the race as "Leans Republican". However, [[Congressional Quarterly]] pegged the contest as a "Toss-up". A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points.<ref>http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/election_tags/pa_08</ref>

In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast.

On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy.<ref>NBC10.com. [http://www.nbc10.com/politics/10271609/detail.html Fitzpatrick Concedes Defeat]. 2006-11-08.</ref> He along with [[Mike Sodrel]] (R-IN) and [[Joe Schwarz]] (R-MI) were the only freshman Republicans to be defeated in 2006 (the latter albeit in a primary).

===Tenure===
In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the [[Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006]], which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to "Commercial Social Networking Websites" and "Chat Rooms."

In late July, the DOPA Act overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, "The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5230506.stm | work=BBC News | title=Social network sites face US ban | date=July 31, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Committee assignments===
Fitzpatrick served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[United States House Committee on Small Business]].

==Inter-Congressional career (2007–2011)==
After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firm—and major Republican Party contributor<ref>[http://aboveavgjane.blogspot.com/2006/07/mike-fitzpatricks-political-origins.html Above Average Jane Blog:  Mike Fitzpatrick's Political Origins]</ref>—Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.<ref>[http://www.begleycarlin.com/Bio/MichaelFitzpatrick.asp Attorney Michael Fitzpatrick, Begley, Carlin & Mandio, Langhorne, Pennsylvania<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/113-12242007-1461181.html Pay to play not a given in Bucks (phillyBurbs.com) | Intelligencer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner [[Andy Warren (politician)|Andy Warren]] and former Common Pleas Judge [[William Hart Rufe]] to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation.<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/281-08152007-1392945.html Big push for open space support (phillyBurbs.com) | Outdoor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#8th Congressional district}}
Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy.<ref>[http://blogs.mcall.com/penn_ave/2007/09/add-a-name-to-t.html Mcall.com: Pennsylvania Ave. Blog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January, 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative [[Chris King (politician)|Chris King]] in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 142|142nd District]]. Despite charges by some Democrats that he was "afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose," Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his "passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community," as well as a desire to "change the way business is done in Harrisburg." <ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01212008-1474906.html Fitzpatrick to run for state House (phillyBurbs.com) | Courier Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

However, family health problems forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February. Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist [[Frank Farry]] (who went on to win the seat), and supported [[Doylestown Township, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]] pharmaceutical company executive [[Thomas Manion]] for the congressional seat he once held.

;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#8th Congressional district}}
Fitzpatrick faced Democrat [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in the November general election of 2006.

In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives [[Bob Ney]] (R-OH), [[Tom DeLay]], (R-TX), and [[Randy Cunningham|Randy "Duke" Cunningham]] (R-CA).<ref>http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01222006-601349.html</ref>

Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the [[Sierra Club]]. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election.

The [[Cook Political Report]] rated the race as "Leans Republican". However, [[Congressional Quarterly]] pegged the contest as a "Toss-up". A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points.<ref>http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/election_tags/pa_08</ref>

In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast.

On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy.<ref>NBC10.com. [http://www.nbc10.com/politics/10271609/detail.html Fitzpatrick Concedes Defeat]. 2006-11-08.</ref> He along with [[Mike Sodrel]] (R-IN) and [[Joe Schwarz]] (R-MI) were the only freshman Republicans to be defeated in 2006 (the latter albeit in a primary).

===Tenure===
In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the [[Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006]], which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to "Commercial Social Networking Websites" and "Chat Rooms."

In late July, the DOPA Act overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, "The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5230506.stm | work=BBC News | title=Social network sites face US ban | date=July 31, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

===Committee assignments===
Fitzpatrick served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[United States House Committee on Small Business]].

==Inter-Congressional career (2007–2011)==
After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firm—and major Republican Party contributor<ref>[http://aboveavgjane.blogspot.com/2006/07/mike-fitzpatricks-political-origins.html Above Average Jane Blog:  Mike Fitzpatrick's Political Origins]</ref>—Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.<ref>[http://www.begleycarlin.com/Bio/MichaelFitzpatrick.asp Attorney Michael Fitzpatrick, Begley, Carlin & Mandio, Langhorne, Pennsylvania<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/113-12242007-1461181.html Pay to play not a given in Bucks (phillyBurbs.com) | Intelligencer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner [[Andy Warren (politician)|Andy Warren]] and former Common Pleas Judge [[William Hart Rufe]] to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation.<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/281-08152007-1392945.html Big push for open space support (phillyBurbs.com) | Outdoor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2008#8th Congressional district}}
Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy.<ref>[http://blogs.mcall.com/penn_ave/2007/09/add-a-name-to-t.html Mcall.com: Pennsylvania Ave. Blog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January, 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative [[Chris King (politician)|Chris King]] in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 142|142nd District]]. Despite charges by some Democrats that he was "afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose," Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his "passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community," as well as a desire to "change the way business is done in Harrisburg." <ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01212008-1474906.html Fitzpatrick to run for state House (phillyBurbs.com) | Courier Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

However, family health problems forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February. Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist [[Frank Farry]] (who went on to win the seat), and supported [[Doylestown Township, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]] pharmaceutical company executive [[Thomas Manion]] for the congressional seat he once held.

After the loss to Murphy, Fitzpatrick re-entered the practice of law, taking a position with Middletown Township law firm—and major Republican Party contributor<ref>[http://aboveavgjane.blogspot.com/2006/07/mike-fitzpatricks-political-origins.html Above Average Jane Blog:  Mike Fitzpatrick's Political Origins]</ref>—Begley, Carlin, and Mandio.<ref>[http://www.begleycarlin.com/Bio/MichaelFitzpatrick.asp Attorney Michael Fitzpatrick, Begley, Carlin & Mandio, Langhorne, Pennsylvania<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/113-12242007-1461181.html Pay to play not a given in Bucks (phillyBurbs.com) | Intelligencer<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In the fall of 2007, the Bucks County Commissioners asked Fitzpatrick, along with former Commissioner [[Andy Warren (politician)|Andy Warren]] and former Common Pleas Judge [[William Hart Rufe]] to co-chair an effort to pass a ballot initiative authorizing the county to borrow $87 million for open space preservation.<ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/281-08152007-1392945.html Big push for open space support (phillyBurbs.com) | Outdoor<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  The initiative, which was also endorsed by Congressman Murphy, passed by a large margin.

Throughout 2007, there was much speculation that Fitzpatrick would seek to reclaim the seat in Congress that he lost to Murphy.<ref>[http://blogs.mcall.com/penn_ave/2007/09/add-a-name-to-t.html Mcall.com: Pennsylvania Ave. Blog<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  Fitzpatrick laid the rumors to rest in January, 2008 by announcing that he would not be running for Congress, but instead would challenge freshman State Representative [[Chris King (politician)|Chris King]] in the [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives, District 142|142nd District]]. Despite charges by some Democrats that he was "afraid to run against Murphy because he knows he would lose," Fitzpatrick claimed that he was interested in the job because of his "passion ... in solving local problems and serving the local community," as well as a desire to "change the way business is done in Harrisburg." <ref>[http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01212008-1474906.html Fitzpatrick to run for state House (phillyBurbs.com) | Courier Times<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

However, family health problems forced Fitzpatrick to end his bid for the State House in early February. Fitzpatrick yielded his spot on the ballot to Republican activist [[Frank Farry]] (who went on to win the seat), and supported [[Doylestown Township, Pennsylvania|Doylestown]] pharmaceutical company executive [[Thomas Manion]] for the congressional seat he once held.

'''Michael G. "Mike" Fitzpatrick''' (born June 28, 1963) is an American politician and member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] who serves as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|PA|8}}. He was first elected to Congress in 2004 and represented the district for from 2005 to 2007, but he was defeated by [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in 2006. He declined to seek a rematch with Murphy in 2008 but ran again in 2010, defeating Murphy and reclaiming the seat. He was re-elected in 2012 and 2014. A supporter of [[Term limits in the United States|term limits]], he will be retiring in 2016.

==Early life, education and law career==
Fitzpatrick was born and raised in [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|Bucks County]]. He graduated from [[Bishop Egan High School]], now Conwell-Egan Catholic High School,  in [[Fairless Hills, Pennsylvania|Fairless Hills]]. He moved to Florida to attend [[St. Thomas University (Florida)|St. Thomas University]] with an academic scholarship where he earned his bachelor's degree in 1985 from the school's honors program. He then earned his law degree from the [[Dickinson School of Law]] at [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State University]]. He was named business manager of the Dickinson Journal of International Law.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

After graduating law school in 1988, Fitzpatrick was admitted to the practice of law in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

==Bucks County Commission (1995–2005)==
In January 1995, Fitzpatrick was appointed to the [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania#Politics|Bucks County Board of Commissioners]] by an 11-member panel of [[Bucks County, Pennsylvania|county]] judges. The appointment was made to fill the unexpired term of [[Mark Schweiker]], who had been elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Pennsylvania|lieutenant governor]]. Fitzpatrick, who was an attorney at a firm active in county affairs, was the candidate preferred by county Republican Party leaders.<ref>[http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=PI&s_site=philly&p_multi=PI&p_theme=realcities&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB32B72F34573A2&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM The Philadelphia Inquirer]</ref> The appointment was not without controversy, however, as some claimed the judges had acted solely on the recommendation of the county Republican Party.<ref>[http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/mcall/access/92630225.html?dids=92630225:92630225&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jan+21%2C+1995&author=LESLIE+KLEIN+FUNK%2C+The+Morning+Call&pub=Morning+Call&desc=BUCKS+CANDIDATE+BLASTS+JUDGES+COMMISSIONER+HOPEFUL+SAYS+11+JURISTS+BLINDLY+CHOSE+RIVAL&pqatl=google The Morning Call]</ref>

===Elections===
;2004
In July 2004, popular moderate Republican [[James C. Greenwood]] unexpectedly withdrew from his re-election campaign. In the party convention held to select Greenwood's replacement on the ballot, the more conservative Fitzpatrick won the nomination over Greenwood's choice, state Senator [[Joe Conti]], thanks to the backing of Bucks County Republican Party boss Harry Fawkes. Fitzpatrick went on to face liberal activist Virginia "Ginny" Schrader (something of a "sacrificial lamb candidate", chosen before Greenwood withdrew) in the general election.<ref>[http://www.zwire.com/site/news.cfm?newsid=12535985&BRD=1685&PAG=461&dept_id=45363&rfi=6 Doylestown Patriot - Schrader responds to Greenwood's retirement<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/2006/house/?state=PA 2006 House, Crystal Ball, U.Va<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Fitzpatrick won the general election against Schrader 55.3%-44.3%, with the remaining vote split between two minor candidates.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://election.cbsnews.com/election2004/county/u_s__house_pa8.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Election Results - CBSNews.com}}</ref> The Pennsylvania 8th District includes all of [[Bucks County]], a sliver of [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery County]], and parts of two wards in [[Northeast Philadelphia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dos.state.pa.us/bcel/lib/bcel/elections/cong_reap2003.pdf |title=Site Unavailable |publisher=Dos.state.pa.us |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

;2006
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2006#8th Congressional district}}
Fitzpatrick faced Democrat [[Patrick Murphy (Pennsylvania politician)|Patrick Murphy]] in the November general election of 2006.

In January 2006, Fitzpatrick said he had donated to charity the $21,500 he received from political action committees headed by U.S. Representatives [[Bob Ney]] (R-OH), [[Tom DeLay]], (R-TX), and [[Randy Cunningham|Randy "Duke" Cunningham]] (R-CA).<ref>http://www.phillyburbs.com/pb-dyn/news/111-01222006-601349.html</ref>

Fitzpatrick was endorsed by several environmental groups including the [[Sierra Club]]. He was the only incumbent Republican congressman in Pennsylvania who had the support of the environmentalist lobby during this election.

The [[Cook Political Report]] rated the race as "Leans Republican". However, [[Congressional Quarterly]] pegged the contest as a "Toss-up". A poll released at the end of October showed Fitzpatrick trailing Murphy by three percentage points.<ref>http://electioncentral.tpmcafe.com/election_tags/pa_08</ref>

In the end, the election was decided by less than one percentage point, with Fitzpatrick initially trailing by just over 1,500 votes out of nearly 250,000 cast.

On November 8, with all precincts reporting, Murphy led by 1,521 votes. Philadelphia television station NBC 10 later reported that Fitzpatrick had conceded the election to Murphy.<ref>NBC10.com. [http://www.nbc10.com/politics/10271609/detail.html Fitzpatrick Concedes Defeat]. 2006-11-08.</ref> He along with [[Mike Sodrel]] (R-IN) and [[Joe Schwarz]] (R-MI) were the only freshman Republicans to be defeated in 2006 (the latter albeit in a primary).

===Tenure===
In May 2006, Fitzpatrick introduced the [[Deleting Online Predators Act of 2006]], which requires most schools and libraries to actively restrict minors from access to "Commercial Social Networking Websites" and "Chat Rooms."

In late July, the DOPA Act overwhelmingly passed the House. Speaking before the vote was taken, Fitzpatrick said, "The social networking sites have become, in a sense, a happy hunting ground for child predators".<ref>{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/5230506.stm | work=BBC News | title=Social network sites face US ban | date=July 31, 2006 | accessdate=May 12, 2010}}</ref>

Fitzpatrick served on the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services]] and the [[United States House Committee on Small Business]].
