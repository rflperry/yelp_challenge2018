I think it’s necessary if we are just trying to find the truth and hold individuals accountable. I think we need to see more of that in this government."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_5-21-13.htm |title=This is something that sends chills down regular Americans’ spines |date=May 21, 2013|publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>
