===Tenure and issues===

;Drunken and drugged driving

In 2006, Rice, the "state's toughest DWI prosecutor,"<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nassau-county-district-attorney-rice-joins-fight-leandra-law-article-1.414538|title=Nassau County District Attorney Rice joins fight for 'Leandra's Law'|date=November 14, 2009}}</ref> declared her first major policy initiative to be an “assault on the drunk driving epidemic.” She lowered the blood-alcohol level at which you could take a plea bargain,<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/14/nyregion/14drunk.html?pagewanted=print|title=A Harder Line on Driving While Drunk|date=March 14, 2006}}</ref> supported Leandra’s Law, and charged some drunk drivers who killed their victims with murder.<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/new-da-town-hillary-swear-kathleen-rice-nassau-article-1.635672|title=A NEW DA IN TOWN Hillary to swear in Kathleen Rice in Nassau|date=January 8, 2006}}</ref>
 
;Reform efforts

In September 2011, Rice’s office arrested seven students after uncovering an [[SAT]] cheating ring on Long Island.<ref>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/sat-cheating-ring-busted-york-students-arrested/story?id=14617306|title=SAT Cheating Ring Busted, Seven Students Arrested|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref> When this case led to the discovery of a wider-spread cheating scandal, Rice worked with the [[College Board]], who administers the test, to update security standards to halt cheating in the future. This effort sparked other test administrators, like that which gives the ACT{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2013}}, to update their standards as well.<ref>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/News/BacktoSchool/sat-security-ny-cheating-ring/story?id=16012528|title=New SAT Security Changes After N.Y.

Rice has also received credit for teen education programs geared towards cyber bullying, drug use, sexting and dangerous driving.<ref>{{cite web|work=FiOs1|url=http://www.fios1news.com/longisland/longisland/node/38822?quicktabs_1=0#.UmmufhaChUR|title=Nassau County DA Attacks Cyber Crime|date=July 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Nassau County District Attorney|url=http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/da/heroineawareness.html|title=Heroin Prevention PSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Anton News|url=http://www.antonnews.com/massapequanobserver/news/6347-dwi-education-program-at-local-schools.html|title=DWI Education Program at Local Schools|date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, Rice’s office, Nassau County and [[Hempstead (village)]] police led a counter-assault on Terrace Avenue, a major drug haven and crime-ridden street in [[Long Island]]’s Hempstead Village. Through a combination of zero-tolerance enforcement for repeat and violent offenders, and social-service based jail diversion for nonviolent and first time offenders, crime has been reduced in the area.<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/nyregion/long-island/18terraceli.html?_r=0|title=Street Known for Drug Crime Is Getting Clean|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref>

In 2008, following the trampling death of a [[Walmart]] employee at one of the retailer’s Black Friday sales events, Rice encouraged Walmart to upgrade its security protocols at its nearly 100 New York stores.<ref>{{cite web|work=USA Today|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2009-05-06-walmart-death_N.htm|title=Wal-Mart pays $2M to avoid charges in death probe|date=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

In 2012, Rice came out in favor of decriminalizing small amounts of “plain view” marijuana.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Village Voice|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/06/cuomos_plan_to.php|title=Cuomo's Plan To Decriminalize Weed In "Public View" Has Support Of Pretty Much Everyone|date=June 4, 2012}}</ref> Rice has also supported efforts to allow some citizens to seal prior low-level, non-violent convictions in the hopes of improving their chances of obtaining employment.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.pfa-li.com/sealrecs.html|title=Debate over sealing records on old crimes|date=June 4, 2012}}</ref>

Rice was chosen by Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] to be a member of the Moreland Commission on Utility Storm Preparation and Response, a panel tasked with investigating the failures of the [[Long Island Power Authority]] (LIPA) following Hurricane Sandy of October 2012. The panel recommended that LIPA be replaced by a private, investor-owned company and that the Public Service Commission, which has regulation authority, be given more power to penalize and fine poor-performing utility companies.

Rice supports the “Raise the Age NY” initiative to treat non-violent teen offenders as juveniles in the criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/advocates-to-state-don-t-prosecute-16-17-year-olds-as-adults-1.5923709|title=Advocates to state: Don't prosecute 16-, 17-year olds as adults|date=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

;Guns, gangs, and violent crime
Rice has aggressively implemented gun buy-back programs in some of the county’s most crime-plagued areas, which have removed more than 2,000 guns {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. She also spoke out in favor of Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]]’s gun control legislation,<ref>{{cite web|work=The Albany Times-Union|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/guns/top-law-enforcement-officials-file-in-support-of-safe-act/2124/|title=Top law enforcement officials file in support of SAFE Act|date=June 25, 2013}}</ref> and she created the office’s first ever gun prosecution unit.<ref>{{cite web|work=Kathleen Rice Campaign Website|url=http://www.kathleenrice.com/record/2012-08-a-new-approach-to-gangs--guns|title=A New Approach to Gangs & Guns}}</ref>
Rice announced in early 2011 a major prosecution of 9 gun dealers and gun store employees arrested by police in an undercover operation investigating alleged illegal assault weapons.<ref>http://abclocal.go.com/story?section=news/local/long_island&id=7965139</ref> This was the second arrest for Martin Tretola, one of the gunshop owners.  He was previously arrested on firearms related violations in 2007.  Subsequently, in 2012, a federal jury delivered a verdict rejecting the charges of Nassau County and District Attorney Rice for the 2007 arrest and awarded Tretola 3 million dollars in compensatory damages and 2 million dollars in punitive damages.<ref>http://www.theislandnow.com/williston_park/news/article_d76d95ee-ed56-11e1-92b0-001a4bcf887a.html</ref> This judgment was later reduced to 1.3 million dollars in total upon appeal.<ref>http://newsnyork.com/seaford-gun-shop-owner-gets-1-3m-judgment-from-nassau-in-wrongful-arrest-case/</ref>

In April 2013, Rice announced the arrest of 18 members of the “Rollin’ 60’s” gang, an “ultra-violent” subset of the Crips. Rice charged these defendants with crimes ranging from attempted murder of a police officer, to assault and robbery, to gun and drug sales.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/nassau-officials-ultra-violent-gang-members-arrested-1.5096256|title=Nassau officials: 'Ultra-violent' gang members arrested|date=April 18, 2013}}</ref>

Rice formed Nassau’s first-ever [[Medicaid]] and public assistance fraud unit, which has since secured millions of dollars in restitution for Nassau taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|work=Kathleen Rice Campaign Website|url=http://www.kathleenrice.com/record/2012-08-protecting-taxpayer-dollars|title=Protecting Taxpayer Dollars}}</ref>

;DA's Office gender pay gap and part-time employees
Rice has reformed the recruiting, hiring and promotional practices of her office. She eliminated a gender pay gap that had previously been greater than 30%. Rice developed an aimed at offering flex-and part-time work schedules to those needing to care for a family member or a personal situation. Half of the attorneys and management in Rice’s office are women.<ref>{{cite web|work=Kathleen Rice Campaign Website|url=http://www.kathleenrice.com/record/2012-08-promoting-equality-in-the-workplace|title=Promoting Equality in the Workplace}}</ref>

;Jesse Friedman case
In 2010, Rice ordered the review of a 1987 case in which Arnold Friedman and his son, Jesse, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing young boys in their Great Neck, Long Island home. Rice formed a panel of outside experts – including the [[Innocence Project]]’s [[Barry Scheck]] – to examine whether or not Jesse Friedman had wrongfully confessed. In a 172-page report released in July 2013, investigators found that Friedman had not been wrongfully convicted.<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jesse-friedman-100-guilty-child-abuse-article-1.1380786|title=Jesse Friedman is 100% guilty of sexually abusing children, reinvestigation by Nassau County district attorney concludes|date=June 25, 2013}}</ref>

==2010 Attorney General campaign==
In May 2010, Rice announced that she would seek the Democratic nomination for [[New York State Attorney General]]. The race pitted Rice against four Democratic opponents: then-State Senator [[Eric Schneiderman]], former prosecutor [[Sean Coffey]], former State Assemblyman [[Richard Brodsky]], and former insurance commissioner [[Eric Dinallo]]. Though originally considered a long shot, Rice would narrowly lose the five-way primary to Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 34% to 32%.<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/nyregion/15nyag.html|title=Schneiderman Wins Democratic Attorney General Race|date=September 15, 2010}}</ref>

===Tenure and issues===

;Drunken and drugged driving

In 2006, Rice, the "state's toughest DWI prosecutor,"<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/nassau-county-district-attorney-rice-joins-fight-leandra-law-article-1.414538|title=Nassau County District Attorney Rice joins fight for 'Leandra's Law'|date=November 14, 2009}}</ref> declared her first major policy initiative to be an “assault on the drunk driving epidemic.” She lowered the blood-alcohol level at which you could take a plea bargain,<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/14/nyregion/14drunk.html?pagewanted=print|title=A Harder Line on Driving While Drunk|date=March 14, 2006}}</ref> supported Leandra’s Law, and charged some drunk drivers who killed their victims with murder.<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/boroughs/new-da-town-hillary-swear-kathleen-rice-nassau-article-1.635672|title=A NEW DA IN TOWN Hillary to swear in Kathleen Rice in Nassau|date=January 8, 2006}}</ref>
 
;Reform efforts

In September 2011, Rice’s office arrested seven students after uncovering an [[SAT]] cheating ring on Long Island.<ref>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/sat-cheating-ring-busted-york-students-arrested/story?id=14617306|title=SAT Cheating Ring Busted, Seven Students Arrested|date=September 27, 2011}}</ref> When this case led to the discovery of a wider-spread cheating scandal, Rice worked with the [[College Board]], who administers the test, to update security standards to halt cheating in the future. This effort sparked other test administrators, like that which gives the ACT{{disambiguation needed|date=November 2013}}, to update their standards as well.<ref>{{cite web|work=ABC News|url=http://abcnews.go.com/News/BacktoSchool/sat-security-ny-cheating-ring/story?id=16012528|title=New SAT Security Changes After N.Y.

Rice has also received credit for teen education programs geared towards cyber bullying, drug use, sexting and dangerous driving.<ref>{{cite web|work=FiOs1|url=http://www.fios1news.com/longisland/longisland/node/38822?quicktabs_1=0#.UmmufhaChUR|title=Nassau County DA Attacks Cyber Crime|date=July 25, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Nassau County District Attorney|url=http://www.nassaucountyny.gov/agencies/da/heroineawareness.html|title=Heroin Prevention PSA}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|work=Anton News|url=http://www.antonnews.com/massapequanobserver/news/6347-dwi-education-program-at-local-schools.html|title=DWI Education Program at Local Schools|date=February 26, 2010}}</ref>

In 2007, Rice’s office, Nassau County and [[Hempstead (village)]] police led a counter-assault on Terrace Avenue, a major drug haven and crime-ridden street in [[Long Island]]’s Hempstead Village. Through a combination of zero-tolerance enforcement for repeat and violent offenders, and social-service based jail diversion for nonviolent and first time offenders, crime has been reduced in the area.<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/18/nyregion/long-island/18terraceli.html?_r=0|title=Street Known for Drug Crime Is Getting Clean|date=January 14, 2009}}</ref>

In 2008, following the trampling death of a [[Walmart]] employee at one of the retailer’s Black Friday sales events, Rice encouraged Walmart to upgrade its security protocols at its nearly 100 New York stores.<ref>{{cite web|work=USA Today|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/industries/retail/2009-05-06-walmart-death_N.htm|title=Wal-Mart pays $2M to avoid charges in death probe|date=May 6, 2009}}</ref>

In 2012, Rice came out in favor of decriminalizing small amounts of “plain view” marijuana.<ref>{{cite web|work=The Village Voice|url=http://blogs.villagevoice.com/runninscared/2012/06/cuomos_plan_to.php|title=Cuomo's Plan To Decriminalize Weed In "Public View" Has Support Of Pretty Much Everyone|date=June 4, 2012}}</ref> Rice has also supported efforts to allow some citizens to seal prior low-level, non-violent convictions in the hopes of improving their chances of obtaining employment.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.pfa-li.com/sealrecs.html|title=Debate over sealing records on old crimes|date=June 4, 2012}}</ref>

Rice was chosen by Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]] to be a member of the Moreland Commission on Utility Storm Preparation and Response, a panel tasked with investigating the failures of the [[Long Island Power Authority]] (LIPA) following Hurricane Sandy of October 2012. The panel recommended that LIPA be replaced by a private, investor-owned company and that the Public Service Commission, which has regulation authority, be given more power to penalize and fine poor-performing utility companies.

Rice supports the “Raise the Age NY” initiative to treat non-violent teen offenders as juveniles in the criminal justice system.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/advocates-to-state-don-t-prosecute-16-17-year-olds-as-adults-1.5923709|title=Advocates to state: Don't prosecute 16-, 17-year olds as adults|date=August 20, 2013}}</ref>

;Guns, gangs, and violent crime
Rice has aggressively implemented gun buy-back programs in some of the county’s most crime-plagued areas, which have removed more than 2,000 guns {{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. She also spoke out in favor of Governor [[Andrew Cuomo]]’s gun control legislation,<ref>{{cite web|work=The Albany Times-Union|url=http://blog.timesunion.com/guns/top-law-enforcement-officials-file-in-support-of-safe-act/2124/|title=Top law enforcement officials file in support of SAFE Act|date=June 25, 2013}}</ref> and she created the office’s first ever gun prosecution unit.<ref>{{cite web|work=Kathleen Rice Campaign Website|url=http://www.kathleenrice.com/record/2012-08-a-new-approach-to-gangs--guns|title=A New Approach to Gangs & Guns}}</ref>
Rice announced in early 2011 a major prosecution of 9 gun dealers and gun store employees arrested by police in an undercover operation investigating alleged illegal assault weapons.<ref>http://abclocal.go.com/story?section=news/local/long_island&id=7965139</ref> This was the second arrest for Martin Tretola, one of the gunshop owners.  He was previously arrested on firearms related violations in 2007.  Subsequently, in 2012, a federal jury delivered a verdict rejecting the charges of Nassau County and District Attorney Rice for the 2007 arrest and awarded Tretola 3 million dollars in compensatory damages and 2 million dollars in punitive damages.<ref>http://www.theislandnow.com/williston_park/news/article_d76d95ee-ed56-11e1-92b0-001a4bcf887a.html</ref> This judgment was later reduced to 1.3 million dollars in total upon appeal.<ref>http://newsnyork.com/seaford-gun-shop-owner-gets-1-3m-judgment-from-nassau-in-wrongful-arrest-case/</ref>

In April 2013, Rice announced the arrest of 18 members of the “Rollin’ 60’s” gang, an “ultra-violent” subset of the Crips. Rice charged these defendants with crimes ranging from attempted murder of a police officer, to assault and robbery, to gun and drug sales.<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/nassau-officials-ultra-violent-gang-members-arrested-1.5096256|title=Nassau officials: 'Ultra-violent' gang members arrested|date=April 18, 2013}}</ref>

In July 2013, Kathleen Rice was appointed by Governor Cuomo to be one of three co-chairs of the Moreland Commission on Public Corruption. The work of the commission is currently ongoing.<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/nyregion/cuomo-names-panel-to-investigate-corrupt-elected-officials.html?_r=0|title=Cuomo Creates Special Commission to Investigate Corrupt Elected Officials|date=July 2, 2013}}</ref>

Rice formed Nassau’s first-ever [[Medicaid]] and public assistance fraud unit, which has since secured millions of dollars in restitution for Nassau taxpayers.<ref>{{cite web|work=Kathleen Rice Campaign Website|url=http://www.kathleenrice.com/record/2012-08-protecting-taxpayer-dollars|title=Protecting Taxpayer Dollars}}</ref>

;DA's Office gender pay gap and part-time employees
Rice has reformed the recruiting, hiring and promotional practices of her office. She eliminated a gender pay gap that had previously been greater than 30%. Rice developed an aimed at offering flex-and part-time work schedules to those needing to care for a family member or a personal situation. Half of the attorneys and management in Rice’s office are women.<ref>{{cite web|work=Kathleen Rice Campaign Website|url=http://www.kathleenrice.com/record/2012-08-promoting-equality-in-the-workplace|title=Promoting Equality in the Workplace}}</ref>

;Jesse Friedman case
In 2010, Rice ordered the review of a 1987 case in which Arnold Friedman and his son, Jesse, pleaded guilty to sexually abusing young boys in their Great Neck, Long Island home. Rice formed a panel of outside experts – including the [[Innocence Project]]’s [[Barry Scheck]] – to examine whether or not Jesse Friedman had wrongfully confessed. In a 172-page report released in July 2013, investigators found that Friedman had not been wrongfully convicted.<ref>{{cite web|work=New York Daily News|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jesse-friedman-100-guilty-child-abuse-article-1.1380786|title=Jesse Friedman is 100% guilty of sexually abusing children, reinvestigation by Nassau County district attorney concludes|date=June 25, 2013}}</ref>

==2010 Attorney General campaign==
In May 2010, Rice announced that she would seek the Democratic nomination for [[New York State Attorney General]]. The race pitted Rice against four Democratic opponents: then-State Senator [[Eric Schneiderman]], former prosecutor [[Sean Coffey]], former State Assemblyman [[Richard Brodsky]], and former insurance commissioner [[Eric Dinallo]]. Though originally considered a long shot, Rice would narrowly lose the five-way primary to Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, 34% to 32%.<ref>{{cite web|work=The New York Times|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/15/nyregion/15nyag.html|title=Schneiderman Wins Democratic Attorney General Race|date=September 15, 2010}}</ref>

==President of DAASNY==
In July 2013, Rice was inducted as President of the [[District Attorneys Association of the State of New York]] (DAASNY).<ref>{{cite web|work=Newsday|url=http://www.newsday.com/long-island/nassau/kathleen-rice-to-lead-state-district-attorneys-1.5753929|title=Kathleen Rice to lead state district attorneys|date=July 23, 2013}}</ref>

===2005 election===
In 2005, Kathleen Rice returned home to Nassau County and declared her candidacy for [[District Attorney]] on the Democratic line. Rice challenged 30-year incumbent DA [[Denis Dillon]].
