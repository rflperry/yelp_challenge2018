'''Stephen Allen "Steve" Womack'''<ref>[http://www.legistorm.com/memberbio/2731/Rep_Steve_Womack_AR.html Representative Stephen Allen Womack (Steve) (R-Arkansas, 3rd) – Biography from]. LegiStorm. Retrieved on 2011-06-24.</ref> (born February 18, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|AR|3}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Prior to his election to Congress, Womack was Mayor of [[Rogers, Arkansas]].

== Early life, education, and business career ==

Womack was born in [[Russellville, Arkansas]], the son of Elisabeth F. (Canerday) and James Kermit Womack.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/womack.htm</ref> He spent most of his childhood in [[Moberly, Missouri]]; but moved back to Russellville at the age of 16 and graduated from [[Russellville High School (Arkansas)|Russellville High School]] in 1973.  He graduated from [[Arkansas Tech University]] in 1979.  Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the [[Arkansas Army National Guard]].  He served for 30 years, retiring in 2009 as a colonel.  Womack's father founded [[KURM (AM)|KURM-AM]] in 1979, and Womack served as station manager from 1979 to 1990.  He then served as executive officer of the Army [[ROTC]] program at the [[University of Arkansas]] from 1990 to 1996, then joined [[Merrill Lynch]] as a financial consultant.

== Mayor of Rogers ==
In 1998, Womack was elected mayor of [[Rogers, Arkansas|Rogers]], the ninth largest city of [[Arkansas]]. He ousted 17-year incumbent John Sampier Jr. A major issue in the city was [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]]. The organization [[Americans for an Immigration Moratorium]] attacked Sampier for being a pro-immigration liberal. Womack pledged to get tough on illegal immigrants saying "If you're coming to America illegally, you don't want to come to Rogers." The city had a growing Hispanic population, where it made 20% of the population, according to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]]. A year after the election, the [[National Council of La Raza]] awarded Sampier for his courage in helping out [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]].

In 1999, Womack had two agents of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] assigned to the Rogers Police Department. As a result, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF) filed a [[class-action suit]] against the city policeforce for racial profiling.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/2001/06/03/a-town-s-two-faces.html A Town's Two Faces]. Newsweek (2001-06-04). Retrieved on 2011-06-24.</ref>

In 2002 and 2006 Womack won re-election unopposed.<ref>[http://www.rogersarkansas.com/administration/bio.asp Bio at Rogers city site]. Rogersarkansas.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-24.</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2010#District 3}}

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican [[John Boozman]] gave it up to run for the [[United States Senate]]. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman.  He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624472</ref> In the June runoff, he defeated [[Arkansas Senate|State Senator]] and fellow Rogers resident [[Cecile Bledsoe]] 52%-48%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=648529</ref>

In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487764</ref>

Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid.  However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record.  As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2012/07/09/ken-aden-dropping-out-of-3rd-district-congressional-race  |title=Ken Aden dropping out of 3rd District congressional race|date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=August 15, 2012|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|first=Max|last=Brantley}}</ref> He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705043</ref>

'''Stephen Allen "Steve" Womack'''<ref>[http://www.legistorm.com/memberbio/2731/Rep_Steve_Womack_AR.html Representative Stephen Allen Womack (Steve) (R-Arkansas, 3rd) – Biography from]. LegiStorm. Retrieved on 2011-06-24.</ref> (born February 18, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|AR|3}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Prior to his election to Congress, Womack was Mayor of [[Rogers, Arkansas]].

== Early life, education, and business career ==

Womack was born in [[Russellville, Arkansas]], the son of Elisabeth F. (Canerday) and James Kermit Womack.<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/%7Ebattle/reps/womack.htm</ref> He spent most of his childhood in [[Moberly, Missouri]]; but moved back to Russellville at the age of 16 and graduated from [[Russellville High School (Arkansas)|Russellville High School]] in 1973.  He graduated from [[Arkansas Tech University]] in 1979.  Shortly afterward, he enlisted in the [[Arkansas Army National Guard]].  He served for 30 years, retiring in 2009 as a colonel.  Womack's father founded [[KURM (AM)|KURM-AM]] in 1979, and Womack served as station manager from 1979 to 1990.  He then served as executive officer of the Army [[ROTC]] program at the [[University of Arkansas]] from 1990 to 1996, then joined [[Merrill Lynch]] as a financial consultant.

== Mayor of Rogers ==
In 1998, Womack was elected mayor of [[Rogers, Arkansas|Rogers]], the ninth largest city of [[Arkansas]]. He ousted 17-year incumbent John Sampier Jr. A major issue in the city was [[Illegal immigration to the United States|illegal immigration]]. The organization [[Americans for an Immigration Moratorium]] attacked Sampier for being a pro-immigration liberal. Womack pledged to get tough on illegal immigrants saying "If you're coming to America illegally, you don't want to come to Rogers." The city had a growing Hispanic population, where it made 20% of the population, according to the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]]. A year after the election, the [[National Council of La Raza]] awarded Sampier for his courage in helping out [[Hispanic and Latino Americans|Hispanic Americans]].

In 1999, Womack had two agents of the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] assigned to the Rogers Police Department. As a result, the [[Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund]] (MALDEF) filed a [[class-action suit]] against the city policeforce for racial profiling.<ref>[http://www.newsweek.com/2001/06/03/a-town-s-two-faces.html A Town's Two Faces]. Newsweek (2001-06-04). Retrieved on 2011-06-24.</ref>

In 2002 and 2006 Womack won re-election unopposed.<ref>[http://www.rogersarkansas.com/administration/bio.asp Bio at Rogers city site]. Rogersarkansas.com. Retrieved on 2011-06-24.</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Arkansas, 2010#District 3}}

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican [[John Boozman]] gave it up to run for the [[United States Senate]]. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman.  He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=624472</ref> In the June runoff, he defeated [[Arkansas Senate|State Senator]] and fellow Rogers resident [[Cecile Bledsoe]] 52%-48%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=648529</ref>

In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487764</ref>

Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid.  However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record.  As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November.<ref>{{cite web|url= http://www.arktimes.com/ArkansasBlog/archives/2012/07/09/ken-aden-dropping-out-of-3rd-district-congressional-race  |title=Ken Aden dropping out of 3rd District congressional race|date=July 9, 2012|accessdate=August 15, 2012|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]]|first=Max|last=Brantley}}</ref> He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705043</ref>
