==Early life, education, and early career==
Rogers was born in [[Wayne County, Kentucky|Barrier, Kentucky]], attended [[Western Kentucky University]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] and received a baccalaureate degree (A.B.) and a [[law]] degree (LL.B.) from the [[University of Kentucky]] at [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. Rogers served in the Kentucky and [[North Carolina]] [[Army National Guard]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=A-5th Selects Rogers As Soldier of the Year |work=The Kentucky Guardsman |date=January 1961 |page=6 |format=PDF |url=http://kynghistory.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/6FC5400B-5907-483E-BAE2-E0D38772586E/0/kgjan61.pdf }}</ref>

As a lawyer Rogers was in private practice and was elected to serve as [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] for Pulaski and Rockcastle counties in Kentucky, an office he held from 1969 to his election to Congress in 1980.

Rogers was the Republican nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky]] in 1979. He was on the ballot with former [[Governor of Kentucky]] [[Louie B. Nunn]]. He lost to [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] nominee [[Martha Layne Collins]] 63%-37%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=364388 |title=KY Lt. Governor Race - Nov 06, 1979 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> The following year Rogers won election to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1980, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Tim Lee Carter]] of [[Kentucky's 5th congressional district]] decided to retire. Rogers won the Republican primary with a plurality of 23 percent. The losing candidates included the 1971 gubernatorial nominee, [[Tom Emberton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=371735 |title=KY District 5 - R Primary Race - May 27, 1980 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> He won the general election with 67% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=49548 |title=KY District 5 Race - Nov 04, 1980 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> He won re-election with at least 65 percent of the vote since then, except in 1992. That year, he defeated Democratic State Senator John Doug Hays 55-45 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27994 |title=KY District 5 Race - Nov 03, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Rogers is the longest serving Kentucky Republican ever elected to federal office.{{cn|date=December 2014}} Rogers served as a delegate to multiple [[Republican National Conventions]].

In 2001, the City of [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]] named their [[Kentucky Splash Waterpark|new water park]] and miniature golf facility the Hal Rogers Family Entertainment Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckysplash.com |title=Kentucky Splash Waterpark - Hal Rogers Entertainment Center |publisher=Kentuckysplash.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> as a "thank-you for all of the federal money he has brought back to Whitley County, the City of Williamsburg, and the other 40 counties he represents."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckysplash.com/index.php?page=parkhistory |title=Kentucky Splash Waterpark - Hal Rogers Entertainment Center |publisher=Kentuckysplash.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

On the House/Senate conference decision to bolster the Department of Commerce and support the Clinton Administration priorities, President Clinton remarked, “I commend the congressional leadership, Senator [[Ernest Hollings]], Senator [[Pete Domenici]], Congressman [[Neal Edward Smith|Neal Smith]], and Congressman Harold Rogers, for their foresight and support in revitalizing this country through these programs. It is a dramatic step forward for the United States toward a solid economic future.”<ref>{{cite web |author=Clinton, William J |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=47230 |title=Statement on Congressional Action on Department of Commerce Appropriations |date=October 19, 1993 |publisher=The American Presidency Project  }}</ref>

Similar praise comes from former President [[George H.W. Bush]], “I'm pleased to see these three distinguished Members of the Congress here. You may not remember this ancient history, but Hal Rogers was my Kentucky State chairman in my quest for the Presidency. And what a job that guy did, I'll tell you.”<ref>{{cite web |author=Bush, George H. W. |title=Remarks at a Fundraising Reception for Senator Mitch McConnell in Lexington, Kentucky |date=May 13, 1989 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17027 |publisher=The American Presidency Project }}</ref>

Kentucky state biographer Amy Witherbee commented on Rogers service, “Rogers' multiple roles on the Appropriations Committee have honed his skills as a bipartisan negotiator, and his economically challenged district often prompts him to stray from hard-line conservative stances. Although voting with his party against raising environmental standards on sports utility vehicles and against a controversial amendment that would have prohibited oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Rogers has been the creator and leading proponent of large environmental protection and clean-up programs throughout the Appalachian region.”<ref>{{cite news |last=Witherbee |first=Amy |title=Hal Rogers |publisher=Our States: Kentucky |year=2007 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1033509831.html;jsessionid=7FEDA5785E9B1E9DB2B2EBA42AC7914B }}</ref>

“In addition, Rogers' reluctance to involve the federal government in local issues has not deterred him from supporting a multitude of economic development programs aimed at creating new job bases in economically disadvantaged areas, and particularly in Appalachia. In 1993, Rogers was one of only three Republicans to vote for then-President [[Bill Clinton]]'s economic stimulus package. In March 2003, Rogers' ability to work through the bipartisan tangles of the Appropriations Committee won him the chairmanship on the subcommittee designated to control funding for the new Department of Homeland Security,” noted Witherbee.

Ready evidence is found on March 20, 2008, when the invitation to testify in support of environmental legislation by Democrat House Majority Leader Rep. Rocky Adkins,<ref>{{cite web |work=Pol Watchers |title=GOP Congressman backs House Dems' stream bill |date=March 20, 2008 |first=Ryan |last=Alessi |archivedate=March 25, 2008 |url=http://polwatchers.typepad.com/pol_watchers/2008/03/gop-congressman.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080325053003/http://polwatchers.typepad.com/pol_watchers/2008/03/gop-congressman.html }}</ref> and, on the same day, a rare invitation to speak from the Senate floor was afforded by Republican Senate Majority Leader Senator [[David L. Williams (politician)|David L. Williams]] of [[Cumberland County, Kentucky|Cumberland County]] as part of the Senate’s  unanimously passed bipartisan resolution honoring Rogers for his service.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Senate honors Congressman Rogers |work=KYPolitics.org |date=March 20, 2008 |url=http://www.kypolitics.org/kypolitics/hal_rogers/index.html |archivedate=May 8, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080508020342/http://www.kypolitics.org/kypolitics/hal_rogers/index.html }}</ref>

Rogers called a bill to reduce funding for law enforcement "the result of this new Republican majority’s commitment to bring about real change in the way Washington spends the people’s money."<ref>Faler, Brian. [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-12/republicans-democrats-reach-agreement-on-38-billion-of-u-s-budget-cuts.html "Law Enforcement, Environment Funds Cut in Budget Deal."] ''Bloomberg'', 12 April 2011.</ref>

In 2011, Rogers voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Rogers has been widely criticized by both liberal and conservative pundits for his priorities when it comes to national security. ''[[National Review]]'' referred to Rogers as "a national disgrace"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/17/opinion/main1624835.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Hal Rogers: A Congressional Disgrace | date=May 17, 2006}}</ref> and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named him one of America's "Ten Worst Congressmen", calling him "Bin Laden's Best Friend" due to the fact that Rogers steered federal homeland security money away from large cities to his home district, which critics claim is one of the least likely terrorist targets in America because of its lack of any notable monuments or population centers.<ref>{{cite web |first=Time |last=Dickinson |title=The 10 Worst Congressmen |work=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/12054520/the_10_worst_congressmen/9 | date=October 17, 2006 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503084434/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/12054520/the_10_worst_congressmen/9 | archivedate=May 3, 2008 }}</ref>  In 2007, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] named Congressman Rogers to its list of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ronica Shannon |url=http://richmondregister.com/localnews/x155232819/McConnell-Rogers-on-Most-Corrupt-list |title=McConnell, Rogers on ‘Most Corrupt’ list » Local News |publisher=The Richmond Register |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>

On May 14, 2006, the [[New York Times]] reported that Rogers had used his legislative position as chairman of the House subcommittee that controls the Homeland Security budget to create "jobs in his home district and profits for companies that are donors to his political causes."<ref>{{cite news |title=In Kentucky Hills, a Homeland Security Bonanza |work=The New York Times |first=Eric |last=Lipton |date=May 14, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/washington/14rogers.html }}</ref>
The Lexington Herald-Leader in 2005 called Rogers the "Prince of Pork".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cheves |first=John |title=Prince of Pork: Hal Rogers Hauls Home Tax Dollars By The Billions |work=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=February 6, 2005 }}</ref> The ''Times'' article reported that Rogers had inserted language ("existing government card issuance centers") into appropriations bills that effectively pushed the federal government into testing at a cost of $4 million older, inappropriate technology for a new fraud-resistant [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] for permanent legal immigrants, at a production plant in [[Corbin, Kentucky]], within Rogers' district. The study concluded that the smart card approach was far superior. The ''Times'' found that about $100,000 in contributions had come to Mr. Rogers from parties with at least some ties to the identification card effort.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Lipton |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/washington/14rogers.html?ex=1305259200&en=dad1e84a10163acc&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=In Kentucky Hills, a Homeland Security Bonanza |work=The New York Times |date=May 14, 2006 }}</ref>

In response to these critics, Rogers has stated, “It should surprise no one that this article from Rolling Stone regarding my activity in connection with the Transportation Worker Identity Card (TWIC) is grossly incorrect, and highly slanderous,” the congressman said. “A true and honest analysis would reveal that my sole interest in TWIC is simply to protect America's seaports, airports, and other transportation facilities from terrorist penetration.  To purport that my actions have compromised national security in an effort to bring jobs to Kentucky or for personal gain is an absolute lie.”<ref>{{cite news |last=Neal |first=Jeff |title=Rogers: Is he one of nation’s 10 worst congressmen? |work=Commonwealth Journal |date=November 1, 2006 }}</ref>

After Iran objected to the interim deployment of an [[Afloat Forward Staging Base]] to counter their threats to close the Persian Gulf, Rogers cut the funding for the project.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/middleeast/the-navy-ship-ponce-reflects-the-new-united-states-way-of-war.html "Floating Base Gives U.S. New Footing in the Persian Gulf."]</ref><ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20121209/DEFREG02/312090001/Funding-Spat-Could-Sink-USN-Virginia-Class-Sub "Funding Spat Could Sink USN Virginia-Class Sub."]</ref>

===MilCon/VA Bill===

On June 12, 2013, the [[White House]] threatened to [[veto]] the [[Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013|MilCon/VA spending bill]], because Republicans did not agree with the Senate's number of $1.058 trillions intended for military operations and research, after the MilCon/VA bill received 421 [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] votes in House. "We’re marking up to $967 billion, the top line under current law", said Rogers, who currently serves as the chairman of [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_6-12-13.htm |title=Rogers: Make my day |date=June 13, 2013 |publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, Roger's committee called for cuts in the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] budget that cast doubt on the US Navy's ability to provide a [[Ohio Replacement Submarine]] class.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/07/09/navy-leaders-dept-energy-budget-cuts-threaten-navys-nuclear-fleet |title=Navy Leaders: Dept. of Energy Budget Cuts Threaten Navy’s Nuclear Fleet |last1=LaGrone |first1=Sam |date=9 July 2014 |website=news.usni.org |publisher=U.S. NAVAL INSTITUTE  |accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>

'''Harold Dallas "Hal" Rogers''' (born December 31, 1937) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|KY|5}}, serving since 1981. He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
Rogers was born in [[Wayne County, Kentucky|Barrier, Kentucky]], attended [[Western Kentucky University]] in [[Bowling Green, Kentucky|Bowling Green]] and received a baccalaureate degree (A.B.) and a [[law]] degree (LL.B.) from the [[University of Kentucky]] at [[Lexington, Kentucky|Lexington]]. Rogers served in the Kentucky and [[North Carolina]] [[Army National Guard]]."<ref>{{cite news |title=A-5th Selects Rogers As Soldier of the Year |work=The Kentucky Guardsman |date=January 1961 |page=6 |format=PDF |url=http://kynghistory.ky.gov/NR/rdonlyres/6FC5400B-5907-483E-BAE2-E0D38772586E/0/kgjan61.pdf }}</ref>

As a lawyer Rogers was in private practice and was elected to serve as [[Commonwealth's Attorney]] for Pulaski and Rockcastle counties in Kentucky, an office he held from 1969 to his election to Congress in 1980.

Rogers was the Republican nominee for [[Lieutenant Governor of Kentucky]] in 1979. He was on the ballot with former [[Governor of Kentucky]] [[Louie B. Nunn]]. He lost to [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] nominee [[Martha Layne Collins]] 63%-37%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=364388 |title=KY Lt. Governor Race - Nov 06, 1979 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> The following year Rogers won election to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1980, incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Tim Lee Carter]] of [[Kentucky's 5th congressional district]] decided to retire. Rogers won the Republican primary with a plurality of 23 percent. The losing candidates included the 1971 gubernatorial nominee, [[Tom Emberton]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=371735 |title=KY District 5 - R Primary Race - May 27, 1980 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> He won the general election with 67% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=49548 |title=KY District 5 Race - Nov 04, 1980 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref> He won re-election with at least 65 percent of the vote since then, except in 1992. That year, he defeated Democratic State Senator John Doug Hays 55-45 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27994 |title=KY District 5 Race - Nov 03, 1992 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Rogers is the longest serving Kentucky Republican ever elected to federal office.{{cn|date=December 2014}} Rogers served as a delegate to multiple [[Republican National Conventions]].

In 2001, the City of [[Williamsburg, Kentucky]] named their [[Kentucky Splash Waterpark|new water park]] and miniature golf facility the Hal Rogers Family Entertainment Center<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckysplash.com |title=Kentucky Splash Waterpark - Hal Rogers Entertainment Center |publisher=Kentuckysplash.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> as a "thank-you for all of the federal money he has brought back to Whitley County, the City of Williamsburg, and the other 40 counties he represents."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kentuckysplash.com/index.php?page=parkhistory |title=Kentucky Splash Waterpark - Hal Rogers Entertainment Center |publisher=Kentuckysplash.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

On the House/Senate conference decision to bolster the Department of Commerce and support the Clinton Administration priorities, President Clinton remarked, “I commend the congressional leadership, Senator [[Ernest Hollings]], Senator [[Pete Domenici]], Congressman [[Neal Edward Smith|Neal Smith]], and Congressman Harold Rogers, for their foresight and support in revitalizing this country through these programs. It is a dramatic step forward for the United States toward a solid economic future.”<ref>{{cite web |author=Clinton, William J |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=47230 |title=Statement on Congressional Action on Department of Commerce Appropriations |date=October 19, 1993 |publisher=The American Presidency Project  }}</ref>

Similar praise comes from former President [[George H.W. Bush]], “I'm pleased to see these three distinguished Members of the Congress here. You may not remember this ancient history, but Hal Rogers was my Kentucky State chairman in my quest for the Presidency. And what a job that guy did, I'll tell you.”<ref>{{cite web |author=Bush, George H. W. |title=Remarks at a Fundraising Reception for Senator Mitch McConnell in Lexington, Kentucky |date=May 13, 1989 |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/index.php?pid=17027 |publisher=The American Presidency Project }}</ref>

Kentucky state biographer Amy Witherbee commented on Rogers service, “Rogers' multiple roles on the Appropriations Committee have honed his skills as a bipartisan negotiator, and his economically challenged district often prompts him to stray from hard-line conservative stances. Although voting with his party against raising environmental standards on sports utility vehicles and against a controversial amendment that would have prohibited oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Rogers has been the creator and leading proponent of large environmental protection and clean-up programs throughout the Appalachian region.”<ref>{{cite news |last=Witherbee |first=Amy |title=Hal Rogers |publisher=Our States: Kentucky |year=2007 |url= http://connection.ebscohost.com/content/article/1033509831.html;jsessionid=7FEDA5785E9B1E9DB2B2EBA42AC7914B }}</ref>

“In addition, Rogers' reluctance to involve the federal government in local issues has not deterred him from supporting a multitude of economic development programs aimed at creating new job bases in economically disadvantaged areas, and particularly in Appalachia. In 1993, Rogers was one of only three Republicans to vote for then-President [[Bill Clinton]]'s economic stimulus package. In March 2003, Rogers' ability to work through the bipartisan tangles of the Appropriations Committee won him the chairmanship on the subcommittee designated to control funding for the new Department of Homeland Security,” noted Witherbee.

Ready evidence is found on March 20, 2008, when the invitation to testify in support of environmental legislation by Democrat House Majority Leader Rep. Rocky Adkins,<ref>{{cite web |work=Pol Watchers |title=GOP Congressman backs House Dems' stream bill |date=March 20, 2008 |first=Ryan |last=Alessi |archivedate=March 25, 2008 |url=http://polwatchers.typepad.com/pol_watchers/2008/03/gop-congressman.html |archiveurl= http://web.archive.org/web/20080325053003/http://polwatchers.typepad.com/pol_watchers/2008/03/gop-congressman.html }}</ref> and, on the same day, a rare invitation to speak from the Senate floor was afforded by Republican Senate Majority Leader Senator [[David L. Williams (politician)|David L. Williams]] of [[Cumberland County, Kentucky|Cumberland County]] as part of the Senate’s  unanimously passed bipartisan resolution honoring Rogers for his service.<ref>{{cite web |title=Kentucky Senate honors Congressman Rogers |work=KYPolitics.org |date=March 20, 2008 |url=http://www.kypolitics.org/kypolitics/hal_rogers/index.html |archivedate=May 8, 2008 |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080508020342/http://www.kypolitics.org/kypolitics/hal_rogers/index.html }}</ref>

Rogers called a bill to reduce funding for law enforcement "the result of this new Republican majority’s commitment to bring about real change in the way Washington spends the people’s money."<ref>Faler, Brian. [http://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-04-12/republicans-democrats-reach-agreement-on-38-billion-of-u-s-budget-cuts.html "Law Enforcement, Environment Funds Cut in Budget Deal."] ''Bloomberg'', 12 April 2011.</ref>

In 2011, Rogers voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

===Criticism===
Rogers has been widely criticized by both liberal and conservative pundits for his priorities when it comes to national security. ''[[National Review]]'' referred to Rogers as "a national disgrace"<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2006/05/17/opinion/main1624835.shtml | work=CBS News | title=Hal Rogers: A Congressional Disgrace | date=May 17, 2006}}</ref> and ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' named him one of America's "Ten Worst Congressmen", calling him "Bin Laden's Best Friend" due to the fact that Rogers steered federal homeland security money away from large cities to his home district, which critics claim is one of the least likely terrorist targets in America because of its lack of any notable monuments or population centers.<ref>{{cite web |first=Time |last=Dickinson |title=The 10 Worst Congressmen |work=Rolling Stone |url=http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/12054520/the_10_worst_congressmen/9 | date=October 17, 2006 | archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20080503084434/http://www.rollingstone.com/politics/story/12054520/the_10_worst_congressmen/9 | archivedate=May 3, 2008 }}</ref>  In 2007, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] named Congressman Rogers to its list of the Most Corrupt Members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|author=Ronica Shannon |url=http://richmondregister.com/localnews/x155232819/McConnell-Rogers-on-Most-Corrupt-list |title=McConnell, Rogers on ‘Most Corrupt’ list » Local News |publisher=The Richmond Register |date= |accessdate=2012-03-08}}</ref>

On May 14, 2006, the [[New York Times]] reported that Rogers had used his legislative position as chairman of the House subcommittee that controls the Homeland Security budget to create "jobs in his home district and profits for companies that are donors to his political causes."<ref>{{cite news |title=In Kentucky Hills, a Homeland Security Bonanza |work=The New York Times |first=Eric |last=Lipton |date=May 14, 2006 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/washington/14rogers.html }}</ref>
The Lexington Herald-Leader in 2005 called Rogers the "Prince of Pork".<ref>{{cite news |last=Cheves |first=John |title=Prince of Pork: Hal Rogers Hauls Home Tax Dollars By The Billions |work=Lexington Herald-Leader |date=February 6, 2005 }}</ref> The ''Times'' article reported that Rogers had inserted language ("existing government card issuance centers") into appropriations bills that effectively pushed the federal government into testing at a cost of $4 million older, inappropriate technology for a new fraud-resistant [[Permanent residence (United States)|green card]] for permanent legal immigrants, at a production plant in [[Corbin, Kentucky]], within Rogers' district. The study concluded that the smart card approach was far superior. The ''Times'' found that about $100,000 in contributions had come to Mr. Rogers from parties with at least some ties to the identification card effort.<ref>{{cite news |first=Eric |last=Lipton |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/14/washington/14rogers.html?ex=1305259200&en=dad1e84a10163acc&ei=5090&partner=rssuserland&emc=rss |title=In Kentucky Hills, a Homeland Security Bonanza |work=The New York Times |date=May 14, 2006 }}</ref>

In response to these critics, Rogers has stated, “It should surprise no one that this article from Rolling Stone regarding my activity in connection with the Transportation Worker Identity Card (TWIC) is grossly incorrect, and highly slanderous,” the congressman said. “A true and honest analysis would reveal that my sole interest in TWIC is simply to protect America's seaports, airports, and other transportation facilities from terrorist penetration.  To purport that my actions have compromised national security in an effort to bring jobs to Kentucky or for personal gain is an absolute lie.”<ref>{{cite news |last=Neal |first=Jeff |title=Rogers: Is he one of nation’s 10 worst congressmen? |work=Commonwealth Journal |date=November 1, 2006 }}</ref>

After Iran objected to the interim deployment of an [[Afloat Forward Staging Base]] to counter their threats to close the Persian Gulf, Rogers cut the funding for the project.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/07/12/world/middleeast/the-navy-ship-ponce-reflects-the-new-united-states-way-of-war.html "Floating Base Gives U.S. New Footing in the Persian Gulf."]</ref><ref>[http://www.defensenews.com/article/20121209/DEFREG02/312090001/Funding-Spat-Could-Sink-USN-Virginia-Class-Sub "Funding Spat Could Sink USN Virginia-Class Sub."]</ref>

===MilCon/VA Bill===

On June 12, 2013, the [[White House]] threatened to [[veto]] the [[Consolidated and Further Continuing Appropriations Act, 2013|MilCon/VA spending bill]], because Republicans did not agree with the Senate's number of $1.058 trillions intended for military operations and research, after the MilCon/VA bill received 421 [[Bipartisanship|bipartisan]] votes in House. "We’re marking up to $967 billion, the top line under current law", said Rogers, who currently serves as the chairman of [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_6-12-13.htm |title=Rogers: Make my day |date=June 13, 2013 |publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=15 June 2013}}</ref>

In 2014, Roger's committee called for cuts in the [[National Nuclear Security Administration]] budget that cast doubt on the US Navy's ability to provide a [[Ohio Replacement Submarine]] class.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.usni.org/2014/07/09/navy-leaders-dept-energy-budget-cuts-threaten-navys-nuclear-fleet |title=Navy Leaders: Dept. of Energy Budget Cuts Threaten Navy’s Nuclear Fleet |last1=LaGrone |first1=Sam |date=9 July 2014 |website=news.usni.org |publisher=U.S. NAVAL INSTITUTE  |accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>
