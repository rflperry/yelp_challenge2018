of the Quran.

“America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model 
that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students", Carson said.

===Energy and environment===
Carson has supported investment in the development of new technologies that will reduce American dependence on foreign oil, create thousands of new jobs and begin to correct the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuels.

===Education===
Carson has stated his support for programs that improve teacher education and training, improve aging school infrastructure and increase access to affordable, secondary education.<ref name="Education Page">{{cite web|url=http://carson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=72&Itemid=77 |title=Congressman André Carson: Education |publisher=Carson.house.gov |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

schools should be modeled after Madrassas, the Islamic schools that are built on the foundations 
of the Quran.

“America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model 
that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students", Carson said.

===Energy and environment===
Carson has supported investment in the development of new technologies that will reduce American dependence on foreign oil, create thousands of new jobs and begin to correct the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuels.  Carson has opposed legislation to increase offshore drilling for oil or natural gas, instead promoting use of solar, wind, biofuel, biomass, and other renewable fuels.<ref name="Energy Page">{{cite web|url=http://carson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=73&Itemid=78 |title=Congressman André Carson: Energy |publisher=Carson.house.gov |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

He has opposed taxes both on the medical device industry and employer provided health insurance plans as a means to pay for health care reform.  Instead, he has called for finding savings in the current health system by reducing waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, as well as implementing a surcharge on the wealthiest Americans as a means to cover the costs of reform.  He has also voiced his opposition for health care reform legislation that increases the deficit.<ref name="Health Care Forum">{{cite web|url=http://carson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360:online-health-care-forum&catid=39:issues&Itemid=92 |title=Congressman André Carson: Online Health Care Forum |publisher=Carson.house.gov |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

schools should be modeled after Madrassas, the Islamic schools that are built on the foundations 
of the Quran.

“America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model 
that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students", Carson said.

===Energy and environment===
Carson has supported investment in the development of new technologies that will reduce American dependence on foreign oil, create thousands of new jobs and begin to correct the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuels.

He has opposed taxes both on the medical device industry and employer provided health insurance plans as a means to pay for health care reform.  Instead, he has called for finding savings in the current health system by reducing waste, fraud and abuse in the Medicare system, as well as implementing a surcharge on the wealthiest Americans as a means to cover the costs of reform.  He has also voiced his opposition for health care reform legislation that increases the deficit.<ref name="Health Care Forum">{{cite web|url=http://carson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=360:online-health-care-forum&catid=39:issues&Itemid=92 |title=Congressman André Carson: Online Health Care Forum |publisher=Carson.house.gov |date= |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>

schools should be modeled after Madrassas, the Islamic schools that are built on the foundations 
of the Quran.

“America will never tap into educational innovation and ingenuity without looking at the model 
that we have in our madrassas, in our schools, where innovation is encouraged, where the foundation is the Quran. And that model that we are pushing in some of our schools meets the multiple needs of students", Carson said.

===Energy and environment===
Carson has supported investment in the development of new technologies that will reduce American dependence on foreign oil, create thousands of new jobs and begin to correct the adverse environmental effects of fossil fuels.

In 2009, Carson introduced two pieces of legislation aimed at reducing incidents of [[recidivism]].  The Recidivism Reduction Act ({{USBill|111|HR|2829}}) aims to attack the cycle of recidivism by ensuring prompt access to federal supplemental security income and Medicaid benefits for ex-offenders reentering society and addressing the gap in mental health services.  The [[Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act]] repeals federal laws that prevent drug felons from receiving TANF benefits.<ref name="Recidivism Release">{{cite web|url=http://carson.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=315&Itemid=92 |title=Congressman André Carson: Keeping Communities Safe Means Stopping the Revolving Door of Prison |publisher=Carson.house.gov |date=June 12, 2009 |accessdate=December 6, 2011}}</ref>
