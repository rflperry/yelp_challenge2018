===Measure to care for pets in emergencies===
Titus authored the bill that provides for the rescue of pets in a natural disaster emergency. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators [[Randolph Townsend]] and [[Valerie Wiener]]. Titus told Las Vegas television station Channel 3 KVBC: ''"We all remember heartbreaking scenes and stories from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida ...  When lives are turned upside down by disaster, people seek comfort and normalcy. To exacerbate problems by forcing a disaster victim to leave behind a beloved pet - a member of their family - is both unconscionable and entirely unnecessary. Emergency responders can and should take into account pets and service animals in disaster rescue and recovery plans. Planning could save disaster victims from needless additional pain at a most difficult time."''<ref>[http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6144412 Dina Titus introduces measure to care for pets.]</ref> The bill was signed into law in June 2007.

==Political campaigns==
[[Image:Dina Titus at 2008 NV Dem State Convention.JPG|thumb|Titus at the 2008 Nevada Democratic State Convention]]

===2006===
{{See also|Nevada gubernatorial election, 2006}}
Incumbent [[Governor of Nevada|Governor]] [[Kenny Guinn]] could not run in 2006 due to [[term limits]]. Titus won the Democratic nomination, but lost to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].  While Titus won Clark County, her margin there was not enough to overcome a landslide margin in Gibbons' 2nd District.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada, 2008#District 3}}
Democrats were heavily targeting [[Nevada's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]] Republican incumbent [[Jon Porter]]. Their top candidate was [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] prosecutor Robert Daskas, but in April, Daskas dropped out for family reasons. Democrats then quickly recruited Titus, who had won the district in her unsuccessful 2006 run for Governor. Titus defeated Porter in November, 47% to 42%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the District. She was a major beneficiary of the over-all anti-Bush sentiment in the Las Vegas area. She was elected Regional Whip in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Usufzy|first=Pashtana|title=Titus appointed regional whip|url=http://unlvrebelyell.com/2008/12/01/titus-appointed-regional-whip|accessdate=October 8, 2011|newspaper=Rebel Yell|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref>

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada, 2010#District 3}}
Titus was defeated by Republican former State Senator [[Joe Heck]] by a margin of 2000 votes.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada, 2012#District 1}}
On October 31, 2011; Titus entered the Democratic primary for {{ushr|Nevada|1}}, where her home had been drawn in redistricting. The incumbent, fellow Democrat [[Shelley Berkley]], gave up the seat to run for the [[United States Senate]]. While the 3rd is considered a swing district, the 1st is far and away the safest Democratic seat in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/titus-to-announce-run-for-1st-district-seat-132958858.html|title=Titus to announce new bid for Congress|date=October 31, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|first=Laura|last=Myers}}</ref> She initially faced a challenge from State Senator [[Ruben Kihuen]] in the Democratic primary. Kihuen dropped out in February 2012, reportedly due to Titus leading him in polls and fundraising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashpolitics.reviewjournal.com/2012/02/07/kihuen-out-in-1st-congressional-district/|title=Kihuen out in 1st Congressional District|date=February 7, 2012}}</ref>  This all but assured Titus' return to Congress after a two-year absence.  She easily defeated her Republican challenger, Chris Edwards.

==Personal life==
Titus has been married to Prof. Thomas C. Wright for 30 years. Wright's studies in his field of expertise, [[Latin American history]], has taken the couple on extended journeys throughout Central and South American and to Spain. He is a retired professor of history at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]].<ref name=goldberg>{{cite news|last=Goldberg|first=Delen|title=Dina Titus retires from UNLV with $162,000 buyout|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/news/2011/jun/23/dina-titus-retires-unlv-162000-buyout/|accessdate=October 8, 2011|newspaper=Las Vegas Sun|date=June 23, 2011}}</ref>

'''Alice Costandina "Dina" Titus''' (born May 23, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for {{ushr|NV|1}} since 2013. She previously served as U.S. Representative for {{ushr|NV|3}} from 2009 to 2011, when she was defeated by [[Joe Heck]]. In 2012, she ran successfully for {{ushr|NV|1}}. Titus is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. She previously served in the [[Nevada Senate]] and was that body's [[minority leader]] from 1993 to 2009. Prior to her election to Congress, Titus was an active professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV). She taught American and Nevada government at UNLV for 30 years.

==Early life and education==
Titus was born in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] to parents of Greek descent and raised as Greek Orthodox. She grew up in [[Tifton, Georgia|Tifton]]. Her first exposure to politics came at an early age, when her father, Joe Titus, ran for the Tifton City Council. Her uncle, Theo Titus, served in the Georgia House of Representatives for many years.<ref name=about>{{cite web|title=About Dina Titus|url=http://www.dinatitus.com/about-dina-titus|work=Elect Dina Titus for U.S. Congress|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> She attended a summer program at [[The College of William & Mary]] and was admitted full-time for the fall - without a high school diploma. There, she studied political science. After earning her bachelor's degree from William and Mary, Titus went on to earn a master's degree from the [[University of Georgia]] and a Ph.D. from [[Florida State University]].<ref name=about/>

==Academic career==
After a year teaching at [[North Texas State University]], Titus moved to Nevada and a faculty position in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).  Over the past 30 years, her students have included a virtual who's-who list in Nevada government, public service and legal circles, and the popularity of her classes is reflected in the teaching-related awards she has received.<ref name=about/> She created and continues to coordinate the Legislative Internship Program at UNLV, which each session affords the opportunity for a group of students to work at the Legislature.

==Nevada Senate==
First elected in 1988, Titus served for 20 years in the [[Nevada Senate]], representing the Clark 7th District. Her major achievements from the 2007 session included:

===Access to vaccines===
Titus authored a bill that requires health insurance companies to cover the costs of the HPV vaccine, [[Gardasil]].  Gardasil protects women and girls from 70% of cervical cancers.  The bill passed both the Nevada Senate and the Nevada Assembly and was signed by Governor [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].

===Regulation of credit card rates===
Titus authored a bill banning "[[Schumer box|universal default clauses]]" that have enabled some credit card issuers to boost interest rates by 30 percent or more. The bill passed the Nevada Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].  Credit Card providers Citibank and Chase rolled back or eliminated universal default clauses due to political pressure in the U.S. Congress.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fehd|first=Amanda|title=Bill targeting high credit card rates goes to governor|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20070517/ELECTIONS/105170095|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=Nevada Appeal|date=17 May 2007}}</ref>

===Measure to care for pets in emergencies===
Titus authored the bill that provides for the rescue of pets in a natural disaster emergency. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators [[Randolph Townsend]] and [[Valerie Wiener]]. Titus told Las Vegas television station Channel 3 KVBC: ''"We all remember heartbreaking scenes and stories from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida ...  When lives are turned upside down by disaster, people seek comfort and normalcy. To exacerbate problems by forcing a disaster victim to leave behind a beloved pet - a member of their family - is both unconscionable and entirely unnecessary. Emergency responders can and should take into account pets and service animals in disaster rescue and recovery plans. Planning could save disaster victims from needless additional pain at a most difficult time."''<ref>[http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6144412 Dina Titus introduces measure to care for pets.]</ref> The bill was signed into law in June 2007.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

'''Alice Costandina "Dina" Titus''' (born May 23, 1950) is an [[United States|American]] politician who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|United States Representative]] for {{ushr|NV|1}} since 2013. She previously served as U.S. Representative for {{ushr|NV|3}} from 2009 to 2011, when she was defeated by [[Joe Heck]]. In 2012, she ran successfully for {{ushr|NV|1}}. Titus is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. She previously served in the [[Nevada Senate]] and was that body's [[minority leader]] from 1993 to 2009. Prior to her election to Congress, Titus was an active professor of [[political science]] at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV). She taught American and Nevada government at UNLV for 30 years.

==Early life and education==
Titus was born in [[Thomasville, Georgia]] to parents of Greek descent and raised as Greek Orthodox. She grew up in [[Tifton, Georgia|Tifton]]. Her first exposure to politics came at an early age, when her father, Joe Titus, ran for the Tifton City Council. Her uncle, Theo Titus, served in the Georgia House of Representatives for many years.<ref name=about>{{cite web|title=About Dina Titus|url=http://www.dinatitus.com/about-dina-titus|work=Elect Dina Titus for U.S. Congress|accessdate=October 8, 2011}}</ref> She attended a summer program at [[The College of William & Mary]] and was admitted full-time for the fall - without a high school diploma. There, she studied political science. After earning her bachelor's degree from William and Mary, Titus went on to earn a master's degree from the [[University of Georgia]] and a Ph.D. from [[Florida State University]].<ref name=about/>

==Academic career==
After a year teaching at [[North Texas State University]], Titus moved to Nevada and a faculty position in the Political Science Department at the [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas]] (UNLV).  Over the past 30 years, her students have included a virtual who's-who list in Nevada government, public service and legal circles, and the popularity of her classes is reflected in the teaching-related awards she has received.<ref name=about/> She created and continues to coordinate the Legislative Internship Program at UNLV, which each session affords the opportunity for a group of students to work at the Legislature.

==Nevada Senate==
First elected in 1988, Titus served for 20 years in the [[Nevada Senate]], representing the Clark 7th District. Her major achievements from the 2007 session included:

===Access to vaccines===
Titus authored a bill that requires health insurance companies to cover the costs of the HPV vaccine, [[Gardasil]].  Gardasil protects women and girls from 70% of cervical cancers.  The bill passed both the Nevada Senate and the Nevada Assembly and was signed by Governor [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].

===Regulation of credit card rates===
Titus authored a bill banning "[[Schumer box|universal default clauses]]" that have enabled some credit card issuers to boost interest rates by 30 percent or more. The bill passed the Nevada Senate and Assembly, but was vetoed by [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].  Credit Card providers Citibank and Chase rolled back or eliminated universal default clauses due to political pressure in the U.S. Congress.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fehd|first=Amanda|title=Bill targeting high credit card rates goes to governor|url=http://www.nevadaappeal.com/article/20070517/ELECTIONS/105170095|accessdate=11 October 2011|newspaper=Nevada Appeal|date=17 May 2007}}</ref>

===Measure to care for pets in emergencies===
Titus authored the bill that provides for the rescue of pets in a natural disaster emergency. The bill was co-sponsored by Senators [[Randolph Townsend]] and [[Valerie Wiener]]. Titus told Las Vegas television station Channel 3 KVBC: ''"We all remember heartbreaking scenes and stories from Louisiana, Mississippi and Florida ...  When lives are turned upside down by disaster, people seek comfort and normalcy. To exacerbate problems by forcing a disaster victim to leave behind a beloved pet - a member of their family - is both unconscionable and entirely unnecessary. Emergency responders can and should take into account pets and service animals in disaster rescue and recovery plans. Planning could save disaster victims from needless additional pain at a most difficult time."''<ref>[http://www.kvbc.com/Global/story.asp?S=6144412 Dina Titus introduces measure to care for pets.]</ref> The bill was signed into law in June 2007.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2006===
{{See also|Nevada gubernatorial election, 2006}}
Incumbent [[Governor of Nevada|Governor]] [[Kenny Guinn]] could not run in 2006 due to [[term limits]]. Titus won the Democratic nomination, but lost to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Congressman [[Jim Gibbons (U.S. politician)|Jim Gibbons]].  While Titus won Clark County, her margin there was not enough to overcome a landslide margin in Gibbons' 2nd District.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada, 2008#District 3}}
Democrats were heavily targeting [[Nevada's 3rd congressional district|3rd district]] Republican incumbent [[Jon Porter]]. Their top candidate was [[Clark County, Nevada|Clark County]] prosecutor Robert Daskas, but in April, Daskas dropped out for family reasons. Democrats then quickly recruited Titus, who had won the district in her unsuccessful 2006 run for Governor. Titus defeated Porter in November, 47% to 42%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the District. She was a major beneficiary of the over-all anti-Bush sentiment in the Las Vegas area. She was elected Regional Whip in the [[111th United States Congress|111th Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Usufzy|first=Pashtana|title=Titus appointed regional whip|url=http://unlvrebelyell.com/2008/12/01/titus-appointed-regional-whip|accessdate=October 8, 2011|newspaper=Rebel Yell|date=December 1, 2008}}</ref>

Titus was defeated by Republican former State Senator [[Joe Heck]] by a margin of 2000 votes.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Nevada, 2012#District 1}}
On October 31, 2011; Titus entered the Democratic primary for {{ushr|Nevada|1}}, where her home had been drawn in redistricting. The incumbent, fellow Democrat [[Shelley Berkley]], gave up the seat to run for the [[United States Senate]]. While the 3rd is considered a swing district, the 1st is far and away the safest Democratic seat in Nevada.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lvrj.com/news/titus-to-announce-run-for-1st-district-seat-132958858.html|title=Titus to announce new bid for Congress|date=October 31, 2011|accessdate=November 2, 2011|work=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]]|first=Laura|last=Myers}}</ref> She initially faced a challenge from State Senator [[Ruben Kihuen]] in the Democratic primary. Kihuen dropped out in February 2012, reportedly due to Titus leading him in polls and fundraising.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://slashpolitics.reviewjournal.com/2012/02/07/kihuen-out-in-1st-congressional-district/|title=Kihuen out in 1st Congressional District|date=February 7, 2012}}</ref>  This all but assured Titus' return to Congress after a two-year absence.  She easily defeated her Republican challenger, Chris Edwards.

Wright's studies in his field of expertise, [[Latin American history]], has taken the couple on extended journeys throughout Central and South American and to Spain.
