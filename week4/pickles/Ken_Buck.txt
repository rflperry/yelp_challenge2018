'''Kenneth R. "Ken" Buck''' (born February 16, 1959) is the [[District Attorney]] for [[Weld County, Colorado]], and the U.S. representative-elect for [[Colorado's 4th congressional district]]. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], Buck was also the unsuccessful GOP challenger to [[Michael Bennet]] in the [[United States Senate election in Colorado, 2010|2010 Senate race in Colorado]].

==Early life and education==
Buck was born in [[Ossining (village), New York|Ossining, New York]] in 1959.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/10/04/how-old-is-ken-buck/|title=How Old Is Ken Buck?|date=2010-10-04|work=Politics Daily|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> He and his two brothers were encouraged by their parents, both New York lawyers, to attend [[Ivy League]] colleges,<ref name=background/> and Buck earned his undergraduate degree from [[Princeton University]] in 1981. Buck later said that the Princeton degree was "more important to [my father] than me".<ref name=background/> Buck played four years of football at Princeton, one year as a defensive back/punter/kicker and three years as a punter, earning All-Ivy League honors as a punter his senior year.<ref>[http://www.princeton.edu/football/allivy.html Princeton University football archive]</ref>

After college Buck moved west and worked in [[Wyoming]] at the state legislative services office and received a [[Juris Doctorate|law degree]] from the [[University of Wyoming College of Law]] in 1985. He was also an instructor at the [[University of Denver]] Law School and for the [[National Institute for Trial Advocacy]] in Colorado.

==Career==

===U.S. Attorney's Office===
In 1986, he was hired by Congressman [[Dick Cheney]] to work on the [[Iran-Contra]] investigation. Following that assignment, he worked as a prosecutor with the [[U.S. Department of Justice]] in Washington D.C.<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_16175688 |title=Bucks' East Coast ambition meets West allure |publisher=Denver Post |date=2010-09-26 |author=Allison Sherry |accessdate=2010-10-30}}</ref>

In 1990 Buck joined the [[United States Attorney's Office]] for the District of Colorado where he became Chief of the Criminal Division. Buck was formally reprimanded and required to take ethics classes in 2001 for a meeting he had with defense attorneys about a felony case he thought should not be pursued.<ref name=background>Allison Sherry [http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_15626839 "Ken Buck's family background helps him stand strong on principles"] July 29, 2010, ''Denver Post''</ref><ref name=belittle>Allison Sherry [http://www.denverpost.com/ci_15364174 "Belittled case drew Senate candidate Buck a rebuke from boss"] June 24, 2010, ''The Denver Post''</ref> Only one of the three men initially indicted on felony charges was convicted, for a misdemeanor offense.<ref name=belittle/> Buck said he is "not proud" of the incident that effectively ended his career with the Justice Department,<ref name=belittle/> but says he felt it was "unethical" to prosecute such a "weak" case against the three men.<ref name=conversation/> One of the three men donated $700 to Buck's 2010 Senate campaign.<ref name=belittle/>

===Weld County District Attorney===
Buck was elected the District Attorney for [[Weld County, Colorado]] in 2004. When he suspected that [[Social Security number]]s were being stolen by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], he raided a tax service in [[Greeley, Colorado]] and seized more than 5,000 tax files. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] sued Buck's office for violating the privacy of the service's clients and after an appeal to the [[Colorado Supreme Court]], costing the county approximately $150,000, the raid was deemed unconstitutional.<ref name=background/> Buck has said that his time enforcing laws for the Justice Department and Weld County stoked his desire to become a lawmaker himself.<ref name=background/>

During the 2010 Senate race, ''The Colorado Independent'' ran an article entitled "Suspect in 2005 Buck [[rape]] case said he knew it was rape,".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/63925/suspect-in-troubling-05-buck-case-said-he-knew-it-was-rape|title=Suspect in troubling '05 Buck case said he knew it was rape|work=[[The Colorado Independent]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>  The article, about a case Buck refused to prosecute in 2006, included a complete transcript of a tape between the victim and her attacker, including the following dialogue:
{{quote|
Victim: “You do realize that … it’s rape.”

Suspect: “Yeah, I do.”

Victim: “Like in a number of different ways, because I didn’t want to do it and because I was intoxicated and because I was afraid.”

Suspect: “Yes I do. I know.”}}

The tape, which Greeley police had the victim record during their investigation, was available before Buck made his decision not to prosecute the woman's admitted rapist.
According to a following article in the ''Independent'', "Buck’s refusal to prosecute 2005 rape case reverberates in U.S. Senate race,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/63491/bucks-refusal-to-prosecute-2005-rape-case-reverberates-in-u-s-senate-race|title=Buck's refusal to prosecute 2005 rape case reverberates in U.S. Senate race|work=[[The Colorado Independent]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> the reporter provides a transcript of another tape of a conversation between the woman and Buck, in which "Buck appears to all but blame her for the rape and tells her that her case would never fly with a Weld County jury."

“A jury could very well conclude that this is a case of buyer’s remorse,” he told the ''Greeley Tribune'' in 2006.<ref>http://www.greeleytribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060301/NEWS/103010095&parentprofile=&template=printart {{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>

“That comment made me feel horrible,” the victim told the ''Colorado Independent'' in 2010. “The offender admitted he did it, but Ken Buck said I was to blame. Had he (Buck) not attacked me, I might have let it go. But he put the blame on me, and I was furious. I still am furious,” she said.
According to the ''Independent'', "A man entered the alleged victim’s apartment and had sex with her while she was drunk, she says. As she passed in and out of consciousness, she says she told him “no” and tried to push him away. If he had been a stranger, the case may have played out differently, but he was a former lover, and she had invited him over."

In the meeting that she recorded, Buck said, “It appears to me … that you invited him over to have sex with him," and that he thought she might have wanted to file rape charges to retaliate against the man for some bad feeling left over from when they had been lovers more than a year earlier. According the ''Independent'', "Buck also comes off on this tape as being at least as concerned with the woman’s sexual history and alcohol consumption as he is with other facts of the case."

Drawing on Buck's abortion stance, the ''Independent'' also points out that "The suspect in this case had claimed that the victim had at one point a year or so before this event become pregnant with his child and had an [[abortion]], which she denies, saying she [[miscarriage|miscarried]]. The suspect’s claim, though, is in the police report, and Buck refers to it as a reason she may be motivated to file charges where he thinks none are warranted."

Buck supports the U.S. military's "[[Don’t ask, don’t tell]]" policy. He said, “I do not support the repeal of don't ask don't tell. I think it is a policy that makes a lot of sense.”<ref>{{cite news|work=Greeley Gazette|title=Senate debates reveal stark differences between candidates :: Northern Colorado Gazette|date=September 27, 2010|url=http://www.greeleygazette.com/press/?p=5689|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> Buck believes that being [[gay]] is a choice.

==2010 United States Senate campaign==
{{See also|United States Senate election in Colorado, 2010}}

===Republican primary===
Angered by what he later called the nation's "lurch to the [[Left-wing politics|left]],<ref name=conversation>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15527703 | work=The Denver Post | title=A conversation with Ken Buck | date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Buck announced his plans to run for U.S. senator on April 28, 2009.<ref>Federal Election Commission filing; [http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/99995-ken-buck-us-senate Ken Buck for U.S. Senate], ''The Colorado Statesman'', May 1, 2010</ref>  In his first run for state-wide office, Buck frequently referenced national issues in defining his goals as a U.S. senator.  Among these were his opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (a program of federal economic stimulus initiated under President [[George W. Bush]] and finalized under President [[Barack Obama]]) and the role of federal policy [[Czar (political term)|czars]].<ref name=conversation/> Buck also stressed mounting governmental debt, an issue to which he was to frequently return throughout the primary campaign.<ref name=conversation/> Buck, contrasting himself to what he argued was the "top down" style of early Republican favorite Lieutenant Governor [[Jane Norton]], also pledged a "bottom-up" campaign that would include visits to each of Colorado's 64 counties.<ref name=conversation/>

Initially Norton was seen to have had a nearly insurmountable advantage against "a band of underfunded unknowns" that included Buck, who early in the primary season was called "a dead-in-the-water Republican U.S. Senate candidate with laughable fundraising totals and little establishment GOP support". Norton's staff at the beginning of the campaign was twice the size of Buck's. He attempted to make a virtue of his meager war chest by positioning "himself as the small-money underdog" in an election cycle that saw a "[[populism|populist]] push for outsider candidates to upset the Washington establishment".<ref name="ci_14886345">{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14886345|title=Long-shot Senate candidate Buck hits bull's-eye in Colo. - The Denver Post|work=The Denver Post|accessdate=13 December 2013|first=Allison|last=Sherry|date=15 April 2010}}</ref>

After receiving nearly $600,000 in a television advertising support from [[Americans for Job Security]] and a victory in March at the state party's caucuses, Buck began to receive endorsements and notice. By late spring of 2010, Colorado had highly competitive Republican and [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] primaries.<ref name="ci_14886345" />

Although Buck positioned himself as the candidate for the [[Tea Party movement]] during the Republican primary,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_15600796 | work=Denver Post | first=Allison | last=Sherry | title=Senate hopeful Buck regrets criticism of Tea Party birthers | date=July 26, 2010}}</ref> he stirred controversy at times with remarks critical of former Rep. [[Tom Tancredo]], a Tea Party favorite, and the statement "Will you tell those dumbasses at the Tea Party to stop asking questions about birth certificates while I'm on the camera?" &mdash; a reference to [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|those suspicious of President Barack Obama's place of birth]]. Buck blamed the comments on his exhaustion and frustration after months of campaigning, and on his exasperation that it was difficult to keep campaign debate focused on the issue of mounting governmental debt.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14886345 ''The Denver Post'' on Buck's ties to Tea Party]</ref> Tea Party leader Lu Busse criticized Buck's "choice of words" and inclination to treat all Tea Party adherents as a uniform group.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_15600796 ''The Denver Post'' on Lu Busse's comments]</ref>

Buck again stirred controversy by suggesting voters should cast their votes for him over Norton because, unlike his female competitor, "I do not wear high heels."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/in-colorado-race-a-focus-on-footwear/|title=In Colorado race, a focus on footwear|date=2010-07-22|work=The Caucus (blog)|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 December 2013|first=Janie|last=Lorber}}</ref><ref>[http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2010/07/22/high-heel-remark-shoe-horned-into-ad-rotation/12184 ''The Denver Post'' on Buck's "high heels" comment]</ref> Buck later stated that he was responding to Norton's television ad claiming he was not "man enough" to attack her himself.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011333-503544.html CBS News coverage of Buck controversy re "high heels" comment]</ref>
(According to mass email, sent on behalf of Senator [[Jim DeMint]], it was a joking paraphrase of his opponent's suggestion to vote for her, "because I wear high heels").

Making reference to Buck's mandatory ethics classes, Norton argued that she "didn't need an ethics class to know what's right. ... Ken broke the rules, and the facts speak for themselves."<ref name="bedfellows">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2010/06/24/odd-bedfellows-together-scold-buck/10944/|title=Colorado Democrats and GOP Senate hopeful Jane Norton scold Ken Buck|date=2010-06-24|work=The Spot (blog)|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> After Buck's former supervisor, U.S. Attorney John Suthers, endorsed Norton, the Colorado Democratic Party Chair called for Buck's resignation from his Weld County post because of his "career bypassing justice and ethics to reward political allies and campaign contributors".<ref name=bedfellows/>

On August 19, 2013, Buck emailed supporters and announced that the [[lymphoma]] he had been diagnosed with was in remission following treatment and he would run against Senator [[Mark Udall]] in 2014.

==Personal life==
Buck married his Princeton girlfriend in 1984, and they divorced in 1994. His mother introduced him to his current wife, Perry, after meeting her at a gathering for antiques collectors; they married in 1996. Formerly a successful banker and businesswoman, Perry Buck has "given up much of her professional life" to support her husband in his Senate campaign.<ref name="denverpost1">[http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_15626839 ''The Denver Post'' on Buck's personal life]</ref> He has two children from his first marriage.

When he suspected that [[Social Security number]]s were being stolen by [[illegal immigration|illegal immigrants]], he raided a tax service in [[Greeley, Colorado]] and seized more than 5,000 tax files. The [[American Civil Liberties Union]] sued Buck's office for violating the privacy of the service's clients and after an appeal to the [[Colorado Supreme Court]], costing the county approximately $150,000, the raid was deemed unconstitutional.<ref name=background/> Buck has said that his time enforcing laws for the Justice Department and Weld County stoked his desire to become a lawmaker himself.<ref name=background/>

During the 2010 Senate race, ''The Colorado Independent'' ran an article entitled "Suspect in 2005 Buck [[rape]] case said he knew it was rape,".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/63925/suspect-in-troubling-05-buck-case-said-he-knew-it-was-rape|title=Suspect in troubling '05 Buck case said he knew it was rape|work=[[The Colorado Independent]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref>  The article, about a case Buck refused to prosecute in 2006, included a complete transcript of a tape between the victim and her attacker, including the following dialogue:
{{quote|
Victim: “You do realize that … it’s rape.”

Suspect: “Yeah, I do.”

Victim: “Like in a number of different ways, because I didn’t want to do it and because I was intoxicated and because I was afraid.”

Suspect: “Yes I do. I know.”}}

The tape, which Greeley police had the victim record during their investigation, was available before Buck made his decision not to prosecute the woman's admitted rapist.
According to a following article in the ''Independent'', "Buck’s refusal to prosecute 2005 rape case reverberates in U.S. Senate race,"<ref>{{cite news|url=http://coloradoindependent.com/63491/bucks-refusal-to-prosecute-2005-rape-case-reverberates-in-u-s-senate-race|title=Buck's refusal to prosecute 2005 rape case reverberates in U.S. Senate race|work=[[The Colorado Independent]]|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> the reporter provides a transcript of another tape of a conversation between the woman and Buck, in which "Buck appears to all but blame her for the rape and tells her that her case would never fly with a Weld County jury."

“A jury could very well conclude that this is a case of buyer’s remorse,” he told the ''Greeley Tribune'' in 2006.<ref>http://www.greeleytribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060301/NEWS/103010095&parentprofile=&template=printart {{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref>

“That comment made me feel horrible,” the victim told the ''Colorado Independent'' in 2010. “The offender admitted he did it, but Ken Buck said I was to blame. Had he (Buck) not attacked me, I might have let it go. But he put the blame on me, and I was furious. I still am furious,” she said.
According to the ''Independent'', "A man entered the alleged victim’s apartment and had sex with her while she was drunk, she says. As she passed in and out of consciousness, she says she told him “no” and tried to push him away. If he had been a stranger, the case may have played out differently, but he was a former lover, and she had invited him over."

In the meeting that she recorded, Buck said, “It appears to me … that you invited him over to have sex with him," and that he thought she might have wanted to file rape charges to retaliate against the man for some bad feeling left over from when they had been lovers more than a year earlier. According the ''Independent'', "Buck also comes off on this tape as being at least as concerned with the woman’s sexual history and alcohol consumption as he is with other facts of the case."

Drawing on Buck's abortion stance, the ''Independent'' also points out that "The suspect in this case had claimed that the victim had at one point a year or so before this event become pregnant with his child and had an [[abortion]], which she denies, saying she [[miscarriage|miscarried]]. The suspect’s claim, though, is in the police report, and Buck refers to it as a reason she may be motivated to file charges where he thinks none are warranted."

===Republican primary===
Angered by what he later called the nation's "lurch to the [[Left-wing politics|left]],<ref name=conversation>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_15527703 | work=The Denver Post | title=A conversation with Ken Buck | date=July 18, 2010}}</ref> Buck announced his plans to run for U.S. senator on April 28, 2009.<ref>Federal Election Commission filing; [http://www.coloradostatesman.com/content/99995-ken-buck-us-senate Ken Buck for U.S. Senate], ''The Colorado Statesman'', May 1, 2010</ref>  In his first run for state-wide office, Buck frequently referenced national issues in defining his goals as a U.S. senator.  Among these were his opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]] (a program of federal economic stimulus initiated under President [[George W. Bush]] and finalized under President [[Barack Obama]]) and the role of federal policy [[Czar (political term)|czars]].<ref name=conversation/> Buck also stressed mounting governmental debt, an issue to which he was to frequently return throughout the primary campaign.<ref name=conversation/> Buck, contrasting himself to what he argued was the "top down" style of early Republican favorite Lieutenant Governor [[Jane Norton]], also pledged a "bottom-up" campaign that would include visits to each of Colorado's 64 counties.<ref name=conversation/>

Initially Norton was seen to have had a nearly insurmountable advantage against "a band of underfunded unknowns" that included Buck, who early in the primary season was called "a dead-in-the-water Republican U.S. Senate candidate with laughable fundraising totals and little establishment GOP support". Norton's staff at the beginning of the campaign was twice the size of Buck's. He attempted to make a virtue of his meager war chest by positioning "himself as the small-money underdog" in an election cycle that saw a "[[populism|populist]] push for outsider candidates to upset the Washington establishment".<ref name="ci_14886345">{{cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14886345|title=Long-shot Senate candidate Buck hits bull's-eye in Colo. - The Denver Post|work=The Denver Post|accessdate=13 December 2013|first=Allison|last=Sherry|date=15 April 2010}}</ref>

After receiving nearly $600,000 in a television advertising support from [[Americans for Job Security]] and a victory in March at the state party's caucuses, Buck began to receive endorsements and notice. By late spring of 2010, Colorado had highly competitive Republican and [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] primaries.<ref name="ci_14886345" />

Although Buck positioned himself as the candidate for the [[Tea Party movement]] during the Republican primary,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_15600796 | work=Denver Post | first=Allison | last=Sherry | title=Senate hopeful Buck regrets criticism of Tea Party birthers | date=July 26, 2010}}</ref> he stirred controversy at times with remarks critical of former Rep. [[Tom Tancredo]], a Tea Party favorite, and the statement "Will you tell those dumbasses at the Tea Party to stop asking questions about birth certificates while I'm on the camera?" &mdash; a reference to [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories|those suspicious of President Barack Obama's place of birth]]. Buck blamed the comments on his exhaustion and frustration after months of campaigning, and on his exasperation that it was difficult to keep campaign debate focused on the issue of mounting governmental debt.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/news/ci_14886345 ''The Denver Post'' on Buck's ties to Tea Party]</ref> Tea Party leader Lu Busse criticized Buck's "choice of words" and inclination to treat all Tea Party adherents as a uniform group.<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/election2010/ci_15600796 ''The Denver Post'' on Lu Busse's comments]</ref>

Buck again stirred controversy by suggesting voters should cast their votes for him over Norton because, unlike his female competitor, "I do not wear high heels."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/07/22/in-colorado-race-a-focus-on-footwear/|title=In Colorado race, a focus on footwear|date=2010-07-22|work=The Caucus (blog)|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=13 December 2013|first=Janie|last=Lorber}}</ref><ref>[http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2010/07/22/high-heel-remark-shoe-horned-into-ad-rotation/12184 ''The Denver Post'' on Buck's "high heels" comment]</ref> Buck later stated that he was responding to Norton's television ad claiming he was not "man enough" to attack her himself.<ref>[http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20011333-503544.html CBS News coverage of Buck controversy re "high heels" comment]</ref>
(According to mass email, sent on behalf of Senator [[Jim DeMint]], it was a joking paraphrase of his opponent's suggestion to vote for her, "because I wear high heels").

Making reference to Buck's mandatory ethics classes, Norton argued that she "didn't need an ethics class to know what's right. ... Ken broke the rules, and the facts speak for themselves."<ref name="bedfellows">{{cite news|url=http://blogs.denverpost.com/thespot/2010/06/24/odd-bedfellows-together-scold-buck/10944/|title=Colorado Democrats and GOP Senate hopeful Jane Norton scold Ken Buck|date=2010-06-24|work=The Spot (blog)|publisher=The Denver Post|accessdate=13 December 2013}}</ref> After Buck's former supervisor, U.S. Attorney John Suthers, endorsed Norton, the Colorado Democratic Party Chair called for Buck's resignation from his Weld County post because of his "career bypassing justice and ethics to reward political allies and campaign contributors".<ref name=bedfellows/>

On August 10, Buck defeated Norton in the Republican primary election by a 52% to 48% margin,<ref>[http://www.denverpost.com/frontpage/ci_15737667 Buck defeats Norton in bruising GOP primary for Senate seat], Allison Sherry, ''[[The Denver Post]]'', August 11, 2010</ref> the end of "a bitterly contested primary that saw him go from an obscure and cash-starved underdog to a gaffe-prone mascot for anti-establishment conservatives [in Colorado] and nationally."<ref>[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0810/41023.html#ixzz0wVt4FQXr Politico.com]</ref>
