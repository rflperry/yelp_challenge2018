Roe defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Rob Russell, director of the Writing and Communication Center at [[East Tennessee State University]],<ref>[http://www.etsu.edu/academicaffairs/wcc/default.aspx ETSU Writing and Communication Center]</ref> in the November general election with 72 percent of the vote.  However, it was [[tantamount to election|widely presumed]] that Roe had clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary; Republicans have held the 1st District seat continuously since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859.

Roe won re-election in 2010 with 80.8% of the vote against Democrat Michael Clark.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2010/maps/#/House/2010/TN</ref>

===Tenure===
In a district known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington, U.S. Rep. Phil Roe has promised to serve only 12 years (six terms) in the House. 

Roe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman [[Robin Hayes]], as his chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roe hires chief of staff, will step down as Johnson City mayor |first=Hank |last=Hayes |date=December 17, 2008 |url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9010441 |work=[[Kingsport Times-News]] |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> According to [[National Journal]]’s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nw_20100227_7237.php |title=2009 VOTE RATINGS |date=February 27, 2010 |work=National Journal}}</ref>

On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the [[National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress)]] into the House. The bill would authorize the [[National Desert Storm Memorial Association]] to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] or [[Operation Desert Shield]].<ref name=cbo503>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 503|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45267|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> Roe said "I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward."<ref name=roePRpass>{{cite web|title=Roe Bill to Establish War Memorial Passes House of Representatives|url=http://roe.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=381365|publisher=House Office of Phil Roe|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

During June 2013, WJHL TV of Johnson City, Tennessee reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in Greeneville, Tennessee on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were "money and greed" and because that decision by Kincaid created a "substantial risk of harm to patients," prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.<ref>http://www.wjhl.com/story/22467984/dr-kincaid-begs-judge-for-mercy-congressman-and-sheriff-write-letters-on-his-behalf "Dr. Kincaid begs judge for mercy, congressman and sheriff write letters on his behalf".

===Tenure===
In a district known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington, U.S. Rep. Phil Roe has promised to serve only 12 years (six terms) in the House. 

Roe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman [[Robin Hayes]], as his chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roe hires chief of staff, will step down as Johnson City mayor |first=Hank |last=Hayes |date=December 17, 2008 |url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9010441 |work=[[Kingsport Times-News]] |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> According to [[National Journal]]’s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nw_20100227_7237.php |title=2009 VOTE RATINGS |date=February 27, 2010 |work=National Journal}}</ref>

On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the [[National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress)]] into the House. The bill would authorize the [[National Desert Storm Memorial Association]] to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] or [[Operation Desert Shield]].<ref name=cbo503>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 503|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45267|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> Roe said "I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward."<ref name=roePRpass>{{cite web|title=Roe Bill to Establish War Memorial Passes House of Representatives|url=http://roe.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=381365|publisher=House Office of Phil Roe|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

During June 2013, WJHL TV of Johnson City, Tennessee reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in Greeneville, Tennessee on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were "money and greed" and because that decision by Kincaid created a "substantial risk of harm to patients," prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.<ref>http://www.wjhl.com/story/22467984/dr-kincaid-begs-judge-for-mercy-congressman-and-sheriff-write-letters-on-his-behalf "Dr. Kincaid begs judge for mercy, congressman and sheriff write letters on his behalf".
