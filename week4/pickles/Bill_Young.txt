'''Charles William "Bill" Young''' (December 16, 1930 – October 18, 2013) was an [[United States|American]] politician who served in the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 1971 to 2013. A [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] from [[Florida]], Young served as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Committee on Appropriations]] from 1999 to 2005. He was the [[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|longest-serving Republican member of Congress]] at the time of his death.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Young was born in [[Harmarville, Pennsylvania]], a suburb of [[Pittsburgh]], in 1930.<ref name=njbio>{{cite news |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/bill-young-fl/ |title=Rep.

==Florida Senate==
[[File:C.W. "Bill" Young.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Young in 1968.]]
In 1960 Young was elected to the [[Florida Senate]], where he served from 1961 to 1970, and was minority leader in that chamber from 1966 to 1970.<ref name="biocong">{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=y000031 |title="Young, Charles W.

From 1962 through 1964, Young served on the [[Florida Legislative Investigation Committee]], commonly known as the Johns Committee (for its Chairman [[Charley Eugene Johns]]), a legislative panel that investigated the activities of homosexuals, communists and others thought to be subversive. In 1964, the committee released a pamphlet entitled ''[[Homosexuality and Citizenship in Florida]]'', which drew criticism at the time for its use of explicit photographs of homosexual acts.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://ufdc.ufl.edu/UF00004805/00001 |title=Homosexuality and citizenship in Florida |work=University of Florida Digital Collections |date=January 1964 |accessdate=September 23, 2011}}</ref> At the time, Young said of homosexuality: "Our report tried to show it in its true light – it's a very repulsive subject."<ref name=Barstow>{{cite news|last=Barstow|first=David|title=Congressman says little about involvement|accessdate=September 23, 2011|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=July 2, 1993|pages=6A}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/sptimes/access/51711200.html?dids=51711200:51711200&FMT=ABS&FMTS=ABS:FT&type=current&date=Jul+02%2C+1993&author=DAVID+BARSTOW&pub=St.+Petersburg+Times&desc=Congressman+says+little+about+involvement+Series%3A |title=Congressman says little about involvement (online abstract of article) |newspaper=St. Petersburg Times |date=July 2, 1993 |accessdate=September 23, 2011 |first=David |last=Barstow}}</ref> Responding to reports that reprints of the pamphlet were being sold as pornography for a gay audience, Young said: "This indicates how bold the homosexual is becoming and further proves the necessity of state government taking the lead in responsibility for preventing these confirmed homosexuals from preying on the youth of the state."<ref name=Barstow/> In 1993, Young was asked about his involvement with the report by the ''[[St. Petersburg Times]]'' and said: "I am not supportive of homosexuality, but that's the decision of the people who are involved in it. If someone wants to engage in that sort of behavior, that's their choice." Young also stated that the committee was largely inactive during his tenure due to the illness of its chair, [[Charley Eugene Johns]], and that he was not involved enough in the committee to be either proud or regretful of its work.<ref name=Barstow/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 13}}
[[File:Bill Young official photo.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Young's official portrait]]
Young was elected to Congress in 1970 from what was then the 8th District and was reelected 20 times. The district, which changed numbers four times during Young's tenure (it was the 8th District from 1971 to 1973, the 6th District from 1973 to 1983, the 8th District again from 1983 to 1993, the 10th from 1993 to 2013 and has been the 13th since 2013) was once considered a Republican stronghold. However, it has become much friendlier to [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] candidates in recent years, at least on the national level. Since 1988, it has supported a Republican for president only once, in 2004. Despite the Democratic trend in his district at the national level, Young usually skated to reelection. He only twice received less than 60% of the vote, in 1992 and 2012.

===Tenure===
Having been a member of the Appropriations Committee for his entire time in congress, Young is known best for bringing federal dollars to [[Pinellas County, Florida|Pinellas County]]. His earmarks have been used for U.S. Highway 19, [[high tech]] jobs, healthcare for children, clean water, and defense contractors.  This was a major reason why he was able to hold onto his seat for so long; it is considered extremely difficult to defeat an Appropriations Committee member at an election.

====1970s====
In 1974, all four Republican congressmen from Florida said they would support [[Impeachment in the United States|impeaching]] President [[Richard Nixon]] over [[Watergate Scandal]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Je4vAAAAIBAJ&sjid=AvsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=7232,1747026&dq=bill+young+florida&hl=en Lakeland Ledger - Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

In the [[United States presidential election, 1976|1976 Republican primary for president]], Young endorsed President [[Gerald Ford]] over [[California Governor]] [[Ronald Reagan]].<ref>[http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=uLoqAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LmcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5757,141288&dq=cw+young+florida&hl=en Sarasota Herald-Tribune - Google News Archive Search<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

====1980s====
In 1980, Young endorsed moderate [[George H.W.

He was instrumental in creating a national registry for bone marrow donors in 1986. Now named after him, it lists nearly 10 million volunteer donors and has facilitated transplants for more than 50,000 people.<ref>{{cite news|author=Zengerle, Patricia|title=Rep.

====1990s====
After the 1994 [[Republican Revolution]], [[US House Speaker|House Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]] gave the position of chairman of the Appropriations Committee to [[Bob Livingston]] of Louisiana instead of Young, even though Young had more seniority. When [[Dennis Hastert]] became speaker in 1999, Young finally became the chairman.<ref>{{cite news|author=Catalina Camia , USA TODAY 11:11 p.m. EDT October 18, 2013 |url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/10/18/cw-bill-young-florida-dies-obituary-congress/3002723/ |title=Rep.

Young strongly supported increases in defense spending and sent letters to Congressman [[John Kasich]], Chairman of the Budget Committee, recommending an increase in [[Department of Defense (United States)|DOD]] funding.<ref>{{cite news|author=By ERIC SCHMITTPublished: January 29, 1995 |url=http://www.nytimes.com/1995/01/29/us/republicans-finding-dissension-in-ranks-on-military-issues.html |title=Republicans Finding Dissension in Ranks on Military Issues - New York Times |publisher=Nytimes.com |date=January 29, 1995 |accessdate=January 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0F1219EF2D3A4&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=NewsLibrary Search Results}}</ref> Young strongly supported the [[F-22 Raptor]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=WT&p_theme=wt&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=0EB0F3534A768F36&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM | title=NewsLibrary Search Results}}</ref>

In a 1999 [[New York Times]] interview, Young stated, "In my short life I've been shot, I've been hit by a truck, survived an airplane crash, I've had my chest opened and my heart rebuilt. And it's sort of hard to get me flustered after all that."<ref name=NYT />

====2000s====
In 2005, Young received 3,570 [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] requests from members of Congress, because it was his last year as chairman of the committee. He believed that requests for earmarks should not be publicly disclosed. In March 2006, Young spokesman Harry Glenn said "This has been the policy of the committee for years. It's internal correspondence from one member to another."<ref>{{Wayback |date=20060320152052 |url=http://www.tbo.com/news/metro/MGB5MTE1CKE.html |title=Harris Shuns Spending Requests }} March 3, 2006.

At the [[2006 State of the Union Address|State of the Union Address]] on January 31, 2006, authorities expressly prohibited the display of political ideology on clothing in the U.S. Capitol. Young's wife was asked to leave shortly after anti-war activist [[Cindy Sheehan]] was ejected for wearing an anti-war T-shirt. Beverly Young's T-shirt stated: "Support the Troops — Defending Our Freedom." She argued with [[United States Capitol Police|Capitol Hill Police]] officers in the hallway outside the House chamber. "They said I was protesting," she told the ''St. Petersburg Times''. "I said, 'Read my shirt, it is not a protest.' They said, 'We consider that a protest.' I said, 'Then you are an idiot.'" Young was angry about the way his wife was treated. "Because she had on a shirt that someone didn't like that said support our troops, she was kicked out of this gallery," Young said on the House floor the following day, holding up the gray shirt. "Shame, shame," he said.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2006-02-01-sheehan-charges_x.htm |title=Police apologize, drop charge against Sheehan (Posted 2/1/2006 6:14&nbsp;pm) |work=USA Today |date=February 1, 2006 }}</ref> Capitol Police Chief [[Terrance W.

Young supported over $70 million in combined earmarks to two companies that employed his sons, both before and after they were employees. Young's son, Patrick, was employed by defense contractor [[Science Applications International Corporation|SAIC]] when the company reportedly benefited from earmarks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/politics/local/article448561.ece |title=Rep.

In 2011, Young resisted a request by the Pentagon to transfer $863 million in funds from Humvee production to intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance for the conflict in Afghanistan.

After eleven years of supporting the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|Afghanistan wars]],  Young turned against the war in 2012 after Army Staff Sgt. Matthew S. Sitton of Largo was killed in Afghanistan after sending Young a letter pointing out problems there and predicting his own death.

==Other activities==
Young served as a member of the Florida Constitution Revision Commission from 1965 to 1967. He was also a Florida delegate to the [[Republican National Convention]] in 1968, 1972, 1976, and 1984.<ref name="biocong"/>

==Personal life==
Young married Marian Ford on August 20, 1949, when he was an 18-year-old high school dropout and she was 17, entering her senior year at St. Petersburg High School.<ref name=firstfam/>  They had three children: Terry, Pamela, and Kimber. In 1985, after 36 years of marriage, Young divorced Marian.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. Rep. C.W. Bill Young dies at 82|newspaper=Tampa Bay Times|date=October 18, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2014|url=http://www.tampabay.com/news/obituaries/congressional-legend-cw-bill-young-dies-at-82/2148018}}</ref> As part of the divorce agreement, Marian received $2,000 per month in [[alimony]] in exchange for agreeing to seal the divorce records and not speaking publicly about it during Young's lifetime. Eight days after the divorce became final, Young married Beverly Angello, who had worked as a secretary in his congressional office and was 25 years his junior.<ref name=firstfam/> Young and Beverly had two children together: Charles William "Billy" (who was born in 1984, while Young was still married to Marian)<ref name=firstfam/> and Patrick, in addition to Beverly's son, Robbie, from her first marriage.<ref>{{cite news|last=Adair|first=Bill|title=Capitol Hill wife who just won't sit still|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2005/12/19/Worldandnation/Capitol_Hill_wife_who.shtml|accessdate=October 11, 2012|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=December 19, 2005}}</ref>

On October 18, 2013, Young died at Walter Reed Hospital in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] at the age of 82. He had been hospitalized for almost two weeks after suffering a broken hip and fractured pelvis.<ref name=firstfam/> Doctors could not perform hip surgery because of brittle bones caused by multiple myeloma, a blood cancer that forms in bone marrow.<ref name=firstfam/><ref>

On January 6, 2014, Marian Young and the three children from his first marriage spoke out for the first time since Young's death.  Marian said that her lawyer had specifically asked her to keep silent about her husband's affair with Beverly due to concerns that he would lose his congressional seat.  Even though the divorce records were sealed, many journalists at the time "knew about the affair and the [extramarital child's] birth, but believed such issues fell outside the public's right to know."  Terry, Pamela and Kimber also claimed that they had only heard from their father sporadically in the three decades following the divorce.<ref name=firstfam/>
