She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

She is the ranking member on both the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|House Committee on House Administration]] [[United States House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight|Subcommittee on Oversight]], and on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
A [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] resident, Lofgren attended [[Gunn High School]] (1966) in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]],<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L-_zoKQ-mvQC&pg=PA26&dq=john+collins+married+lofgren+zoe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YfreU7XlBceYyATpgYKgDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=john%20collins%20married%20lofgren%20zoe&f=false |title=Official Congressional Directory, 2005–2006, 109th Congress, Convened ... |publisher=Congress, Joint Committee on Printing |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the [[Junior State of America]], a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsa.org/wp-content/uploads/JSA-notables.doc|title=Notable Alumni of the Junior State of America}}</ref> She earned her B.A. at [[Stanford University]] (1970) and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at [[Santa Clara University School of Law]] (1975).<ref name="google1"/> 

In 1978 she married John Marshall Collins.<ref name="google2"/>  She left the San Jose area for a few years after graduation from Stanford, to serve as a staff assistant to Congressman [[Don Edwards]], in whose office she worked on, among other projects, the attempted impeachment of Richard Nixon.{{fact|date=August 2014}} She was also instrumental in the creation of a [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge|Bay Area wilderness area]] that now bears the name of Edwards.{{fact|date=August 2014}} 

Returning to San Jose, Lofgren worked in Edwards' district office, while at the same time earning her law degree. After two years as partner at an immigration law firm in San Jose, she was elected first to a community college board, then to the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[board of supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], where she served for 13 years.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Lofgren also spent three years teaching classes on immigration law at her former law school at Santa Clara University.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1994, Lofgren entered the Democratic primary, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. It was the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.  A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor [[Tom McEnery]]. Lofgren's victory virtually assured her of becoming only the second person to represent the district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th District from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993 and has been the 16th since 1993).  She has been reelected eight times with no substantive opposition.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

In 2002, [[Susan Lindauer]], a journalist and antiwar activist, worked for Lofgren as her press secretary for two months.<ref name="autogenerated2004">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/11/iraq.conspiracy.case/ |title=American indicted as Iraqi agent |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> Lofgren was a member of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time.<ref name="autogenerated2004"/>  Lindauer was later charged with spying for the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.<ref name="weeklystandard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/842odgdw.asp |title=Susan Lindauer's Work Record |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>  She was arrested in 2004, incarcerated in 2005, and released the next year.<ref name="weeklystandard1"/><ref>{{cite news|author=David Samuels |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/magazine/susan-lindauer-s-mission-to-baghdad.html |title=Susan Lindauer's Mission To Baghdad |location=Iraq; United States |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> 

[[File:Zoe Lofgren 109th pictorial.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Earlier photo of Lofgren (2005)]]
In 2006, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) reported that Lofgren had paid her husband's firm, Collins and Day, $285,481 in campaign payments over the prior six years for accounting, fundraising, and regulatory compliance services, and her campaign had paid John Marshall Collins PC, a second company controlled by her husband, $62,705 for rent and office services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley |first=Matt |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-17-campaign-funds_N.htm |title=Lawmakers used campaign funds to pay relatives |publisher=usatoday.com |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>

Lofgren is the chair of the 34-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the [[Secure Communities]] deportation program.<ref name="la-now">{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/congresswoman-calls-for-investigation-of-enforcement-program-that-screens-for-illegal-immigrants-in-.html | title=Congresswoman calls for investigation of enforcement program that screens for illegal immigrants in jails | author=Romney, Lee | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

During the 110th Congress, Lofgren worked for the development of [[fusion energy]]. She initiated a bill that would accelerate its uses as an alternative energy solution. Another piece of legislation that she authored has the goal of providing lower Internet access rates to schools, libraries, and other public institutions.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

She is a leader on intellectual property law issues, and has fought against what she views as the unnecessary expansion of copyright law.  Lofgren supports more immigration,{{fact|date=August 2014}}

Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]].  In doing so, she presided over a rare [[Censure in the United States|sanction of censure]], against long-time member [[Charles B. Rangel]].<ref name="wapo-full">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120201626.html?hpid=topnews | title=House censures Rep.

In the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill.  She has also opposed the [[data retention]] requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the [[Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011]]).<ref>{{cite news | first = Grant | last = Gross | title = House Panel Votes to Require ISPs to Keep Customer Records | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/236866/house_panel_votes_to_require_isps_to_keep_customer_records.html | work = PC World | accessdate = October 25, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054356/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 25, 2013 |title=Reps.

She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

She is the ranking member on both the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|House Committee on House Administration]] [[United States House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight|Subcommittee on Oversight]], and on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
A [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] resident, Lofgren attended [[Gunn High School]] (1966) in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]],<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L-_zoKQ-mvQC&pg=PA26&dq=john+collins+married+lofgren+zoe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YfreU7XlBceYyATpgYKgDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=john%20collins%20married%20lofgren%20zoe&f=false |title=Official Congressional Directory, 2005–2006, 109th Congress, Convened ... |publisher=Congress, Joint Committee on Printing |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the [[Junior State of America]], a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsa.org/wp-content/uploads/JSA-notables.doc|title=Notable Alumni of the Junior State of America}}</ref> She earned her B.A. at [[Stanford University]] (1970) and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at [[Santa Clara University School of Law]] (1975).<ref name="google1"/> 

In 1978 she married John Marshall Collins.<ref name="google2"/>  She left the San Jose area for a few years after graduation from Stanford, to serve as a staff assistant to Congressman [[Don Edwards]], in whose office she worked on, among other projects, the attempted impeachment of Richard Nixon.{{fact|date=August 2014}} She was also instrumental in the creation of a [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge|Bay Area wilderness area]] that now bears the name of Edwards.{{fact|date=August 2014}} 

Returning to San Jose, Lofgren worked in Edwards' district office, while at the same time earning her law degree. After two years as partner at an immigration law firm in San Jose, she was elected first to a community college board, then to the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[board of supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], where she served for 13 years.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Lofgren also spent three years teaching classes on immigration law at her former law school at Santa Clara University.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1994, Lofgren entered the Democratic primary, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. It was the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.  A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor [[Tom McEnery]]. Lofgren's victory virtually assured her of becoming only the second person to represent the district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th District from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993 and has been the 16th since 1993).  She has been reelected eight times with no substantive opposition.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

In 2002, [[Susan Lindauer]], a journalist and antiwar activist, worked for Lofgren as her press secretary for two months.<ref name="autogenerated2004">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/11/iraq.conspiracy.case/ |title=American indicted as Iraqi agent |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> Lofgren was a member of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time.<ref name="autogenerated2004"/>  Lindauer was later charged with spying for the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.<ref name="weeklystandard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/842odgdw.asp |title=Susan Lindauer's Work Record |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>  She was arrested in 2004, incarcerated in 2005, and released the next year.<ref name="weeklystandard1"/><ref>{{cite news|author=David Samuels |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/magazine/susan-lindauer-s-mission-to-baghdad.html |title=Susan Lindauer's Mission To Baghdad |location=Iraq; United States |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> 

[[File:Zoe Lofgren 109th pictorial.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Earlier photo of Lofgren (2005)]]
In 2006, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) reported that Lofgren had paid her husband's firm, Collins and Day, $285,481 in campaign payments over the prior six years for accounting, fundraising, and regulatory compliance services, and her campaign had paid John Marshall Collins PC, a second company controlled by her husband, $62,705 for rent and office services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley |first=Matt |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-17-campaign-funds_N.htm |title=Lawmakers used campaign funds to pay relatives |publisher=usatoday.com |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>

Lofgren is the chair of the 34-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the [[Secure Communities]] deportation program.<ref name="la-now">{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/congresswoman-calls-for-investigation-of-enforcement-program-that-screens-for-illegal-immigrants-in-.html | title=Congresswoman calls for investigation of enforcement program that screens for illegal immigrants in jails | author=Romney, Lee | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

During the 110th Congress, Lofgren worked for the development of [[fusion energy]]. She initiated a bill that would accelerate its uses as an alternative energy solution. Another piece of legislation that she authored has the goal of providing lower Internet access rates to schools, libraries, and other public institutions.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

She is a leader on intellectual property law issues, and has fought against what she views as the unnecessary expansion of copyright law.  Lofgren supports more immigration,{{fact|date=August 2014}}

Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]].  In doing so, she presided over a rare [[Censure in the United States|sanction of censure]], against long-time member [[Charles B. Rangel]].<ref name="wapo-full">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120201626.html?hpid=topnews | title=House censures Rep.

In the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill.  She has also opposed the [[data retention]] requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the [[Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011]]).<ref>{{cite news | first = Grant | last = Gross | title = House Panel Votes to Require ISPs to Keep Customer Records | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/236866/house_panel_votes_to_require_isps_to_keep_customer_records.html | work = PC World | accessdate = October 25, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054356/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 25, 2013 |title=Reps.

She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

She is the ranking member on both the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|House Committee on House Administration]] [[United States House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight|Subcommittee on Oversight]], and on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
A [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] resident, Lofgren attended [[Gunn High School]] (1966) in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]],<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L-_zoKQ-mvQC&pg=PA26&dq=john+collins+married+lofgren+zoe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YfreU7XlBceYyATpgYKgDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=john%20collins%20married%20lofgren%20zoe&f=false |title=Official Congressional Directory, 2005–2006, 109th Congress, Convened ... |publisher=Congress, Joint Committee on Printing |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the [[Junior State of America]], a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsa.org/wp-content/uploads/JSA-notables.doc|title=Notable Alumni of the Junior State of America}}</ref> She earned her B.A. at [[Stanford University]] (1970) and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at [[Santa Clara University School of Law]] (1975).<ref name="google1"/> 

In 1978 she married John Marshall Collins.<ref name="google2"/>  She left the San Jose area for a few years after graduation from Stanford, to serve as a staff assistant to Congressman [[Don Edwards]], in whose office she worked on, among other projects, the attempted impeachment of Richard Nixon.{{fact|date=August 2014}} She was also instrumental in the creation of a [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge|Bay Area wilderness area]] that now bears the name of Edwards.{{fact|date=August 2014}} 

Returning to San Jose, Lofgren worked in Edwards' district office, while at the same time earning her law degree. After two years as partner at an immigration law firm in San Jose, she was elected first to a community college board, then to the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[board of supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], where she served for 13 years.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Lofgren also spent three years teaching classes on immigration law at her former law school at Santa Clara University.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1994, Lofgren entered the Democratic primary, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. It was the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.  A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor [[Tom McEnery]]. Lofgren's victory virtually assured her of becoming only the second person to represent the district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th District from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993 and has been the 16th since 1993).  She has been reelected eight times with no substantive opposition.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

In 2002, [[Susan Lindauer]], a journalist and antiwar activist, worked for Lofgren as her press secretary for two months.<ref name="autogenerated2004">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/11/iraq.conspiracy.case/ |title=American indicted as Iraqi agent |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> Lofgren was a member of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time.<ref name="autogenerated2004"/>  Lindauer was later charged with spying for the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.<ref name="weeklystandard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/842odgdw.asp |title=Susan Lindauer's Work Record |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>  She was arrested in 2004, incarcerated in 2005, and released the next year.<ref name="weeklystandard1"/><ref>{{cite news|author=David Samuels |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/magazine/susan-lindauer-s-mission-to-baghdad.html |title=Susan Lindauer's Mission To Baghdad |location=Iraq; United States |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> 

[[File:Zoe Lofgren 109th pictorial.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Earlier photo of Lofgren (2005)]]
In 2006, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) reported that Lofgren had paid her husband's firm, Collins and Day, $285,481 in campaign payments over the prior six years for accounting, fundraising, and regulatory compliance services, and her campaign had paid John Marshall Collins PC, a second company controlled by her husband, $62,705 for rent and office services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley |first=Matt |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-17-campaign-funds_N.htm |title=Lawmakers used campaign funds to pay relatives |publisher=usatoday.com |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>

Lofgren is the chair of the 34-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the [[Secure Communities]] deportation program.<ref name="la-now">{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/congresswoman-calls-for-investigation-of-enforcement-program-that-screens-for-illegal-immigrants-in-.html | title=Congresswoman calls for investigation of enforcement program that screens for illegal immigrants in jails | author=Romney, Lee | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

During the 110th Congress, Lofgren worked for the development of [[fusion energy]]. She initiated a bill that would accelerate its uses as an alternative energy solution. Another piece of legislation that she authored has the goal of providing lower Internet access rates to schools, libraries, and other public institutions.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

She is a leader on intellectual property law issues, and has fought against what she views as the unnecessary expansion of copyright law.  Lofgren supports more immigration,{{fact|date=August 2014}}

Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]].  In doing so, she presided over a rare [[Censure in the United States|sanction of censure]], against long-time member [[Charles B. Rangel]].<ref name="wapo-full">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120201626.html?hpid=topnews | title=House censures Rep.

In the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill.  She has also opposed the [[data retention]] requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the [[Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011]]).<ref>{{cite news | first = Grant | last = Gross | title = House Panel Votes to Require ISPs to Keep Customer Records | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/236866/house_panel_votes_to_require_isps_to_keep_customer_records.html | work = PC World | accessdate = October 25, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054356/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 25, 2013 |title=Reps.

She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district is based in [[San Jose, California|San Jose]].

She is the ranking member on both the [[United States House Committee on House Administration|House Committee on House Administration]] [[United States House Administration Subcommittee on Oversight|Subcommittee on Oversight]], and on the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]] [[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Enforcement]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
A [[San Francisco Bay Area|Bay Area]] resident, Lofgren attended [[Gunn High School]] (1966) in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]],<ref name="google2">{{cite web|url=http://books.google.com/books?id=L-_zoKQ-mvQC&pg=PA26&dq=john+collins+married+lofgren+zoe&hl=en&sa=X&ei=YfreU7XlBceYyATpgYKgDw&ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&q=john%20collins%20married%20lofgren%20zoe&f=false |title=Official Congressional Directory, 2005–2006, 109th Congress, Convened ... |publisher=Congress, Joint Committee on Printing |date= |accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref> and while in high school, Lofgren was a member of the [[Junior State of America]], a student-run political debate, activism, and student governance organization.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsa.org/wp-content/uploads/JSA-notables.doc|title=Notable Alumni of the Junior State of America}}</ref> She earned her B.A. at [[Stanford University]] (1970) and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] at [[Santa Clara University School of Law]] (1975).<ref name="google1"/> 

In 1978 she married John Marshall Collins.<ref name="google2"/>  She left the San Jose area for a few years after graduation from Stanford, to serve as a staff assistant to Congressman [[Don Edwards]], in whose office she worked on, among other projects, the attempted impeachment of Richard Nixon.{{fact|date=August 2014}} She was also instrumental in the creation of a [[Don Edwards San Francisco Bay National Wildlife Refuge|Bay Area wilderness area]] that now bears the name of Edwards.{{fact|date=August 2014}} 

Returning to San Jose, Lofgren worked in Edwards' district office, while at the same time earning her law degree. After two years as partner at an immigration law firm in San Jose, she was elected first to a community college board, then to the [[Santa Clara County, California|Santa Clara County]] [[board of supervisors|Board of Supervisors]], where she served for 13 years.{{fact|date=August 2014}} Lofgren also spent three years teaching classes on immigration law at her former law school at Santa Clara University.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1994, Lofgren entered the Democratic primary, after Edwards retired after 32 years in Congress. It was the real contest in this heavily Democratic district.  A decided underdog, she managed to defeat the favorite, former San Jose mayor [[Tom McEnery]]. Lofgren's victory virtually assured her of becoming only the second person to represent the district since its creation in 1963 (it was numbered as the 9th District from 1963 to 1975, as the 10th from 1975 to 1993 and has been the 16th since 1993).  She has been reelected eight times with no substantive opposition.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

In 2002, [[Susan Lindauer]], a journalist and antiwar activist, worked for Lofgren as her press secretary for two months.<ref name="autogenerated2004">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/03/11/iraq.conspiracy.case/ |title=American indicted as Iraqi agent |publisher=CNN |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> Lofgren was a member of the House Homeland Security Committee at the time.<ref name="autogenerated2004"/>  Lindauer was later charged with spying for the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] prior to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.<ref name="weeklystandard1">{{cite web|url=http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/842odgdw.asp |title=Susan Lindauer's Work Record |publisher=The Weekly Standard |date=March 11, 2004 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>  She was arrested in 2004, incarcerated in 2005, and released the next year.<ref name="weeklystandard1"/><ref>{{cite news|author=David Samuels |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/29/magazine/susan-lindauer-s-mission-to-baghdad.html |title=Susan Lindauer's Mission To Baghdad |location=Iraq; United States |publisher=Nytimes.com |date= |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref> 

[[File:Zoe Lofgren 109th pictorial.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Earlier photo of Lofgren (2005)]]
In 2006, [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) reported that Lofgren had paid her husband's firm, Collins and Day, $285,481 in campaign payments over the prior six years for accounting, fundraising, and regulatory compliance services, and her campaign had paid John Marshall Collins PC, a second company controlled by her husband, $62,705 for rent and office services.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kelley |first=Matt |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2007-06-17-campaign-funds_N.htm |title=Lawmakers used campaign funds to pay relatives |publisher=usatoday.com |date=June 17, 2007 |accessdate=August 3, 2014}}</ref>

Lofgren is the chair of the 34-member California Democratic Congressional Delegation. She serves on the Judiciary Committee and is the chair of the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law. In April 2011, she became the first member of Congress to call for federal investigation into the [[Secure Communities]] deportation program.<ref name="la-now">{{cite news | url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2011/04/congresswoman-calls-for-investigation-of-enforcement-program-that-screens-for-illegal-immigrants-in-.html | title=Congresswoman calls for investigation of enforcement program that screens for illegal immigrants in jails | author=Romney, Lee | newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]] | date=April 22, 2011}}</ref>

During the 110th Congress, Lofgren worked for the development of [[fusion energy]]. She initiated a bill that would accelerate its uses as an alternative energy solution. Another piece of legislation that she authored has the goal of providing lower Internet access rates to schools, libraries, and other public institutions.{{fact|date=August 2014}}

She is a leader on intellectual property law issues, and has fought against what she views as the unnecessary expansion of copyright law.  Lofgren supports more immigration,{{fact|date=August 2014}}

Beginning in 2009, Lofgren served as chair of the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]].  In doing so, she presided over a rare [[Censure in the United States|sanction of censure]], against long-time member [[Charles B. Rangel]].<ref name="wapo-full">{{cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/12/02/AR2010120201626.html?hpid=topnews | title=House censures Rep.

In the [[Stop Online Piracy Act]] [[House Judiciary Committee]] hearings, she defended the current state of the internet in opposition of the bill.  She has also opposed the [[data retention]] requirements in the H.R. 1981 (the [[Protecting Children from Internet Pornographers Act of 2011]]).<ref>{{cite news | first = Grant | last = Gross | title = House Panel Votes to Require ISPs to Keep Customer Records | date = July 28, 2011 | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/236866/house_panel_votes_to_require_isps_to_keep_customer_records.html | work = PC World | accessdate = October 25, 2011}}</ref>

In February 2013, Lofgren became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131025054356/http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130 |archivedate=October 25, 2013 |title=Reps.
