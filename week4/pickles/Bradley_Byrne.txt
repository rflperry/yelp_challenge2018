As a member of the Alabama Board of Education, the record clearly shows that I fought to ensure the teaching of [[creationism]] in our school text books. Those who attack me have distorted, twisted and misrepresented my comments and are spewing utter lies to the people of this state."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20004740-503544.html?tag=contentMain;contentBody | work=CBS News | title=Alabama Gov.

He later voted with the Board to support a compromise that said, "Explanations of the origin of life and major groups of plants and animals, including humans, shall be treated as theory and not as fact.

Byrne faced Dean Young in the runoff election who received the support of Tea Party voters. After the runoff, Young refused to endorse Byrne which led to rumors of a rift within the Republican Party. But Byrne subsequently gained the endorsement of Alabama Patriots, a Tea Party affiliated organization.<ref>{{cite news |first=Brendan |last=Kirby |title=Tea party group backs Byrne for Congress, disputes notion of rift in GOP |url=http://blog.al.com/live/2013/11/tea_party_group_back_byrne_for.html |newspaper=[[Mobile Press-Register]] |publisher=Alabama Media Group |date=November 12, 2013 |accessdate=November 12, 2013 }}</ref> Byrne won the Republican nomination for the congressional seat and faced Democratic Party nominee Burton LeFlore on December 17, 2013.<ref name=sawyer2013/><ref name="wapo131217">{{cite news |first=Sean |last=Sullivan |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |location=[[Washington, DC]] |title=Republican Bradley Byrne wins Alabama special election |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/12/17/republican-bradley-byrne-wins-alabama-special-election/ |date=December 17, 2013 |accessdate=December 18, 2013}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Byrne supported the [[Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 3973; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[United States Department of Justice]] to report to the [[United States Congress]] whenever any [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]] refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason.<ref name=3973cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3973 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45177|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=11 March 2014}}</ref> In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.<ref name=HtargetsObamalawEnf>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House targets Obama's law enforcement|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/government-oversight/200167-house-to-attack-obamas-non-enforcement-next-week|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=7 March 2014}}</ref> Byrne spoke out in favor of the bill saying, "the Obama Administration has been open and honest about one thing in particular: they have no problem making an end-run around Congress to achieve through administrative means what they cannot legislatively. Placing political convenience above the United States Constitution goes against everything the Founding Fathers intended, and it's time we put a stop to this practice."<ref name=ALpolRep>{{cite news|last=Moseley|first=Brandon|title=Byrne Co-Sponsors Act to Stop Selective Enforcement of the Law By Obama|url=http://alreporter.com/in-case-you-missed-it-2/5814-byrne-co-sponsors-act-to-stop-selective-enforcement-of-the-law-by-obama.html|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=Alabama Political Reporter|date=12 February 2014}}</ref>
