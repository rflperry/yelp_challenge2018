'''Rodney Leland Blum''' (born April 26, 1955) is an American politician who was elected to serve [[Iowa's 1st congressional district]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2014]]. He will take office on January 3, 2015.

==Career==
Blum attended [[Loras College]] where he earned a degree in finance, and the [[University of Dubuque]] where he earned a master’s degree in business administration. A businessman, Blum is a former CEO of Eagle Point Software (1990&ndash;2000) and owner of Digital Canal, a software company, since 2000.<ref>http://www.desmoinesregister.com/story/news/politics/2014/05/09/iowa-election-rod-blum-bio-issues/8924985/</ref><ref name="iowarepub">http://theiowarepublican.com/2011/rod-blum-announces-campaign-for-congress-in-1st-cd/</ref>

==Personal life==
Blum, the son of a [[World War II]] veteran, was born and raised in Dubuque. He resides there with his wife, Karen and five children.<ref>http://votesmart.org/candidate/biography/135714</ref> He is an [[Episcopal]] Christian.<ref name="iowarepub" />

==Controversy==
Blum was listed in the bankruptcy filing of professional hockey player [[Jack Johnson (ice hockey)]]. Johnson, who was to be paid $5 million in salary from the [[Columbus Blue Jackets]] during the 2014-15 [[National Hockey League]] season, filed for federal bankruptcy on October 7, 2014, claiming assets of less than $50,000 and debts of more than $10 million. On November 20, 2014, ''[[The Columbus Dispatch]]'' reported that Blum made a $2 million loan to Johnson's family on March 10, 2011, at an interest rate of 12 percent. Blum sued Johnson within a month of the loan being made, and Johnson signed a settlement that allowed Blum to garnish 25 percent of Johnson's salary over much of the past two seasons to repay the debt.<ref>http://bluejacketsxtra.dispatch.com/content/stories/2014/11/20/blind-sided.html</ref>

The newspaper reported Blum's loan was one of several taken out by Johnson's parents, relying on Johnson's future earnings, to pay for an expensive house in [[Manhattan Beach, California]], as well as luxury cars and travel. Several loans, as well as the mortgage on the California house, went into default.

A spokesman for Blum provided a written statement on November 20, 2014, to the Radio Iowa news network that "this is a difficult time for the Johnson family, and out of respect for their privacy Mr. Blum will not be discussing their private financial situation as the legal process takes its course.".<ref>http://www.radioiowa.com/2014/11/20/congressman-elect-blum-listed-in-bankruptcy-filing-loaned-hockey-stars-family-2-million/</ref>
