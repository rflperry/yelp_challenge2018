In 2008, incumbent Republican State Senator [[Fred Smith (North Carolina politician)|Fred Smith]] decided to retire in order to run for [[Governor of North Carolina]]. Rouzer decided to run and defeated Nena Reeves in the Republican primary 68%-32%.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=435768</ref> In the general election, he defeated Kay Carroll 52% – 48%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=435766]</ref> In 2010, he won re-election with 70% of the vote.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=646259]</ref>

==2012 congressional election==
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in North Carolina, 2012#District 7}}
After Republican-controlled redistricting, he decided to give up his state senate seat to run in the newly redrawn [[North Carolina's 7th congressional district]] and challenge incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman [[Mike McIntyre]]. His home in Johnston County had been drawn into the district; it had previously been in the [[North Carolina's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]].

In the Republican primary, Rouzer defeated both 2010 nominee [[Ilario Pantano]] and Randy Crow, but won just four of the district's twelve counties: Johnston (82%), Sampson (49%), Lenoir (43%), and Hoke (38%).<ref>[http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/36596/80787/en/md.html?cid=201020007 2012 primary results]</ref><ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=740235 2012 primary results]</ref>  However, his margin in Johnston County, the second-largest county in the reconfigured district, was enough for him to win.

The redrawn 7th is much more conservative and Republican than its predecessor. ''[[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]]'' rates the election as ''leans Republican''.<ref>[http://atr.rollcall.com/north-carolina-gop-nominee-attacks-mike-mcintyre-in-7th-district ''Roll Call'' rating]</ref>

After an official tabulation showed that Rouzer had lost the election to McIntyre by 655 votes, Rouzer asked for a recount on November 21, 2012. After the recount, Rouzer conceded the race to McIntyre on November 28.  It was the closest House race in the country. [[Mitt Romney]] carried the district with 56 percent of the vote.

==2014 congressional election==
Rouzer ran for the 7th district again in 2014. McIntyre retired rather than face a rematch.  Most pundits believed that with McIntyre's retirement, the seat would be an easy GOP pickup.  Even before his near-miss in 2012, the 7th had been trending Republican for some time.

Rouzer won the general election with almost 60% of the vote.  When he takes office in January of 2015, he will be only the second Republican to represent a significant portion of eastern North Carolina in the House since [[Reconstruction era in the United States|Reconstruction]].
