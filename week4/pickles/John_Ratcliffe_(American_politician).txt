==2014 congressional election==
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2014#District 4}}
Ratcliffe decided to run in the Republican primary against 17-term incumbent Congressman [[Ralph Hall]] of [[Texas's 4th congressional district]]. At 91 years old, Hall was the oldest member of Congress and the oldest person ever to serve in the House of Representatives. The ''[[Dallas Morning News]]'' wrote that Ratcliffe was Hall's "most serious political challenge in years."<ref>{{cite web|last=Gillman |first=Todd|url=http://trailblazersblog.dallasnews.com/2013/12/ex-us-attorney-john-ratcliffe-files-against-ralph-hall-2.html/ |title=Ex-US Attorney John Ratcliffe files against Ralph Hall |publisher=Dallas Morning News|date=December 9, 2013 |accessdate=December 9, 2013}}</ref> In a primary where Hall had begun to look increasingly vulnerable, Ratcliffe received the endorsement of the ''Dallas Morning News'' which applauded Hall's long record of public service but cited Ratcliffe's "impressive credentials" and the need for "new ideas and fresh energy."<ref>{{cite news|title=Editorial: We recommend Ratcliffe in the 4th Congressional District’s GOP primary|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/opinion/editorials/20140122-editorial-we-recommend-ratcliffe-in-the-4th-congressional-districts-gop-primary.ece|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=Dallas Morning News|date=2014-01-22}}</ref>

In the March 4 primary, Ratcliffe finished second with 29 percent of the vote, behind Hall's 45 percent.  However, since Hall came up short of a majority, a runoff was forced on May 27. Ratcliffe was subsequently endorsed by the [[Tea Party Express]], the [[Senate Conservatives Fund]], and [[Club for Growth|Club For Growth]]. Hall was endorsed by the [[National Rifle Association]], former Congressman [[Ron Paul]], congresswoman [[Michele Bachmann]], and former [[Governor of Arkansas|Arkansas governor]] [[Mike Huckabee]].<ref>{{cite web|last=DelReal |first=Jose |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/05/ralph-hall-loses-texas-gop-runoff-107144.html |title=Ralph Hall loses Texas GOP runoff |publisher=Politico |date=May 27, 2014 |accessdate=May 28, 2014}}</ref>

In the May 27 runoff, Ratcliffe defeated Hall with 53 percent of the vote to Hall's 47 percent.  Ratcliffe won 11 of the district's 18 counties, including the four largest (Grayson, Rockwall, Hunt and Lamar).

Although it is very rare in any event for a primary challenger to defeat a sitting congressman, Ratcliffe's victory was historic as it marked the first time that a sitting Republican congressman in Texas had been ousted in a primary.  Incumbents had previously been successful in all 257 attempts.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kecseg |first=Ross |url=http://www.empowertexans.com/features/ralph-hall-makes-history-will-texans-take-notice/ |title=Ralph Hall Makes History…Will Texans Take Notice? |publisher=Empower Texans |date=May 29, 2014 |accessdate=May 29, 2014}}</ref>  Hall's defeat was also the first by an incumbent member of Congress in the 2014 election cycle.  Ratcliffe was unopposed in the November 4th general election and will be sworn in as a member of the 114th United States Congress in January, 2015. He will be just the fifth person to represent the district since its formation in 1903.
