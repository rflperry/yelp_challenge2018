==Early life, education and career==
Connolly graduated from Maryknoll College in Illinois with a B.A. in Literature in 1971, and completed a [[Master of Public Administration]] from Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]] in 1979.

Connolly worked from 1979 through 1989 with the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], where he managed committee oversight of international economic issues, international narcotics control, and United Nations and Middle East policies, and published reports on U.S. policy in [[El Salvador]], Central America, Israel and the [[Persian Gulf]] region.<ref name="Meet Gerry">{{cite web|url=http://www.gerryconnolly.com/content/meet-gerry|title=Meet Gerry|publisher=|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref> From 1989 through 1997 he was Vice President of the Washington Office of [[SRI International]]. He was also Director of Community Relations for [[Leidos|SAIC (Science Applications International Corporation)]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=95078|title=Representative Gerald E. 'Gerry' Connolly (VA)|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref>

In local politics, Gerry served on the Fairfax Government Reorganization Commission from 1992 through 1993. In 1995 he was elected Providence District Supervisor, serving for nine years.

== Fairfax County Board of Supervisors ==
Connolly's career as a public official began on March 28, 1995 when he was elected Providence District Supervisor on the [[Fairfax County Board of Supervisors]]. He was reelected to a four-year term on the board in November of that same year. Connolly ran unopposed for re-election in November 1999. In 2003, he was elected Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and was reelected in 2007.

As Chairman of the ten-member board, Connolly balanced a $4.5 billion budget and managed a county that, based on size, would make it the nation's thirteenth largest city, twelfth largest school district, and sixth largest office market. He served as Chairman of the County's Legislative Committee and Vice-Chair of the Economic Advisory Committee. Connolly also served as Chairman of the Board of the [[Northern Virginia Transportation Commission]] (NVTC), Chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Commission (NVRC), and was chairman of the Board of the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] (MWCOG). He also chaired the region's Emergency Preparedness Taskforce and represented Fairfax County on the Board of the Virginia Association of Counties (VaCo), where he also served as president.

=== Abortion ===
Connolly is [[Pro-Choice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/pro-choice-voter-guide/race/va-11.html |title=Virginia District 11 :: NARAL Pro-Choice America |publisher=Prochoiceamerica.org |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> He voted against the [[Stupak Amendment]] to the Affordable Care Act, which placed stringent limits on health insurance companies offering abortion services.

=== Civil liberties ===
Connolly has voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] regarding funding the [[US Armed Forces]], including the paychecks delivered to soldiers but also includes a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain anyone "who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners", and anyone who commits a "belligerent act" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, "without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization of Use of Military Force." The law would not grant new powers to the President but it does codify federal court rulings on this issue and the detainment of unlawful combatants until hostilities are over is in accordance to the Geneva Conventions.<ref>{{cite web|author=By |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>112th Congress, 1st Session, H1540CR.HSE: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012."] pp. 265-266.</ref>

=== Health care ===
{{see also|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
In 2009, Connolly was an early supporter of the Democratic health care plan, which ultimately became the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act]], as well as the [[public health insurance option]]; saying at a live chat with constituents in September to a woman from Washington, D.C. that "One of my principles for health care reform is that it increases the choices you have. By setting up a health insurance exchange, we can give your family more insurance choices, hopefully including one that your daughter's doctor chooses to accept". Connolly voted against the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]],<ref name="LiveChatTranscript">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/09/15/DI2009091502448.html|title=Washington Post – Rep.

=== Syria ===

==Political campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2008#District 11}}
Connolly scored a 24 point victory over his closest opponent former Congresswoman [[Leslie L. Byrne]] in the 2008 Democratic Primary. Connolly then defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Keith Fimian]] by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent [[Thomas M. Davis|Tom Davis]].<ref name="CQPolitics">{{cite news|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-VA-11|title=CQ Politics – District Detail: VA-11|publisher=CQ Politics|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref>  The Independent Green Party candidate on the ballot was Joseph P. Oddo.

===2010===
{{main|Virginia's 11th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged again by Fimian in 2010.  Also running were Libertarian David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Connolly barely survived by fewer than a thousand votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fimian will concede defeat to Connolly in 11th district |first=Ben |last=Pershing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/11/fimian_will_concede_defeat_to.html }}</ref>

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2012#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged by Republican nominee Chris Perkins, Green nominee Joe Galdo and independent candidates Peter Marchetti, Chris DeCarlo and Mark Gibson. He received 61% of the vote.  Connolly was significantly aided by redistricting.  The old 11th had been reckoned as a swing district, though Davis had held it without serious difficulty due to his popularity in the area.  However, redistricting made the 11th significantly more Democratic than its predecessor.  [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 11th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, but would have carried it with 61 percent of the vote under the new lines--making it one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South.

===2014===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014#District 11}}

Gerry Connolly is facing Republican Suzanne Scholte, Green Joe Galdo, and Libertarian Marc Harrold in his reelection bid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 11th Congressional District elections, 2014|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Virginia%27s_11th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=www.ballotpedia.org|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

He served as Chairman of the County's Legislative Committee and Vice-Chair of the Economic Advisory Committee. Connolly also served as Chairman of the Board of the [[Northern Virginia Transportation Commission]] (NVTC), Chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Commission (NVRC), and was chairman of the Board of the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] (MWCOG).

==Political positions==

=== Abortion ===
Connolly is [[Pro-Choice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/pro-choice-voter-guide/race/va-11.html |title=Virginia District 11 :: NARAL Pro-Choice America |publisher=Prochoiceamerica.org |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> He voted against the [[Stupak Amendment]] to the Affordable Care Act, which placed stringent limits on health insurance companies offering abortion services. During the budget amendments process in 2011, he voted against an amendment that would have prevented taxpayer funds from going to [[Planned Parenthood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/rep_bios.php?rep_id=50067187&category=views&id=20100506104040 |title=Gerry Connolly – Abortion |publisher=Thepoliticalguide.com |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref>

=== Civil liberties ===
Connolly has voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] regarding funding the [[US Armed Forces]], including the paychecks delivered to soldiers but also includes a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain anyone "who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners", and anyone who commits a "belligerent act" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, "without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization of Use of Military Force." The law would not grant new powers to the President but it does codify federal court rulings on this issue and the detainment of unlawful combatants until hostilities are over is in accordance to the Geneva Conventions.<ref>{{cite web|author=By |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>112th Congress, 1st Session, H1540CR.HSE: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012."] pp. 265-266.</ref>

=== Gay Rights ===
Connolly supports gay rights, having campaigned against the [[Marshall-Newman Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Virginia|Virginia Constitution]], which banned all gay unions from being performed or recognized in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Gerry+Connolly/articles/2/House+candidates+diverge+gay+issues+Va |title=U.S. House candidates diverge on gay issues in Va. – Gerry Connolly |publisher=Zimbio |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> In Congress, he voted in favor of repealing the contentious "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law that prohibited gays from serving openly in the military, and has co-sponsored a few bills that would repeal portions of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/rep_bios.php?rep_id=50067187&category=views&id=20100506104041 |title=Gerry Connolly – Gay Marriage |publisher=Thepoliticalguide.com |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> In June of 2013, Connolly posed for a picture with the NO H8 Campaign.

=== Guns ===
While on the Board of Supervisors for Fairfax County, Connolly sponsored an ordinance that would have made it illegal to transport a loaded shotgun in the back of one's car.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bluevirginia.us/showDiary.do?diaryId=4951|title=Blue Virginia:: Rep.

=== Health care ===
{{see also|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
In 2009, Connolly was an early supporter of the Democratic health care plan, which ultimately became the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act]], as well as the [[public health insurance option]]; saying at a live chat with constituents in September to a woman from Washington, D.C. that "One of my principles for health care reform is that it increases the choices you have. By setting up a health insurance exchange, we can give your family more insurance choices, hopefully including one that your daughter's doctor chooses to accept". Connolly voted against the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]],<ref name="LiveChatTranscript">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/09/15/DI2009091502448.html|title=Washington Post – Rep. Gerald Connolly On Health Reform|date=September 24, 2009|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=February 18, 2010}}</ref> and later for the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act]] in March 2010.

Connolly cited deficit reduction in explaining his health care vote.<ref name="aol">{{cite news|url=http://www.aolnews.com/politics/article/rep-gerry-connolly-in-trouble-after-health-care-vote/19423395|title=Congressman in Trouble After Health Care Vote|last=Stone|first=Andrea|date=April 4, 2010|publisher=AOL News|accessdate=April 5, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author=Jessica Banthin&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;Sarah Masi |url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44176 |title=CBO’s Estimate of the Net Budgetary Impact of the Affordable Care Act’s Health Insurance Coverage Provisions Has Not Changed Much Over Time - CBO |publisher=Cbo.gov |date=2013-05-14 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref>

=== Military veterans ===
Connolly was a cosponsor of the Helping Active Duty Deployed Act<ref>Helping Active Duty Deployed Act of 2009</ref> and the Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-1016 |title=H.R. 1016: Veterans Health Care Budget Reform and Transparency Act of 2009 |publisher=GovTrack.us |accessdate=2010-11-05}}</ref>

=== Syria ===
Connolly was a supporter of a [[Syrian civil war|Military intervention in Syria]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-05/politics/41801169_1_syria-majority-leader-eric-cantor-weapons | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Nakamura | title=Rep.

==Political campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2008#District 11}}
Connolly scored a 24 point victory over his closest opponent former Congresswoman [[Leslie L. Byrne]] in the 2008 Democratic Primary. Connolly then defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Keith Fimian]] by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent [[Thomas M. Davis|Tom Davis]].<ref name="CQPolitics">{{cite news|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-VA-11|title=CQ Politics – District Detail: VA-11|publisher=CQ Politics|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref>  The Independent Green Party candidate on the ballot was Joseph P. Oddo.

===2010===
{{main|Virginia's 11th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged again by Fimian in 2010.  Also running were Libertarian David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Connolly barely survived by fewer than a thousand votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fimian will concede defeat to Connolly in 11th district |first=Ben |last=Pershing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/11/fimian_will_concede_defeat_to.html }}</ref>

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2012#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged by Republican nominee Chris Perkins, Green nominee Joe Galdo and independent candidates Peter Marchetti, Chris DeCarlo and Mark Gibson. He received 61% of the vote.  Connolly was significantly aided by redistricting.  The old 11th had been reckoned as a swing district, though Davis had held it without serious difficulty due to his popularity in the area.  However, redistricting made the 11th significantly more Democratic than its predecessor.  [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 11th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, but would have carried it with 61 percent of the vote under the new lines--making it one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South.

===2014===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014#District 11}}

Gerry Connolly is facing Republican Suzanne Scholte, Green Joe Galdo, and Libertarian Marc Harrold in his reelection bid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 11th Congressional District elections, 2014|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Virginia%27s_11th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=www.ballotpedia.org|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

=== Civil liberties ===
Connolly has voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] regarding funding the [[US Armed Forces]], including the paychecks delivered to soldiers but also includes a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain anyone "who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners", and anyone who commits a "belligerent act" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, "without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization of Use of Military Force." The law would not grant new powers to the President but it does codify federal court rulings on this issue and the detainment of unlawful combatants until hostilities are over is in accordance to the Geneva Conventions.<ref>{{cite web|author=By |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>112th Congress, 1st Session, H1540CR.HSE: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012."] pp. 265-266.</ref>

Connolly supports gay rights, having campaigned against the [[Marshall-Newman Amendment]] to the [[Constitution of Virginia|Virginia Constitution]], which banned all gay unions from being performed or recognized in Virginia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.zimbio.com/Gerry+Connolly/articles/2/House+candidates+diverge+gay+issues+Va |title=U.S. House candidates diverge on gay issues in Va. – Gerry Connolly |publisher=Zimbio |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> In Congress, he voted in favor of repealing the contentious "Don't Ask, Don't Tell" law that prohibited gays from serving openly in the military, and has co-sponsored a few bills that would repeal portions of the Federal Defense of Marriage Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/rep_bios.php?rep_id=50067187&category=views&id=20100506104041 |title=Gerry Connolly – Gay Marriage |publisher=Thepoliticalguide.com |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> In June of 2013, Connolly posed for a picture with the NO H8 Campaign.

=== Health care ===
{{see also|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
In 2009, Connolly was an early supporter of the Democratic health care plan, which ultimately became the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act]], as well as the [[public health insurance option]]; saying at a live chat with constituents in September to a woman from Washington, D.C. that "One of my principles for health care reform is that it increases the choices you have. By setting up a health insurance exchange, we can give your family more insurance choices, hopefully including one that your daughter's doctor chooses to accept". Connolly voted against the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]],<ref name="LiveChatTranscript">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/09/15/DI2009091502448.html|title=Washington Post – Rep.

=== Syria ===
Connolly was a supporter of a [[Syrian civil war|Military intervention in Syria]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://articles.washingtonpost.com/2013-09-05/politics/41801169_1_syria-majority-leader-eric-cantor-weapons | work=The Washington Post | first=David | last=Nakamura | title=Rep.

==Political campaigns==

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2008#District 11}}
Connolly scored a 24 point victory over his closest opponent former Congresswoman [[Leslie L. Byrne]] in the 2008 Democratic Primary. Connolly then defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Keith Fimian]] by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent [[Thomas M. Davis|Tom Davis]].<ref name="CQPolitics">{{cite news|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-VA-11|title=CQ Politics – District Detail: VA-11|publisher=CQ Politics|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref>  The Independent Green Party candidate on the ballot was Joseph P. Oddo.

===2010===
{{main|Virginia's 11th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged again by Fimian in 2010.  Also running were Libertarian David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Connolly barely survived by fewer than a thousand votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fimian will concede defeat to Connolly in 11th district |first=Ben |last=Pershing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/11/fimian_will_concede_defeat_to.html }}</ref>

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2012#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged by Republican nominee Chris Perkins, Green nominee Joe Galdo and independent candidates Peter Marchetti, Chris DeCarlo and Mark Gibson. He received 61% of the vote.  Connolly was significantly aided by redistricting.  The old 11th had been reckoned as a swing district, though Davis had held it without serious difficulty due to his popularity in the area.  However, redistricting made the 11th significantly more Democratic than its predecessor.  [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 11th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, but would have carried it with 61 percent of the vote under the new lines--making it one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South.

===2014===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014#District 11}}

Gerry Connolly is facing Republican Suzanne Scholte, Green Joe Galdo, and Libertarian Marc Harrold in his reelection bid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 11th Congressional District elections, 2014|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Virginia%27s_11th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=www.ballotpedia.org|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>

==Early life, education and career==
Connolly graduated from Maryknoll College in Illinois with a B.A. in Literature in 1971, and completed a [[Master of Public Administration]] from Harvard's [[Kennedy School of Government]] in 1979.

Connolly worked from 1979 through 1989 with the [[United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations]], where he managed committee oversight of international economic issues, international narcotics control, and United Nations and Middle East policies, and published reports on U.S. policy in [[El Salvador]], Central America, Israel and the [[Persian Gulf]] region.<ref name="Meet Gerry">{{cite web|url=http://www.gerryconnolly.com/content/meet-gerry|title=Meet Gerry|publisher=|accessdate=September 26, 2014}}</ref> From 1989 through 1997 he was Vice President of the Washington Office of [[SRI International]].

In local politics, Gerry served on the Fairfax Government Reorganization Commission from 1992 through 1993. In 1995 he was elected Providence District Supervisor, serving for nine years.

== Fairfax County Board of Supervisors ==
Connolly's career as a public official began on March 28, 1995 when he was elected Providence District Supervisor on the [[Fairfax County Board of Supervisors]]. He was reelected to a four-year term on the board in November of that same year. Connolly ran unopposed for re-election in November 1999. In 2003, he was elected Chairman of the Fairfax County Board of Supervisors and was reelected in 2007.

As Chairman of the ten-member board, Connolly balanced a $4.5 billion budget and managed a county that, based on size, would make it the nation's thirteenth largest city, twelfth largest school district, and sixth largest office market. He served as Chairman of the County's Legislative Committee and Vice-Chair of the Economic Advisory Committee. Connolly also served as Chairman of the Board of the [[Northern Virginia Transportation Commission]] (NVTC), Chairman of the Northern Virginia Regional Commission (NVRC), and was chairman of the Board of the [[Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments]] (MWCOG). He also chaired the region's Emergency Preparedness Taskforce and represented Fairfax County on the Board of the Virginia Association of Counties (VaCo), where he also served as president.

==Political positions==

=== Abortion ===
Connolly is [[Pro-Choice]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/elections/pro-choice-voter-guide/race/va-11.html |title=Virginia District 11 :: NARAL Pro-Choice America |publisher=Prochoiceamerica.org |accessdate=October 19, 2011}}</ref> He voted against the [[Stupak Amendment]] to the Affordable Care Act, which placed stringent limits on health insurance companies offering abortion services.

=== Civil liberties ===
Connolly has voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] regarding funding the [[US Armed Forces]], including the paychecks delivered to soldiers but also includes a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to detain anyone "who was part of or substantially supported al-Qaeda, the Taliban, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners", and anyone who commits a "belligerent act" against the United States or its coalition allies in aid of such enemy forces, under the law of war, "without trial, until the end of the hostilities authorized by the Authorization of Use of Military Force." The law would not grant new powers to the President but it does codify federal court rulings on this issue and the detainment of unlawful combatants until hostilities are over is in accordance to the Geneva Conventions.<ref>{{cite web|author=By |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362 |title=NDAA Bill: How Did Your Congress Member Vote? |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date=2011-12-16 |accessdate=2014-08-13}}</ref><ref>112th Congress, 1st Session, H1540CR.HSE: [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/BILLS-112hr1540enr/pdf/BILLS-112hr1540enr.pdf "National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012."] pp. 265-266.</ref>

=== Health care ===
{{see also|Health care reform debate in the United States}}
In 2009, Connolly was an early supporter of the Democratic health care plan, which ultimately became the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act]], as well as the [[public health insurance option]]; saying at a live chat with constituents in September to a woman from Washington, D.C. that "One of my principles for health care reform is that it increases the choices you have. By setting up a health insurance exchange, we can give your family more insurance choices, hopefully including one that your daughter's doctor chooses to accept". Connolly voted against the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]],<ref name="LiveChatTranscript">{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/discussion/2009/09/15/DI2009091502448.html|title=Washington Post – Rep.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2008#District 11}}
Connolly scored a 24 point victory over his closest opponent former Congresswoman [[Leslie L. Byrne]] in the 2008 Democratic Primary. Connolly then defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Keith Fimian]] by more than ten points for the open seat held by Republican incumbent [[Thomas M. Davis|Tom Davis]].<ref name="CQPolitics">{{cite news|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/wmspage.cfm?docID=district-VA-11|title=CQ Politics – District Detail: VA-11|publisher=CQ Politics|accessdate=February 20, 2010}}</ref>  The Independent Green Party candidate on the ballot was Joseph P. Oddo.

===2010===
{{main|Virginia's 11th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged again by Fimian in 2010.  Also running were Libertarian David L. Dotson, Independent Green David William Gillis, Jr., and Independent Christopher F. DeCarlo. Connolly barely survived by fewer than a thousand votes.<ref>{{cite news |title=Fimian will concede defeat to Connolly in 11th district |first=Ben |last=Pershing |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=November 8, 2010 |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/virginiapolitics/2010/11/fimian_will_concede_defeat_to.html }}</ref>

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2012#District 11}}
Connolly was challenged by Republican nominee Chris Perkins, Green nominee Joe Galdo and independent candidates Peter Marchetti, Chris DeCarlo and Mark Gibson. He received 61% of the vote.  Connolly was significantly aided by redistricting.  The old 11th had been reckoned as a swing district, though Davis had held it without serious difficulty due to his popularity in the area.  However, redistricting made the 11th significantly more Democratic than its predecessor.  [[Barack Obama]] carried the old 11th with 57 percent of the vote in 2008, but would have carried it with 61 percent of the vote under the new lines--making it one of the most Democratic white-majority districts in the South.

===2014===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2014#District 11}}

Gerry Connolly is facing Republican Suzanne Scholte, Green Joe Galdo, and Libertarian Marc Harrold in his reelection bid.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia's 11th Congressional District elections, 2014|url=http://ballotpedia.org/Virginia%27s_11th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website=www.ballotpedia.org|accessdate=October 20, 2014}}</ref>
