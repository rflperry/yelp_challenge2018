'''Lois Capps''' (born January 10, 1938) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|24}}, serving in Congress since 1998. She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Her current district includes all of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]], [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] and a portion of [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].

Capps serves on the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], where she is a member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Health. She is a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]].

==Background==
Born Lois Ragnhild Grimsrud in [[Ladysmith, Wisconsin]], the daughter of Solveig Magdalene (née Gullixson) and Rev. Jurgen Milton Grimsrud, her father was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister. Both of her parent's families came from [[Norway]].<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/capps.htm</ref> She has lived in Santa Barbara since 1964. She was educated at [[Pacific Lutheran University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[nursing]]. She earned a master's degree in religion at [[Yale University]] and a master's degree in education at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

In 1960, while at Yale, she married [[Walter Capps]], a divinity student at Yale who later became a prominent religious studies professor at UCSB; they eventually had three children. Walter died in 1997 and their eldest daughter Lisa died in 2000. Lois Capps worked for 20 years as a nurse and health advocate for the Santa Barbara public schools and also taught early childhood education part-time at [[Santa Barbara City College]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Walter Capps was elected to Congress in 1996 in a rematch of his 1994 race against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Andrea Seastrand]]. However, he died of a heart attack on October 28, 1997, only nine months into his term. His widow won the then-[[California's 22nd congressional district|22nd District]] seat by defeating Republican [[Tom J. Bordonaro, Jr.|Tom Bordonaro]] in a [[special election]] on March 10, 1998. She was sworn into the 105th Congress on March 17. Lois Capps successfully defended her seat against Bordonaro in a general election later that year, and commenced her first full term in office. Capps is one of two sitting representatives to be elected to their seats following the deaths of their husbands, along with [[Doris Matsui]] (D-[[California|CA]]).

In 2000, Capps retained the 22nd district seat, defeating Republican Mike Stoker with 53% of the vote. She was the first Democrat to hold the district for more than one term in over 50 years (the district, known as the 11th from its formation in 1943 until 1953, the 13th from 1953 to 1975 and the 19th from 1975 to 1993, had been held by Republicans from 1947 until Walter Capps was sworn in 1997).

Redistricting made Capps somewhat safer, and she was reelected without serious opposition in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. However, her district was redrawn in the 2010 redistricting; in the 2012 election, Capps ran in {{ushr|CA|24}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cappsforcongress.com/news/capps-running-for-re-election-in-new-central-coast-congressional-district |title=Capps Running for Re-Election in New Central Coast Congressional District |date=July 29, 2011 |publisher=Re-Elect Lois Capps |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref> David Wasserman, House editor of ''[[The Cook Political Report]]'', predicted that this would be a more difficult race, and local Republicans confirmed that Capps is one of their top targets in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=New district maps threaten Republicans' seats in Congress |author=Jean Merl and Richard Simon |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-congress-republicans-20111212,0,3290683.story |newspaper=LA Times |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> This new district still includes [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Luis Obispo]], but was redrawn to include new inland areas as well.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map</ref> Capps eventually beat her opponent, [[Abel Maldonado]], with 54.8% of votes.<ref>http://www.theadobepress.com/articles/2012/11/09/news/news55.txt</ref>

In 2014, Capps ran against Republican [[Christopher Mitchum|Chris Mitchum]], an actor, screenwriter, and businessman. Mitchum is the son of legendary film star [[Robert Mitchum]].

==Tenure==
Capps has been described as a "solid liberal".

In 2011, Capps voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362</ref>

Capps introduced the [[National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013]] which would, if enacted, authorize the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] to support, fund, and coordinate data from research on rare pediatric diseases.

;Foreign policy
In 2012, she was the only member of the House to vote "no" on Resolution 556 to condemn the government of Iran for its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of [[Youcef Nadarkhani]] of the charge of apostasy.

;Environmental policy
Capps has a major interest in environmental policy. In 2004, the House passed her piece of legislation to prohibit "comprehensive inventory of oil and gas resources beneath the outer continental shelf." She was also a vocal opponent of drilling for oil in the [[Los Padres National Forest]] and offshore drilling off the coast of California.<ref name="NJ Bio"/>

'''Lois Capps''' (born January 10, 1938) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|24}}, serving in Congress since 1998. She is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Her current district includes all of [[San Luis Obispo County, California|San Luis Obispo County]], [[Santa Barbara County, California|Santa Barbara County]] and a portion of [[Ventura County, California|Ventura County]].

Capps serves on the [[U.S. House Committee on Energy and Commerce]], where she is a member of the Energy and Air Quality Subcommittee and the Subcommittee on Health. She is a member of the [[New Democrat Coalition]].

==Background==
Born Lois Ragnhild Grimsrud in [[Ladysmith, Wisconsin]], the daughter of Solveig Magdalene (née Gullixson) and Rev. Jurgen Milton Grimsrud, her father was a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister. Both of her parent's families came from [[Norway]].<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/capps.htm</ref> She has lived in Santa Barbara since 1964. She was educated at [[Pacific Lutheran University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[nursing]]. She earned a master's degree in religion at [[Yale University]] and a master's degree in education at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]].

In 1960, while at Yale, she married [[Walter Capps]], a divinity student at Yale who later became a prominent religious studies professor at UCSB; they eventually had three children. Walter died in 1997 and their eldest daughter Lisa died in 2000. Lois Capps worked for 20 years as a nurse and health advocate for the Santa Barbara public schools and also taught early childhood education part-time at [[Santa Barbara City College]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
Walter Capps was elected to Congress in 1996 in a rematch of his 1994 race against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Andrea Seastrand]]. However, he died of a heart attack on October 28, 1997, only nine months into his term. His widow won the then-[[California's 22nd congressional district|22nd District]] seat by defeating Republican [[Tom J. Bordonaro, Jr.|Tom Bordonaro]] in a [[special election]] on March 10, 1998. She was sworn into the 105th Congress on March 17. Lois Capps successfully defended her seat against Bordonaro in a general election later that year, and commenced her first full term in office. Capps is one of two sitting representatives to be elected to their seats following the deaths of their husbands, along with [[Doris Matsui]] (D-[[California|CA]]).

In 2000, Capps retained the 22nd district seat, defeating Republican Mike Stoker with 53% of the vote. She was the first Democrat to hold the district for more than one term in over 50 years (the district, known as the 11th from its formation in 1943 until 1953, the 13th from 1953 to 1975 and the 19th from 1975 to 1993, had been held by Republicans from 1947 until Walter Capps was sworn in 1997).

Redistricting made Capps somewhat safer, and she was reelected without serious opposition in 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008 and 2010. However, her district was redrawn in the 2010 redistricting; in the 2012 election, Capps ran in {{ushr|CA|24}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cappsforcongress.com/news/capps-running-for-re-election-in-new-central-coast-congressional-district |title=Capps Running for Re-Election in New Central Coast Congressional District |date=July 29, 2011 |publisher=Re-Elect Lois Capps |accessdate=December 20, 2011}}</ref> David Wasserman, House editor of ''[[The Cook Political Report]]'', predicted that this would be a more difficult race, and local Republicans confirmed that Capps is one of their top targets in California.<ref>{{cite news |title=New district maps threaten Republicans' seats in Congress |author=Jean Merl and Richard Simon |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-congress-republicans-20111212,0,3290683.story |newspaper=LA Times |date=December 11, 2011 |accessdate=December 19, 2011}}</ref> This new district still includes [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and [[San Luis Obispo]], but was redrawn to include new inland areas as well.<ref>http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/map</ref> Capps eventually beat her opponent, [[Abel Maldonado]], with 54.8% of votes.<ref>http://www.theadobepress.com/articles/2012/11/09/news/news55.txt</ref>

In 2014, Capps ran against Republican [[Christopher Mitchum|Chris Mitchum]], an actor, screenwriter, and businessman. Mitchum is the son of legendary film star [[Robert Mitchum]].

==Tenure==
Capps has been described as a "solid liberal".

In 2011, Capps voted for the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362</ref>

Capps introduced the [[National Pediatric Research Network Act of 2013]] which would, if enacted, authorize the [[National Institutes of Health|NIH]] to support, fund, and coordinate data from research on rare pediatric diseases.

;Foreign policy
In 2012, she was the only member of the House to vote "no" on Resolution 556 to condemn the government of Iran for its continued persecution, imprisonment, and sentencing of [[Youcef Nadarkhani]] of the charge of apostasy.

;Environmental policy
Capps has a major interest in environmental policy. In 2004, the House passed her piece of legislation to prohibit "comprehensive inventory of oil and gas resources beneath the outer continental shelf." She was also a vocal opponent of drilling for oil in the [[Los Padres National Forest]] and offshore drilling off the coast of California.<ref name="NJ Bio"/>
