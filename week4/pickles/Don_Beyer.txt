Beyer was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Virginia]] in 1989, beating Republican state senator [[Edwina P. Dalton]].  He was re-elected in 1993, beating Republican [[Michael Farris]] 54-46 percent, as Republicans [[George Allen (U.S. politician)|George Allen]] and [[Jim Gilmore]] were elected on the same ballot as [[Governor of Virginia|Governor]] and [[Attorney General of Virginia|Attorney General]], respectively.  Farris's close connection to conservative leaders such as [[Jerry Falwell]] of the [[Moral Majority]], [[Pat Robertson]] of the [[Christian Coalition of America|Christian Coalition]] and [[Phyllis Schlafly]] of the [[Eagle Forum]], as well as his adherence to the [[Quiverfull|Quiverfull movement]]<ref name='farris02007-04-20'>{{cite web|url=http://www.sourcewatch.org/index.php?title=Michael_P._Farris |title=Bio for Mr Farris |accessdate=2007-04-20 |language=American English }}</ref><ref name="farris">{{cite book | title=A Mom Just Like You| last=Farris| first=Vickie| year=2002| publisher=B&H Publishing Group| location=Nashville, TN| isbn=0-8054-2586-1}}</ref> stirred deep-seated feelings about religion and politics.
