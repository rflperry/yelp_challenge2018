After a bitter race that brought to the fore some dissatisfaction over party leadership, Eshoo lost a party vote for the Democrat who will serve as ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

;Human rights
Eshoo is a strong supporter of the [[gay rights]] movement. In 1992 when a [[gay bashing]] mailer was directed at Supervisor Tom Nolan (the first openly gay supervisor in San Mateo and her opponent for her congressional seat) Eshoo stood fast in defending him, his record and years of service.  She opposed the [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.j.res.00106: Marriage Protection Amendment] and the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:H.R.3313: Marriage Protection Act].  Her website says the bill is "discriminatory, singling out for the first time a minority to prevent their interests from being considered by the highest courts in the land."<ref>Anna Eshoo's [http://eshoo.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=229&Itemid=46#National stance on civil rights]</ref>

As one of just two Assyrian members of Congress, Eshoo has worked hard to protect indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] in [[Iraq]] from continuing [[religious persecution]] and political exclusion.

She has voted to increase the annual cap on [[H-1B visa]]s to allow more temporary foreign professionals to work in the United States (especially those with [[Master's Degrees]] or higher).

In her state of California, where as much as 90% of the agricultural workforce is composed of illegal immigrants,<ref>Study by the [http://www.dol.gov/ Department of Labor]</ref> Rep. Eshoo cosponsored H.R. 371, the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-371 Agricultural Jobs Act], which would confer blue card status on illegal immigrants who had worked an agricultural job in the United States for 150 days or more.  This bill never became law.

Other legislation includes:

She authored a bill authorizing electronic signatures and introduced controversial legislation to help alleviate the proliferation of unsolicited email, known as [[E-mail spam|spam]]. The U.S. House of Representatives passed The [[Can Spam|CAN-SPAM]] Act of 2003 (S. 877), which authorizes a “Do Not Spam” list, regulates commercial email, and imposes fines on spammers.

After a bitter race that brought to the fore some dissatisfaction over party leadership, Eshoo lost a party vote for the Democrat who will serve as ranking member of the House Energy and Commerce Committee.

;Human rights
Eshoo is a strong supporter of the [[gay rights]] movement. In 1992 when a [[gay bashing]] mailer was directed at Supervisor Tom Nolan (the first openly gay supervisor in San Mateo and her opponent for her congressional seat) Eshoo stood fast in defending him, his record and years of service.  She opposed the [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.j.res.00106: Marriage Protection Amendment] and the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:H.R.3313: Marriage Protection Act].  Her website says the bill is "discriminatory, singling out for the first time a minority to prevent their interests from being considered by the highest courts in the land."<ref>Anna Eshoo's [http://eshoo.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=229&Itemid=46#National stance on civil rights]</ref>

As one of just two Assyrian members of Congress, Eshoo has worked hard to protect indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] in [[Iraq]] from continuing [[religious persecution]] and political exclusion.  She authored an amendment to H.R. 2601, the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-2601 Foreign Relations Authorization Act], requesting that "special attention should be paid to the welfare of Chaldo-Assyrians and other indigenous Christians in Iraq."<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/amendment.xpd?session=109&amdt=h483 Amendment 483 to Hr. 2601]</ref>

Rep. Eshoo has been a strong supporter of the Congressional resolution recognizing the [[Armenian Genocide]].  She also supports closer ties between [[Armenia]] and the U.S.

Rep. Eshoo has fought strongly against certain provisions of the [[Patriot Act]], particularly Section 215 (Access to Business Records), which gives federal investigators the right to obtain any tangible business record without obtaining a subpoena.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Rep. Eshoo also introduced "[[Kevin's law|Kevin's Law]]," which would have given the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat.

As an Assyrian and Armenian American, Rep. Eshoo is co-chair and co-founder of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus. She also serves on the Board of Advisors of [http://www.religionandpolicy.org THE INSTITUTE on Religion and Public Policy], a freedom of religion organization.

;Immigration
Rep. Eshoo has worked to create a legal "pathway to citizenship" for [[foreign worker]]s of all kinds, from doctors and computer programmers to migrant farm workers.  She has voted to increase the annual cap on [[H-1B visa]]s to allow more temporary foreign professionals to work in the United States (especially those with [[Master's Degrees]] or higher).

In her state of California, where as much as 90% of the agricultural workforce is composed of illegal immigrants,<ref>Study by the [http://www.dol.gov/ Department of Labor]</ref> Rep. Eshoo cosponsored H.R. 371, the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-371 Agricultural Jobs Act], which would confer blue card status on illegal immigrants who had worked an agricultural job in the United States for 150 days or more.  This bill never became law.

Other legislation includes:
* [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1275 H.R. 1275, American Dream Act], cosponsor - Allows states to provide tuition to students that are illegal immigrants, providing they meet certain criteria.
* [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-1379 H.R. 1379, Citizen Promotion Act], cosponsor - Assists lawfully admitted aliens in becoming permanent citizens of the United States.
* [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-2221 H.R. 2221, Uniting American Families Act], cosponsor - Amends the Immigration and Nationality Act to include "or permanent partner" where spouse occurs.

;Technology
In November 2005, Rep. Eshoo led the [[House Democratic Caucus]] in introducing the "Innovation Agenda." Representative Eshoo developed this comprehensive policy in conjunction with House Democratic Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]] and others after extensive consultation with [[Silicon Valley]] and tech leaders around the country, [[venture capitalists]], and scholars.

She authored a bill authorizing electronic signatures and introduced controversial legislation to help alleviate the proliferation of unsolicited email, known as [[E-mail spam|spam]]. The U.S. House of Representatives passed The [[Can Spam|CAN-SPAM]] Act of 2003 (S. 877), which authorizes a “Do Not Spam” list, regulates commercial email, and imposes fines on spammers. Eshoo authored the Consumer Internet Privacy Enhancement Act of 2001 (H.R. 237), created a program to provide discounts to schools and libraries for Internet access, and authored the Computer Donation Incentive Act.

Rep. Eshoo introduced HR 2428, the [[Broadband Conduit Deployment Act]] of 2009.<ref name=hr2428_announce>{{cite web

;Youth
{{BLP unsourced section|date=April 2010}}
Eshoo created student advisory boards in 1993 consisting of youth from her congressional district, who advise her on policies and make recommendations, and are located in Palo Alto, San Mateo and Santa Cruz. The students attend biweekly meetings and choose one topic to focus on each year. Past topics have included health care, the crisis in Darfur, medicine, voter reform, foreign affairs, and the media. Eshoo also hosts a congressional arts competition, which students can apply to win.
