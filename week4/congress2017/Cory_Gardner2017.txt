In October 2014, the ''Denver Post'' endorsed Gardner, writing that "he has emphasized economic and energy issues (and was, for example, an early supporter among Republicans of renewable energy). ... "his past views on same-sex marriage are becoming irrelevant now that the Supreme Court has let appeals court rulings stand and marriage equality appears unstoppable. And contrary to Udall's tedious refrain, Gardner's election would pose no threat to abortion rights."<ref>{{cite news|title=Cory Gardner for U.S. Senate|url=http://www.denverpost.com/ci_26701817/cory-gardner-u-s-senate|accessdate=October 28, 2014|publisher=Denver Post|date=October 10, 2014}}</ref> Former [[Denver Broncos]] quarterback [[John Elway]] endorsed Gardner.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Richardson|first1=Valerie|title=NFL politics: Elway backs Gardner in Colorado as progressives target Denver Broncos fans|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/oct/23/elway-backs-gardner-progressives-aim-broncos-fans|accessdate=October 28, 2014|publisher=Washington Times|date=October 23, 2014}}</ref>
