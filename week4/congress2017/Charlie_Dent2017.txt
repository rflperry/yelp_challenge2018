[[File:Congress1.ogv|thumb|left|Rep. Charles Dent, R-PA, introduces legislation (HR 1254) to ban the ingredients found in synthetic marijuana Dec. 7, 2011, on the House floor. The House passed the legislation Dec. 8, 2011. Video:C-SPAN]]
Dent is a proponent of hydrogen fuel and is one of the four founding members of the House Hydrogen Fuel Cell Caucus. In 2006 he proposed legislation aimed at promoting the rollout of commercial [[hydrogen]] fueling stations.

He has spoken of his vision for the development of a "Hydrogen Highway East", similar to California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]]'s plans for a Hydrogen Highway on the West Coast. Dent is a member of The [[Republican Main Street Partnership]]. In 2007 he was elected to co-chair the [[The Tuesday Group (of moderate Republican congressmen)|Tuesday Group]], a centrist organization of Congressional Republicans.

As a Republican representing a district with Democratic leanings, he sometimes crosses party lines on legislation. In December 2010, Dent was one of fifteen Republican House members to vote in favor of repealing the [[United States military]]'s "[[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]]" ban on [[openly gay]] service members.<ref name=metro_weekly_20101215>Chris Geidner, [http://www.metroweekly.com/poliglot/2010/12/breaking-house-passes-dadt-rep.html House Passes DADT Repeal Bill], ''[[Metro Weekly]]'' (December 15, 2010).</ref><ref name=nytimes_20101215>[http://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/111/house/2/638 House Vote 638 – Repeals 'Don't Ask, Don't Tell'], ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 15, 2010.</ref>

Dent is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]]. In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109%3Ah.r.04411 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160408124737/http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411 |archivedate=2016-04-08 |df= }}</ref>

He voted against Federal intervention in the [[Terri Schiavo case]]. Dent opposed government intervention in a personal matter and has said he would have voted the same way had courts sided with Schiavo's parents.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In April 2010, Dent introduced a resolution urging the [[U.S. State Department]] to issue a [[Certificate of Loss of Nationality]] to [[Anwar al-Awlaki]]. He said al-Awlaki "preaches a culture of hate" and had been a functioning member of al-Qaeda "since before 9/11", and had effectively renounced his citizenship by engaging in treasonous acts.<ref>{{Cite news|author=Levine, Mike|url=http://politics.blogs.foxnews.com/2010/04/22/rep-introduces-resolution-strip-radical-cleric-us-citizenship|title=Rep.

In April 2011, Dent voted in favor of a 2012 budget proposal authored by [[Paul Ryan]] entitled ''[[The Path to Prosperity]]'', which included several controversial changes to both health care and tax policy. Dent said of the bill that, "It's a serious, sober document ... There are some things in there that I think are interesting."<ref>{{Cite news|author1=Miller, Sean J.|author2=D'Aprile, Shane|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/154161-gop-vulnerable-members-cautiously-embrace-ryan-budget|title=Vulnerables offer praise for Ryan plan|work=Ballot Box: The Hill's Campaign Blog|publisher=The Hill|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

In January 2012, Dent co-sponsored the [[Enemy Expatriation Act]] with Senator [[Joe Lieberman]]. The proposal would allow the United States government to strip U.S. citizens of their citizenship without requiring that the citizen have been convicted of a crime.<ref name="ene">[http://www.addictinginfo.org/2012/01/06/new-bill-known-as-enemy-expatriation-act-would-allow-government-to-strip-citizenship-without-conviction/ New Bill Known As Enemy Expatriation Act Would Allow Government To Strip Citizenship Without Conviction], Addictinginfo.org, January 6, 2012.</ref>

At the start of the 112th Congress, Dent received a new position on the coveted House Appropriations Committee, and continues to serve on the House Ethics Committee. In June 2013, Dent decided to co-sponsor the [[Safe Schools Improvement Act]] (SSIA), a bill that would require schools and districts to adopt policies specifically prohibiting [[bullying]] and harassment against all students, including [[LGBT]] young people. Dent is known for his efforts to promote LGBT equality throughout the nation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://blogs.phillymag.com/gphilly/2013/06/17/pa-congressman-charlie-dent-co-sponsor-lgbt-specific-anti-bullying-bill|title=Pennsylvania Congressman Charlie Dent to co-sponsor LGBT-specific anti-bullying Bill|last1=Middleton|first1=Josh|date=June 17, 2013|publisher=Philly Magazine|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>
