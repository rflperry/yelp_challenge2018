She had actually entered the race before Burton's retirement. New Jersey Governor and former U.S. Attorney [[Chris Christie]] endorsed and fundraised for Brooks.<ref>[http://www.mainjustice.com/2012/04/19/christie-endorses-fellow-former-u-s-attorney-in-indiana-house-race/ Christie Endorses Fellow Former U.S. Attorney in Indiana House Race | Main Justice<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>  In May 2012, she won the Republican primary with 30% of the vote, just one point ahead of the second-place finisher and former U.S. Congressman [[David M.

===2014 election===

Brooks's vote to end the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|October 2013 government shutdown]] led members of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] to support David Stockdale's campaign for her seat. In the primary election on May 6, Brooks defeated Stockdale and his fellow challenger, David Campbell, winning 73% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/apps/sos/primary/sos_primary14?page=office&countyID=-1&partyID=-1&officeID=5&districtID=-1&districtshortviewID=-1&candidate=|title=Secretary of State : Election Division: Election Results|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> On November 4, Brooks won the general election with 65% of the vote, defeating Democrat Shawn Denney and Libertarian John Krom.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Indiana's 5th Congressional District elections, 2014 - Ballotpedia|url = https://ballotpedia.org/Indiana's_5th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website = ballotpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}</ref>

===Legislation===
On July 29, 2015, Brooks introduced the Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act of 2015, H.R. 3299, bipartisan legislation that will dramatically transform and enhance the nation’s ability to respond to current and emerging biothreats. This legislation reforms our nation’s medical countermeasure acquisition process, incentivizes research to combat the next generation of deadly diseases, and increases accountability of preparedness spending. It is one of the legislative proposals highlighted by the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Panel Study on Biodefense as an important step towards shoring up our national security and preparedness for biothreats.

On June 17, 2015, Brooks introduced the Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act of 2015, H.R. 2805, which targets several areas of need critical to reducing the number of painkiller and heroin overdose deaths each year. The legislation will establish a working group to develop new guidance and best practices for members of the medical community, reauthorize prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) critical to local law enforcement efforts, increase access to life-saving Naloxone and raise public, provider, and patient awareness of opioid drugs. It is the companion bill to S. 1134, legislation introduced by Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) in April 2015.

On March 14, 2014, Brooks introduced the [[Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 (H.R. 4263; 113th Congress)|Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 (H.R. 4263, 113th Congress)]]; H.R. 623, 114th Congress), a bill that would direct the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] to establish within the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) a [[social media]] working group to provide guidance and best practices to the [[Emergency management|emergency preparedness and response]] community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a [[terrorist attack]].<ref name="4263sum">{{cite web|title=H.R. 4263 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4263|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> This legislation was reintroduced in 2015, and became law in November 2015.

On March 18, 2014, Rep. Brooks introduced the [[Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act (H.R. 4275; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would allow some charities, schools, and volunteer organizations to remain exempt from [[pension]] plan rules under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] (ERISA) and the [[Internal Revenue Code]].<ref name=4275sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4275 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4275|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=HouseExtends>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House extends tax-free typhoon aid to Philippines|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/201575-house-extends-tax-free-typhoon-aid-to-philippines|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> Brooks argued that the bill was needed because "some charities, schools and cooperatives are actually shutting down summer camps, cutting back on services to the community, or raising prices just to meet their pension obligations."<ref name="HouseExtends"/> The bill passed the House on March 24, 2014.

On July 29, 2015, Brooks introduced, along with Rep. [[Anna Eshoo]], the [[Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act of 2015]], H.R. 3299. The bill would streamline government decisions and provide incentives for vaccines and treatment of dangerous pathogens and diseases.<ref>{{cite news|title=Health Subcommittee holds markup on the Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/18994-health-subcommittee-holds-markup-on-the-strengthening-public-health-emergency-response-act/|accessdate=2016-06-24|work=Homeland Preparedness News|date=2016-06-08}}</ref> Brooks sponsored the bill in response to a report released in October 2015 by the [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]].<ref>[http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20160519/104953/HHRG-114-IF14-20160519-SD002.pdf Memo to Members of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health from the Majority Committee staff].
