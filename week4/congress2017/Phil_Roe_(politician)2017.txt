He was discharged as a [[major]] in 1974.<ref>http://www.roe4congress.com/about.htm</ref> He then went into [[OB/GYN]] practice in Johnson City, retiring after 31 years, including his work as a physician State of Franklin Healthcare Associates (SOFHA).

Roe defeated [[incumbent]] congressman [[David Davis (U.S. politician)|David Davis]] in the 2008 [[primary election|primary]] by 500 votes.<ref>{{cite news|first=Jim |last=Balloch |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2008/aug/08/roe-slides-past-davis-in-1st-district-house-race/ |title=Roe slides past Davis in 1st District House race|date=August 8, 2008 |work=Knoxville News Sentinel}}</ref> Davis blamed his loss on votes from Democrats who crossed over to vote for Roe in the open primary.<ref>[http://www.volunteertv.com/home/headlines/26420129.html Rep. Davis blames Democrats for loss in GOP primary]. [[Associated Press]] via [[WVLT-TV]], 2008-08-08.</ref> Roe had previously run for the seat in 2006 when 10-year incumbent [[Bill Jenkins (politician)|Bill Jenkins]] announced his retirement, but lost to Davis in that year's primary.

Roe defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Rob Russell, director of the Writing and Communication Center at [[East Tennessee State University]],<ref>[http://www.etsu.edu/academicaffairs/wcc/default.aspx ETSU Writing and Communication Center]</ref> in the November general election with 72 percent of the vote.  However, it was [[tantamount to election|widely presumed]] that Roe had clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary; Republicans have held the 1st District seat continuously since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859.

Roe won re-election in 2010 with 80.8% of the vote against Democrat Michael Clark.<ref>http://www.politico.com/2010/maps/#/House/2010/TN</ref>

===Tenure===
In a district known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington, Roe has promised to serve only 12 years (six terms) in the House.

Roe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman [[Robin Hayes]], as his chief of staff.<ref>{{cite news |title=Roe hires chief of staff, will step down as Johnson City mayor |first=Hank |last=Hayes |date=December 17, 2008 |url=http://www.timesnews.net/article.php?id=9010441 |work=[[Kingsport Times-News]] |accessdate=2009-01-10}}</ref> According to [[National Journal]]’s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/njmagazine/nw_20100227_7237.php |title=2009 VOTE RATINGS |date=February 27, 2010 |work=National Journal}}</ref>

On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the [[National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress)]] into the House. The bill would authorize the [[National Desert Storm Memorial Association]] to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in [[Operation Desert Storm]] or [[Operation Desert Shield]].<ref name=cbo503>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 503|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45267|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=28 May 2014}}</ref> Roe said "I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward."<ref name=roePRpass>{{cite web|title=Roe Bill to Establish War Memorial Passes House of Representatives|url=http://roe.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=381365|publisher=House Office of Phil Roe|accessdate=29 May 2014|date=28 May 2014}}</ref>

During June 2013, [[WJHL-TV]] in Johnson City reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in [[Greeneville, Tennessee|Greeneville]] on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were "money and greed" and because that decision by Kincaid created a "substantial risk of harm to patients," prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.<ref>http://www.wjhl.com/story/22467984/dr-kincaid-begs-judge-for-mercy-congressman-and-sheriff-write-letters-on-his-behalf "Dr. Kincaid begs judge for mercy, congressman and sheriff write letters on his behalf".
