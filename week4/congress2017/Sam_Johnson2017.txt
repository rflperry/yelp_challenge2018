;POW 
On April 16, 1966, while flying his 25th combat mission in [[Vietnam]], he was shot down over [[North Vietnam]] and suffered a broken arm and back. He was a [[prisoner of war]] for nearly seven years, including 42 months in solitary confinement. During this period, he was repeatedly [[torture]]d.

Johnson was part of a group of eleven U.S. military prisoners known as the [[Alcatraz Gang]], a group of prisoners separated from other captives for their resistance to their captors. They were held in "Alcatraz", a special facility about one mile away from the [[Hỏa Lò Prison]], notably nicknamed the "Hanoi Hilton". Johnson, like the others, was kept in solitary confinement, locked nightly in [[Legcuffs|irons]] in a windowless 3-by-9-foot concrete cell with the light on around the clock.<ref>Adams, Lorraine.

==Post-military career==
After his military career, he established a homebuilding business in Plano. He was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]] in 1984 and was re-elected four times.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
On May 8, 1991, he was elected to the U.S. House in a special election brought about by eight-year incumbent [[Steve Bartlett]]'s resignation to become [[List of mayors of Dallas|mayor of Dallas]]. Johnson defeated fellow [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] Republican [[Thomas Pauken]], also of Dallas, 24,004 (52.6 percent) to 21,647 (47.4 percent).<ref>''Congressional Quarterly's Guide to U.S. Elections'' 6th ed., [[Washington, D.C.]], 2010, p. 1341</ref> Johnson thereafter won a full term in 1992 and has been reelected nine times.  The 3rd has been in Republican hands since 1968. The Democrats did not even field a candidate in 1992, 1994, 1998, or 2004.

====Elections====

===Tenure===
{{BLP sources|date=March 2013}}
In the House, Johnson is an ardent [[Conservatism (United States)|conservative]]. By some views, Johnson had the most conservative record in the House for three consecutive years, opposing [[pork barrel]] projects of all kinds, voting for more [[Individual Retirement Account|IRAs]] and against extending unemployment benefits. The conservative watchdog group [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] has consistently rated him as being friendly to taxpayers. Johnson is a signer of [[Americans for Tax Reform#Taxpayer Protection Pledge|Americans for Tax Reform]]’s [[Taxpayer Protection Pledge]].<ref name ="ATR">{{cite web|title=The Taxpayer Protection Pledge Signers 112th Congressional List|url=http://s3.amazonaws.com/atrfiles/files/files/091411-federalpledgesigners.pdf|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=November 30, 2011}}</ref>

Johnson is a member of the conservative [[Republican Study Committee]], and joined [[Dan Burton]], [[Ernest Istook]] and [[John Doolittle]] in refounding it in 1994 after [[Newt Gingrich]] pulled its funding.  He alternated as chairman with the other three co-founders from 1994 to 1999, and served as sole chairman from 2000 to 2001.

On the Ways and Means Committee, he was an early advocate and, then, sponsor of the successful repeal in 2000 of the earnings limit for [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] recipients. He proposed the Good Samaritan Tax Act to allow corporations to take a tax deduction for charitable giving of food. He chairs the [http://edworkforce.house.gov/members/109th/mem-eer.htm Subcommittee on Employer-Employee Relations], where he has encouraged small business owners to expand their [http://edworkforce.house.gov/press/press109/first/06jun/pensionintro060905.htm pension] and<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.00525:health |title=Bill Summary & Status – 109th Congress (2005–2006) – H.R.525 – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date=2005-07-27 |accessdate=2010-08-29}}</ref> benefits for employees. In December 2016, Johnson introduced [https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/6489?r=37 H.R. 6489], a bill that would decrease [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] [[Social Security (United States)#Benefits|payments to retired individuals]] and [[Social Security (United States)#Normal retirement age|require individuals to wait two additional years]] in order to qualify for full retirement payments.<ref>Wolff-Mann, Ethan.

Johnson is a skeptic of calls for increased government regulation related to global warming whenever such government interference would, in his mind, restrict personal liberties or damage economic growth and American competitiveness in the market place. He also opposes calls for government intervention in the name of energy reform if such reform would hamper the market and or place undue burdens on individuals seeking to earn decent wages. He has expressed his belief that the Earth has untapped sources of fuel, and has called for allowing additional drilling for oil in Alaska.

Johnson is one of two Vietnam-era prisoners of war serving in Congress, along with [[John McCain]].<ref>{{cite news |title=McCain marks 40th anniversary of POW release |author=Catalina Camia |agency=USA Today |url=http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/03/gannett-mccain-marks-40th-anninversary-pow-release-031413 |newspaper=Army Times |date=14 March 2013 |accessdate=15 March 2013}}</ref>
