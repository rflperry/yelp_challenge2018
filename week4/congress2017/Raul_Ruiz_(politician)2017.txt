In 1997, while attending Harvard as a medical student, Ruiz participated in an annual [[Thanksgiving]] protest in [[Plymouth, Massachusetts]]. Ruiz was one of 25 people arrested at the event. The charges were later dropped as part of a deal that also dismissed claims of police brutality.<ref name="desert">{{cite news|last=McGinty|first=Kate|title=Mary Bono Mack and Raul Ruiz: A fact check on the congressional debate - |url=http://isun.blogs.mydesert.com/2012/10/12/mary-bono-mack-and-raul-ruiz-a-fact-check-on-the-congressional-debate/|accessdate=2014-04-25|newspaper=MyDesert.com|date=2012-10-12}}</ref>

Two years later, in 1999, Ruiz took part in another Thanksgiving protest at which he read a letter of support for [[Leonard Peltier]], who was convicted and sentenced to two consecutive terms of life imprisonment for first degree murder in the shooting of two [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) special agents during a 1975 conflict on the [[Pine Ridge Indian Reservation]]. During the 2012 congressional campaign, the incident was used as an attack by his opponent, Mary Bono Mack. In response, Ruiz's campaign stated that he had not supported Peltier.<ref name="desert"/><ref>{{cite news|last=Clarke|first=Chris|title=Coachella Valley Congress Race Turns Nasty|url=http://www.kcet.org/updaily/socal_focus/government/coachella-valley-congress-race-turns-nasty.html|accessdate=2014-08-19|publisher=KCET|date=2012-10-16}}</ref>
