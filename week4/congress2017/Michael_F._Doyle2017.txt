==Political positions==
Doyle voted against authorizing [[2003 invasion of Iraq|military force in Iraq]] and against the $87 billion emergency spending bill to fund US troops in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Doyle is the Co-Founder and Co-Chair of the Coalition on Autism Research and Education,<ref>[http://doyle.house.gov/autism.shtml ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100707024544/http://doyle.house.gov/autism.shtml |date=July 7, 2010 }}</ref> also known as the Congressional Autism Caucus, and he offered an amendment that was included in the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health reform law]] that will ensure that insurance companies will cover treatments for people with [[autism]].<ref>{{cite web|author=Rob Cullen |url=http://whatifpost.com/health-reform-and-autism.htm |title=Health reform and autism — What If Post |publisher=Whatifpost.com |date=2010-05-27 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>  He has also introduced legislation that will provide better services for adults with autism.

On abortion, Doyle falls into the category of “Pro-Choice”, voting against bills that would ban abortion,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/21853/mike-doyle-jr/2/abortion-issues|title=Mike Doyle's Voting Records on Issue:  - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref> as well as receiving very favorable ratings amongst pro-choice interest groups, such as [[NARAL Pro-Choice America|NARAL]], while scoring a 0 with pro-life groups such as the [[National Right to Life Committee]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21853/mike-doyle-jr/2|title=Mike Doyle's Ratings and Endorsements - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref> However, Doyle does not support federal funds to pay for abortions, excepting cases of rape, incest, or when the mother’s life is in danger. He does, however, support using federal dollars for Title X, family planning services and  support federal funding for [[Planned Parenthood]] with the existing provision that federal funds may not be used to perform abortions.<ref name="votesmart.org">http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/21853/mike-doyle-jr/</ref>

Doyle has fought against gun laws that would allow people to bring firearms into national parks, repeal any part of the assault or military style weapon ban,<ref name="votesmart.org"/> and voting to maintain parts of the D.C. gun ban.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/21853/mike-doyle-jr/37/gun-issues|title=Mike Doyle's Voting Records on Issue:  - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref> This has led to decreasing ratings with pro-gun interest groups such as the [[National Rifle Association|NRA]] (42% lifetime rating in 2000 to 0% in 2006) and [[Gun Owners of America]]. Conversely, he has received overall ratings from pro-gun control groups, receiving a 90% in the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] back in 2003.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21853/mike-doyle-jr/37|title=Mike Doyle's Ratings and Endorsements - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref>

Doyle supports comprehensive [[immigration reform]], voting for a bill that would repeal certain green card limitations, as well as the [[DREAM Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/21853/mike-doyle-jr/40/immigration|title=Mike Doyle's Voting Records on Issue:  - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref> These views have got him negative ratings from interest groups such as [[English First (lobbying organization)|English First]] (0%) and the [[Federation for American Immigration Reform]] (0%). His immigration reviews resonate stronger with the National Latino Congreso/William C. Velásquez Institute and [[American Immigration Lawyers Association]], in which he has received perfect scores from both groups.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/21853/mike-doyle-jr/40|title=Mike Doyle's Ratings and Endorsements - The Voter's Self Defense System - Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart}}</ref>

[[Liberalism in the United States|Liberals]] have praised him for his stance on [[copyright]] issues<ref>{{cite web|url=http://463.blogs.com/the_463/2007/03/perhaps_the_coo.html|title=The 463:  Inside Tech|publisher=}}</ref> and his support of [[net neutrality]].  He is the lead sponsor of HR 1147, the [[Local Community Radio Act]] of 2009 which will expand [[low-power broadcasting]] to hundreds of new [[community radio]] stations.  In 2010, he was given the Digital Patriot Award,<ref>{{cite web|author=Line:&nbsp; By Steve Smith |url=http://www.twice.com/article/452105-CEA_Gives_Vinton_Cerf_Reps_Doyle_Upton_Digital_Patriot_Awards.php |title=Consumer Electronics - Computer Retailers - Camera Retailers - CES |publisher=twice.com |date=2010-05-03 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref> along with [[Vint Cerf]], one of the creators of the technology that runs the [[Internet]].  In February 2013, he became one of the sponsors of the [[Fair Access to Science and Technology Research Act]] to expedite open access to taxpayer-funded research.<ref>http://lofgren.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=783&Itemid=130</ref> Doyle is a strong supporter of letting local governments provide Internet services in order to increase competition, improve service, and decrease prices.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Crawford|first1=Susan|title=How Cities Can Take On Big Cable|url=http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-06-27/how-cities-can-take-on-big-cable|accessdate=26 July 2014|publisher=Bloomberg News|date=2014-06-27}}</ref>

He used his position on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|House Energy and Commerce Committee]] and lead the negotiations to find common ground on legislation addressing [[climate change]] and promoting energy independence while protecting clean domestic manufacturing.<ref>{{cite web|last=Sheppard |first=Kate |url=http://www.grist.org/article/2009-06-25-pelosi-climate-bill-votes |title=Pelosi cracks the whips to get climate bill passed |publisher=Grist |date=2009-06-26 |accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>

Also, Doyle is an outspoken critic of the genocide in [[Sudan]] and [[Darfur]]. In a rally on April 28, 2007, he urged President Bush to uphold his promise of sending 20,000 peacekeepers to Darfur. He drew loud cheers when he said, "If we can have a surge in Iraq, there needs to be one in Sudan."  He supports [[LGBT]] issues.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.stonewalldemocrats.org/steel-city/node/1032|title=Completed Federal Questionnaire From MIKE DOYLE Who Is Seeking Re-Election To The United States House Of Representatives In District 14|publisher=Stonewalldemocrats.org|accessdate=2012-11-16}}</ref>

During the debate over the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|debt ceiling in 2011]], Doyle said about [[Tea Party Movement|Tea Party]] Republicans, "We have negotiated with terrorists. This small group of terrorists have made it impossible to spend any money".<ref>{{cite web|last=Allen|first=Jonathan|title=Sources: Joe Biden likened tea partiers to terrorists|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60421.html#ixzz1TuAIDnOZ|publisher=''Politico''|accessdate=3 August 2011|author2=John Bresnahan|date=2 August 2011}}</ref>

On October 16, 2012, Doyle released a statement criticizing the Republican budget introduced by [[Paul Ryan]], saying that it would “be devastating for seniors in Pittsburgh.” According to his report, this budget would eliminate new preventive care benefits for 113,000 [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] beneficiaries in the district, as well as other cuts to [[Medicaid]] affordable housing, and food stamps. “That’s why I voted against the Ryan budget when it was considered by Congress earlier this year, and why I am fighting hard to oppose Congressional Republicans' misguided priorities."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://doyle.house.gov/press-release/republican-budget-would-devastate-pittsburgh%E2%80%99s-seniors|title=Republican Budget Would Devastate Pittsburgh’s Seniors|publisher=}}</ref>

===Legislation supported===
*[[Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress)]] - a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.<ref name=3675cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3675 - CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45057|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=10 March 2014}}</ref> The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.<ref name=PeteVotesTransparency>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes for more transparency at the FCC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/200503-house-votes-for-more-transparency-at-the-fcc|accessdate=12 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=11 March 2014}}</ref> Doyle argued in favor of the bill because "the FCC is charged with overseeing industries that make up one-sixth of our national economy."<ref name="PeteVotesTransparency"/>
*[[Autism CARES Act of 2014]] - a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to [[autism spectrum disorders]] (autism) conducted by various agencies within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).<ref name=cbo4631>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4631|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45460|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Doyle co-sponsored the bill, saying that "every time new data is realized on autism spectrum disorders, the numbers become more and more troubling... this is why passage of the Autism Cares Act today is so important to continue research into the causes of autism."<ref name=MarcosVotes24>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House votes to reauthorize autism support programs|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/210446-house-votes-to-reauthorize-autism-support-programs|accessdate=25 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=24 June 2014}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 1994, Doyle was elected to Congress as a Democrat from the state's 18th District, which at the time was located in the eastern suburbs of Pittsburgh. The incumbent Republican, [[Rick Santorum]], was elected to the [[United States Senate]]. Doyle won by almost 10 points, in one of the few bright spots in a bad year for Democrats. He was reelected three times with no substantive opposition.

In 2002, the Pennsylvania state legislature reconfigured Doyle’s district, combining it with the Pittsburgh-based district of fellow Democrat [[William J. Coyne]].  In the process, the state legislature redrew most of western Pennsylvania's heavily Democratic areas into just two districts—the reconfigured 14th District and the 12th District of [[John Murtha]].  The potentially explosive situation of having two Democratic [[incumbent]]s face each other in the primary was defused when Coyne announced his retirement (even though the district contained more of Coyne's former territory than Doyle's) leaving Doyle as the sole incumbent. The new district is by far the most Democratic district in western Pennsylvania, and Doyle was completely unopposed in 2002 and 2004; in 2006 and 2008, his only opposition was [[Green Party (United States)|Green Party]] candidate [[Titus North]].<ref>{{cite news | url = http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06312/736544-177.stm | work = [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] | title = Anti-GOP tide costs Rep.
