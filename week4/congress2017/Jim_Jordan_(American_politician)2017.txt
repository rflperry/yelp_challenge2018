'''James Daniel "Jim" Jordan''' (born February 17, 1964) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OH|4}}, serving since 2007.  He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is located in the north-central portion of the state and includes [[Lima, Ohio|Lima]], [[Tiffin, Ohio|Tiffin]], and [[Elyria, Ohio|Elyria]].

== Early life, education and career ==
Jordan was born and raised in [[Champaign County, Ohio]] and attended [[Graham High School (St. Paris, Ohio)|Graham High School]], graduating in 1982. While at Graham, he was a four-time state wrestling champion with a career record of 150–1.  He graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1986, obtaining his bachelor's degree in economics.  Jordan was a two-time [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[Division I (NCAA)|Division I]] wrestling champion.  In the 1985 NCAA championship match, Jordan defeated future two-time Olympic gold medalist and four-time world champion [[John Smith (wrestler)|John Smith]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestlingstats.com/ncaa/pdf/brackets/NCAA%201985.pdf |title=55th NCAA Wrestling Tournament: 1985 |publisher=Wrestlingstats.com |accessdate=November 9, 2012}}</ref> He later earned a master's degree in education from the [[Ohio State University]] in [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]], and in 2001 obtained his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Capital University]], also in Columbus.  Before entering politics, he was an assistant wrestling coach with the Ohio State University wrestling program.

==Ohio General Assembly==
Jordan was first elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio General Assembly]] in November 1994 and went on to serve three terms as State Representative of the 85th Ohio House District. In 1996, he offered an amendment to the Welfare Reform Bill that limited the amount of time that an able-bodied individual could remain on welfare. He also created the Income Tax Reduction Fund, which required that any state revenue surpluses be used to lower the income tax burden on Ohioans rather than be used for further government spending.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

In 2000, he won a seat in the [[Ohio Senate]] by defeating independent candidate Jack Kaffenberger by a margin of 88 percent to 12 percent. In 2004, Jordan defeated Kaffenberger again, this time by a smaller margin of 79 percent to 21 percent. In May 2006, Jordan won the Republican primary race for the 4th Congressional district of Ohio. He also won a 100% lifetime rating from the Ohio Taxpayers Association, which endorsed Jordan in his bid for Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ohiotaxpayers.com |title=ohiotaxpayers.com |publisher=ohiotaxpayers.com |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

Jordan was named Watchdog of the Treasury (1996, 2000, 2004), Outstanding Legislator (2004), Outstanding Freshman Legislator (1996), Friend of the Taxpayer (1997), and Pro-Life Legislator of the Year (1998) by the United Conservatives of Ohio, the Defender of Life award from the Ohio Right to Life Society, and the 2001 Leadership in Government Award from the Ohio Roundtable and Freedom Forum.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Additionally, Senate President [[Bill Harris (Ohio politician)|Bill Harris]] appointed Jordan to be the chairman of the Senate Judiciary on Criminal Justice Committee.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Jordan won the Republican primary for the 4th District in 2006 after 26-year incumbent [[Mike Oxley]] announced his retirement.  Despite the strong anti-Republican mood in Ohio that year, Jordan skated to victory in the general election, defeating Democrat Rick Siferd, 60% to 40%.  The 4th has long been considered as one of the most (if not the most) Republican districts in Ohio and the nation; the district and its predecessors have been in Republican hands for all but 16 years since the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].

He was reelected in 2008, defeating Democrat Mike Carroll 65% to 35%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.state.oh.us/SOS/elections/electResultsMain/2008ElectionResults/congress110408.aspx |title=U.S. Congress: November 4, 2008 |publisher=Sos.state.oh.us |date=November 4, 2008 |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

During the 114th Congress, Jordan helped found the House [[Freedom Caucus]], a group of conservatives working to "support open, accountable and limited government, the Constitution and the rule of law, and policies that promote the liberty, safety and prosperity of all Americans." <ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2015/01/rep_jim_jordan_will_head_new_g.html|title=Rep.

Jordan said that "we need this special counsel to help us get to the truth because the so-called investigation by the Justice Department has been a joke. The current investigation has no credibility because it is being headed by a maxed-out donor who is financially invested in the president's success."<ref name=BedardMay2>{{cite news|last=Bedard|first=Paul|title=Next: Demand for special counsel to probe IRS scandal, Lois Lerner|url=http://washingtonexaminer.com/next-demand-for-special-counsel-to-probe-irs-scandal-lois-lerner/article/2548007|accessdate=May 12, 2014|newspaper=The Washington Examiner|date=May 2, 2014}}</ref>

Jordan has been a leading critic of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s [[Home Affordable Modification Program|Home Affordable Modification Program (HAMP)]] program, advocating for its shutdown.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704075604575356663725805580.html |title=Cleaning Up the Mortgage Mess |publisher=The Wall Street Journal |date=August 10, 2010 |accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>

Jordan has supported the continued production and upgrades of [[M1 Abrams]] tanks in his district. The Pentagon opposed the bipartisan action to maintain funding.<ref name='Lardner01'>{{cite news | first = Richard | last = Lardner |title=Army says no to more tanks, but Congress insists |date=April 28, 2013 |url=http://news.yahoo.com/army-says-no-more-tanks-congress-insists-115422396.html |work =Yahoo!

Jordan is against Planned Parenthood and actively supports defunding the organization after a series of videos purported to show that the organization profited from the sale of fetal tissue.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thefederalist.com/2015/09/29/a-quick-and-easy-guide-to-the-planned-parenthood-videos/ |title=A Quick and Easy Guide to the Planned Parenthood Videos |publisher=The Federalist |date=September 29, 2015 |accessdate=October 20, 2015}}</ref>
