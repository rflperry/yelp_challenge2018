===Tenure===
An office of the [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] agency was established in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado|Colorado Springs]] in Lamborn's district. The office opened in February 2009 and increased immigration enforcement agents in the area from two to ten. “The immediate need is to address those that have committed a crime and make sure they’re sent out of the country”, Lamborn said. However, this would not place in jeopardy employers who hire illegal immigrants in the first place or who pay these workers without any withholding tax or below the [[minimum wage]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gazette.com/articles/immigration_32122___article.html/office_illegal.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080122184431/http://www.gazette.com:80/articles/immigration_32122___article.html/office_illegal.html |archivedate=2008-01-22 |df= }}</ref>

Lamborn is one of the House Republicans leading the effort against public funding for the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]] and NPR ([[National Public Radio]]). "I have been seeking to push [[Big Bird]] out of the nest for over a year, based on the simple fact that we can no longer afford to spend taxpayer dollars on nonessential government programs. It's time for Big Bird to earn his wings and learn to fly on his own."

On August 24, 2007, Jonathan Bartha, who works for Focus on the Family (headquartered in Colorado Springs), and his wife Anna wrote a letter to the editor in a community newspaper expressing concerns about Lamborn's opposition to more restrictions on dog fighting. They were also concerned he had taken several campaign contributions from the gaming industry. A few days later, Lamborn allegedly left two voice mails threatening "consequences" if they didn't renounce their "blatantly false" letter. He also said that he would be "forced to take other steps" if the matter wasn't resolved "on a Scriptural level." The Barthas were shocked by the messages, and Anna Bartha called Lamborn's behavior "not anything we would ever anticipate an elected official would pursue."<ref>{{cite news|title=Lamborn message has couple in dismay|url=http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_6782060|publisher=Denver Post|accessdate=August 4, 2011|first=Erin|last=Emery|date=September 2, 2007}}</ref>

;"Tar Baby" Remark
On July 29, 2011, Lamborn appeared on a Denver radio program to discuss the debt crisis and the failure of Democrats and Republicans to reach a compromise on the problem. Lamborn stated "Now, I don't even want to have to be associated with [President Obama]. It's like touching a tar baby and you get it, you're stuck, and you're a part of the problem now and you can't get away."<ref>{{cite web|title=Doug Lamborn Tar Baby|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=URAAfREIRGA|work=youtube.com|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref> The term [[tar baby]] is sometimes considered to be a racial slur used towards [[African-Americans]]. Former Colorado House Speaker Terrance Carroll, an African-American, replied, “Looking beyond the fact that Congressman Lamborn's entire comment is nonsensical, his use of the term 'tar baby' is unfortunate because [of] the historical connotation of that term when used in conjunction with African Americans."<ref>{{cite web|title=GOP Rep.

On August 1, 2011, Lamborn apologized for his use of the slur, "When I said 'tar baby', I was talking economic quagmire that our country is finding ourselves in because of poor economic policy from the White House. I could have used a better term."<ref>{{cite web|title=Update: Rep.

;Refusal to attend 2012 State of the Union Address
On January 23, 2012, Lamborn announced he would not be attending the President's State of the Union address. According to his spokeswoman Catherine Mortenson, "Congressman Lamborn is doing this to send a clear message that he does not support the policies of Barack Obama, that they have hurt our country", and believed Obama was “in full campaign mode and will use the address as an opportunity to bash his political opponents."<ref>{{cite web|title=Doug Lamborn to ditch State of the Union speech as a protest|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0112/71833.html|work=politico.com|accessdate=November 20, 2016}}</ref>
