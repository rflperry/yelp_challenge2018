'''David Wayne "Dave" Loebsack''' (born December 23, 1952) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IA|2}}, serving since 2007. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

Prior to entering Congress, he was a professor of political science. He is currently the only Democrat in Iowa's entire congressional delegation.

==Early life, education and career==
Loebsack was born in [[Sioux City, Iowa]] and was raised in a single parent household of limited financial means. He graduated from East High School and attended college at [[Iowa State University]]. There, Loebsack earned both a bachelor's and a master's degree in political science.

After receiving a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] from the [[University of California, Davis]], Loebsack took a job as a political science professor at [[Cornell College]], a small liberal arts college in [[Mount Vernon, Iowa|Mount Vernon]], near [[Cedar Rapids]]. Today, he serves as a Professor Emeritus.<ref name="UShouse">{{cite web|url=http://loebsack.house.gov/biography|title=U.S. Congressman Dave Loebsack|publisher=U.S. Government|accessdate=2011-06-24}}</ref>

==Voting Record==
Consistently, David Loebsack has voted in line with the Democratic Party. Out of 1551 total votes, he has voted with the Democratic Party 90% of the time. He has voted consistently to protect a woman's right to get an abortion and to pass measures that instill regulations that aim to protect the environment. He strongly believes in Wall Street reform and regulation, is generally in opposition to [[bailouts]], and has stated that his “role in government is to help stick up for the little guy”.

===Economic Interest Group Ratings===
David Loebsack’s Interest Group Ratings concerning fiscal (economic) issues reinforce his general allegiance to party lines. Regarding the budget, spending, and taxes, he received 4% from [[Citizens Against Government Waste]] (2010), 36% from the National Journal Conservative Economic Policy Score (2011), and 64% from the National Journal Liberal Economic Policy Score (2011). Concerning Business and Consumers, Loebsack received 100% from the American Council of Engineering Companies (2009–2010), 0% from the Alliance for Worker Freedom (2008), and 66% from the National Small Business Association (2011).

===Social Interest Group Ratings===
Similar to Loebsack’s Interest Group Ratings regarding the economy, his social ratings also adhere to party lines. Regarding civil liberties and [[civil rights]], Loebsack has received 91% from the [[Human Rights Campaign]] (2009–2010), 95% from the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (2009–2010), and 20% from the [[Arab American Institute]] (2009–2010). Interestingly, Loebsack has generally scored high among Interest Groups involved in civil liberties. Concerning the Environment, he received 94% from the [[League of Conservation Voters]] (2011) and 90% from [[Environment America]] (2011). Finally, his Interest Group Ratings concerning abortion reflect the Democratic party position, predictably receiving 100% from [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] (2011) and 0% from the [[National Right to Life Committee]] (2011).

==Political campaigns==

===2006===
In 2006 Loebsack defeated 15-term incumbent [[Jim Leach]] in one of the biggest upsets of the cycle. Loebsack was nominated by a special convention of the 2nd District after failing to get the required number of signatures to be on the primary ballot. Since there was no one qualified for the ballot, the convention was called to determine the nomination.  The 2nd had been trending Democratic for some time (a Republican presidential candidate hasn't carried it since 1984), and was reckoned as the most Democratic district in the state.  It was taken for granted that Leach would have been succeeded by a Democrat once he retired.  Nonetheless, Leach was not on any Democratic target lists.  Loebsack won largely by running up an 8,395-vote margin in [[Johnson County, Iowa|Johnson County]], home to Iowa City.

===2008===
Loebsack was easily reelected in 2008, taking 57 percent of the vote over [[Mariannette Miller-Meeks]], a doctor from Ottumwa and the former president of the state medical society.

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Iowa, 2010#District 2}}
Loebsack faced Miller-Meeks again in 2010 and had a much more difficult time of it than he had two years earlier. He prevailed with only 51% of the vote, largely by running up a 13,900-vote margin in Johnson County. [[Terry Branstad]] easily carried the district in his successful bid to reclaim the governorship. [[Chuck Grassley]] carried every county in the district except Johnson; in fact, Johnson was the only county Grassley lost in his bid for another term.

===2012===
After redistricting moved Loebsack's home in Mount Vernon to the 1st District of fellow Democrat [[Bruce Braley]], Loebsack moved to Iowa City in the reconfigured 2nd.  The redrawn district is no less Democratic than its predecessor; it regained Davenport, which had been the anchor of the 2nd and its predecessors for decades before being shifted out of the district in the 2000s round of redistricting.
