===Elections===
{{update|section|2010|date=December 2016}}
He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 2004.  He won a crowded Republican primary in the newly created 10th District.  The district was thought to be so heavily Republican that no [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate even filed, effectively handing the seat to McCaul.

In 2006 he defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate Ted Ankrum and former [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] presidential candidate [[Michael Badnarik]] with 55% of the vote. McCaul won re-election once again in 2008, against Democratic candidate [[Larry Joe Doherty]] and Libertarian candidate Matt Finkel<ref name=2008electionresults>{{cite news

===Controversy===
{{criticism section|date=December 2016}}
In August 2011 [[AlterNet]] reported that McCaul, along with [[John Culberson]] and [[Ted Poe]], was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier's funeral.<ref name=rock/><ref name=alternet/> The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose [[Christianity|Christian]] ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three stated their demands were a response to [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals; however, VA state this claim is "blatantly false" as VA respects families' "rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries".<ref name=rock>{{cite web |url=http://rockbeyondbelief.com/2011/08/05/tx-congressmen-to-force-christian-prayer-over-my-dead-body/ |title=TX Congressmen to force Christian prayer over my dead body. |author=Griffith, Justin |date=August 5, 2011 |work=rockbeyondbelief.com |publisher= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref><ref name=alternet>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/world/152143/texas_legislators_and_christian_groups_fight_to_insert_god_into_vets'_funerals_--_against_families'_wishes/?page=entire |title=Texas Legislators and Christian Groups Fight to Insert God Into Vets' Funerals – Against Families' Wishes |author=DiBrance, Alex |date=August 23, 2011 |work=[[AlterNet]] |publisher= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

In September 2013, McCaul said that he would trust [[Russia]] rather than the United States to account for [[Syria]]'s chemical weapons stockpile.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/politico-live/2013/09/michael-mccaul-put-russian-boots-on-the-ground-172657.html|title=McCaul: Put Russian boots on the ground in Syria|author=Andrea Drusch|work=[[Politico]]}}</ref> He did say that the monitoring and destruction of the chemical weapons in Syria would have to be overseen by an international commission of the United Nations, emphasizing that Putin and Russia have superior leverage over Syria to better accomplish the removal of WMD from the Syrian arsenal.

On November 30, 2016 McCaul appeared on [[Fox News]] with [[Bret Baier]] to discuss his possible nomination to head the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] by president-elect [[Donald Trump]].  McCaul's interview was marred with controversy when Baier cited a ''[[Washington Times]]'' article quoting William Gheen of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC which said "We certainly hope that Donald Trump would not reward a deceptive pro-amnesty lawmaker like Michael McCaul with a Cabinet position," said William Gheen, president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC. "That would be very disappointing to all of us that believed his campaign promises to secure our borders and deport millions of illegal immigrants under current U.S. laws."<ref name=FoxNews>{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4w-QDEDtmTs |title=Rep.

On December 11, 2013, McCaul introduced the [[National Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 3696; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Homeland Security Act of 2002]] to require the [[Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) to conduct cybersecurity activities on behalf of the federal government and would codify the role of DHS in preventing and responding to cybersecurity incidents involving the [[Information Technology]] (IT) systems of federal civilian agencies and critical infrastructure in the United States.<ref name=cbo3696>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 3696|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr3696.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref><ref name=3696sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3696 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3696|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 28, 2014}}</ref> McCaul said that the bill was "an important step toward addressing the cyber threat."<ref name=WaddellThinkAdvisor>{{cite web|last1=Waddell|first1=Melanie|title=House Panel Passes Cybersecurity Bills|url=http://www.thinkadvisor.com/2014/07/29/house-panel-passes-cybersecurity-bills|website=ThinkAdvisor.com|accessdate=July 29, 2014|date=July 29, 2014}}</ref> According to McCaul, the bill "establishes a true partnership between DHS and the private sector to ensure the distribution of real-time cyber threat information in order to secure our nation in cyberspace without burdensome mandates or regulations."<ref name="WaddellThinkAdvisor"/>

In a December 2, 2016 [[Fox News]] op-ed, McCaul declared his intention to support legislation, in line with president-elect [[Donald Trump]]'s proposals, to build a wall along the [[Mexico–United States border]], to secure the border, and have [[Mexico]] and other [[Latin America]]n countries pay for these proposals.<ref>{{cite web | last1=McCaul | first1=Michael | title=Rep.
