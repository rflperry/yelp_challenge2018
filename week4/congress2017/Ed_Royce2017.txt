'''Edward Randall''' "'''Ed'''" '''Royce''' (born October 12, 1951) is an American politician who currently serves as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] for {{ushr|CA|39}}, and previously the 40th, serving in Congress since 1993. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], Royce became the Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] in 2013. The district encompasses parts of Orange County, Los Angeles County, and San Bernardino County, including the cities of Fullerton, Yorba Linda, Brea, Placentia, La Habra, Buena Park, Anaheim, Diamond Bar, Walnut, Rowland Heights, Hacienda Heights, La Habra Heights and Chino Hills.

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
Born in [[Los Angeles, California]], and graduating from [[Katella High School]] in Anaheim, Royce went on to earn his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in [[Accounting]] and Finance in 1977 from the [[California State University, Fullerton]]. He was a [[business]] owner and [[corporate tax]] manager for a [[Portland cement]] company before becoming a [[California State Senate|California State Senator]] in 1983, serving in that post until his election to the U.S. House of Representatives. Royce is married to the former Marie Therese Porter, a businesswoman and former Professor at California State Polytechnic University, Pomona.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
After redistricting following the [[1990 United States Census]], incumbent Republican U.S. Representative [[William Dannemeyer]] decided to retire and run for the [[United States Senate election in California, 1992|1992 U.S. Senate election]]. Royce won the Republican primary for what was then [[California's 39th congressional district]] and defeated Democrat Molly McClanahan in the general election with 57% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27873</ref> He won re-election to the 39th district four more times with at least 63% of the vote. After redistricting after the [[2000 United States Census]], his district was renumbered the 40th, and won re-election five more times, with at least 63% of the vote.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=812</ref>

;2012
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 39}}
After redistricting, Royce's home in Fullerton was drawn into the 39th district.  That district had previously been the 42nd District, represented by fellow Republican [[Gary Miller]].  Geographically, the new 39th was more Miller's district than Royce's; Miller retained 53 percent of his former territory.  However, Royce was favored to win the expected primary contest with Miller—the real contest in this heavily Republican district.  Miller opted to run in the nearby [[California's 31st congressional district|31st district]], effectively handing the seat to Royce.

As expected, Royce defeated Jay Chen in the general election.<ref name="Royce VoteSmart">{{cite web|title=Representative Edward 'Ed' R.

In 2011, Royce voted against the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012]] as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial.<ref>http://www.ibtimes.com/ndaa-bill-how-did-your-congress-member-vote-384362?page=1</ref>

Royce was criticized for attending a rally in his home county, in which members of anti-Muslim groups chanted at Muslim-American families attending Islamic charity event that they should "go home." Royce replied that the anti-Muslim chants were done by a splinter group, not the main group of protesters, and he disavowed the chants, saying "those remarks and conduct were disrespectful and offensive".<ref>{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/richard-adams-blog/2011/mar/03/orange-county-protest-islam | title = The ugly face of Islamophobia in Orange County, California | publisher = [[The Guardian|Guardian]] | date = 2011-03-03 | first = Richard | last = Adams | accessdate = 2011-03-03 | location=London}}</ref><ref>{{cite news | url = http://voices.washingtonpost.com/blog-post/2011/03/anti-muslim_rallies_spark_ange.html | title = Anti-Muslim videos spark anger; pro-Muslim rally planned for March 6 (#mar6) | publisher = [[Washington Post]] | date = 2011-03-04 | first = Melissa| last = Bell| accessdate = 2011-03-04}}</ref>

Royce has served as the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee since January 2013.  The Committee is known to be one of the most active and bipartisan in all of Congress.  During the Obama Administration’s negotiations with Iran, Royce was the leading critic in the House of the agreement, with his Committee leading numerous hearings to examine the agreement.  Following the Iran agreement, Royce’s legislation to sanction and cut-off funding for Iran’s terror proxy Hezbollah was signed into law in December 2015.  
Royce has also been at the center of the debate over the Administration’s response to the threat from ISIS, and led the Committee’s consideration of legislation finding ISIS complicit in genocide against Christians, Yazidis and other religious minorities in the Middle East in March 2016.    
Shortly after North Korea tested a nuclear device in early 2016, Congress passed – and the President signed – Royce’s legislation to sanction North Korea and those banks and companies around the world providing support to North Korea’s weapons program.

Royce is the Chair of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, previously serving as a Chair of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade in the 112th Congress.  In previous Congresses, Royce served as chairman of the International Relations Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation. During his tenure as Chairman of the Subcommittee on International Terrorism and Nonproliferation, Royce held hearings on Islamic terrorist threats and weapons of mass destruction.  Royce led efforts in the House to either secure or destroy shoulder-fired missiles around the world that otherwise may be susceptible to terrorists.<ref>[http://www.fas.org/blog/ssp/2006/05/rep_royce_introduces_legislati_1.php#more], [http://www.usnews.com/usnews/letters/articles/070520/28lett_2.htm]</ref> In the summer of 2006, Royce held much publicized Congressional hearings in [[San Diego, California]], and [[Laredo, Texas]], focusing on border vulnerabilities and [[international terrorism]].<ref>[http://www.townhall.com/columnists/RobertDNovak/2006/07/06/immigration_and_terrorism], [http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/07/07/AR2006070701247.html], [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/06/washington/06immigration.html?_r=1&oref=slogin], [http://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/08/us/08immig.html]</ref>
