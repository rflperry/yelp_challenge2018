He also worked for passage of the Protection of Marriage Act, [[California Proposition 22 (2000)|Proposition 22]], which banned [[Same-sex marriage]] in California, and after that initiative was overturned by the courts, he was an early supporter and active in the [[California Proposition 8 (2008)|Proposition 8]] campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.douglamalfa.com/about/ |title=About Doug LaMalfa &#124; Doug LaMalfa for U.S. Representative |publisher=Douglamalfa.com |date=2013-11-21 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref> LaMalfa authored ACA 22 to protect private property owners from government abuse of eminent domain.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} He also wrote the Forest Fire Protection Act of 2004 to allow landowners to make their rural lands fire-safe and without forest management.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

In November 2011, LaMalfa opposed a proposed [[high-speed rail|bullet train]] saying "In light of the High Speed Rail plan that was submitted and that the numbers still do not work, California in this dire fiscal crisis that we're in, we're going to introduce legislation to repeal the HSR Authority and the funding for that the state was going to put forward."<ref>[http://www.kmjnow.com/pages/landing?Move-Afoot-to-Derail-CAs-Bullet-Train-Pr=1&blockID=562442&feedID=806 ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref>

LaMalfa strongly opposed the [[National Popular Vote Interstate Compact]], which would eliminate the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. He argued "I think this is dangerous. It flies in the face of 220 years of election law. We have an electoral college; it was put there for a reason."<ref>{{cite web|author=DON THOMPSON, Associated Press1:10 p.m.July 14, 2011 |url=http://www.utsandiego.com/news/2011/jul/14/calif-lawmakers-approve-change-to-electoral-votes/ |title=Calif lawmakers approve change to electoral votes |publisher=UTSanDiego.com |date=2011-07-14 |accessdate=2014-04-13}}</ref>
