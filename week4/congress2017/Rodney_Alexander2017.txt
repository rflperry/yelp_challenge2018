'''Rodney McKinnie Alexander''' (born December 5, 1946) is an American politician and member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] who served as the Secretary of the [[Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs]] from September 30, 2013 until June 3, 2014. Previously he was the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|LA|5}} from 2003 to 2013. First elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he changed parties a half hour before the filing deadline on August 6, 2004. He was re-elected as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] five times. His district covered twenty-four parishes in roughly the northeast quadrant of the state but stretched much further south as a result of the [[2010 United States census|2010 census]].

On August 6, 2013, Alexander announced that he would not seek a seventh term in the House in the 2014 congressional elections. He cited his weariness with partisanship in [[Washington, D.C.]] as the primary reason for his decision to retire.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/315849-rep-alexander-to-retire|title=Alexandra Jaffe, "Rodney Alexander to retire from House"|publisher=thehill.com|accessdate=August 6, 2013}}</ref> On August 7, Alexander moved up his timetable for departure from Congress. He resigned his seat effective September 27; a [[Louisiana's 5th congressional district special election, 2013|special election]] was held to replace him, and an upset victory went to a political newcomer without support from the Republican leadership, [[Vance McAllister]], a businessman from [[Monroe, Louisiana|Monroe]], who is leaving the post effective January 3, 2015.

Alexander joined the administration of [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Bobby Jindal]] as the new secretary of the Louisiana Department of Veterans Affairs<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/6722936-125/us-rep-alexander-joining-jindal|title=Jordan Blum, Veterans job speeds D.C. exit|publisher=''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'', August 7, 2013|accessdate=August 8, 2013}}</ref> but remained in that post for only eight months. Upon resigning as veterans affairs secretary, Alexander did not indicate his future plans, but an aide told media representatives that Alexander is looking at opportunities in the private sector and would not be running for political office in the future.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.shreveporttimes.com/article/20140603/NEWS01/140603020/Rodney-Alexander-resigns-state-Veterans-Affairs-secretary|title=Rodney Alexander resigns as state Veterans Affairs secretary|publisher=''[[The Times (Shreveport)|Shreveport Times]]''|accessdate=June 3, 2014}}</ref>
