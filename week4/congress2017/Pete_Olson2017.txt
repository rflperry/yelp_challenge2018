[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] candidate [[Nick Lampson]] won in 2006 when the 11-term Republican incumbent, former [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]], was [[indicted]].  DeLay's resignation came too late for another Republican to replace him on the ballot, so Lampson defeated a Republican running as a [[write-in candidate]].

An October 22, 2008, poll by [[John Zogby]] and ''[[The Houston Chronicle]]'' stated that Olson had a 17-point lead over Lampson.<ref>{{cite news |first=Easha |last=Anand |title=Down the Homestretch: Texas’s 22nd District (Democratic Incumbent) |url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2008/10/27/down-the-homestretch-texass-22nd-district-democratic-incumbent/ |work=Wall Street Journal |publisher= |date=October 28, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |first=Jason |last=Thurlkill |title=Houston Chronicle/Zogby: Olson has 17 point lead over Lampson, Culberson holding off Skelly |url=http://www.politickertx.com/node/373 |work=PolitickerTX.com |date=October 27, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Houston Politics |url=http://blogs.chron.com/houstonpolitics/zogby_mon_results_22nd_tabs.pdf |format=PDF|work=Zogby International |publisher=Houston Chronicle |date=October 22, 2008 |accessdate=2008-10-28}}</ref> On October 30, 2008, [[Larry Sabato]] predicted in the [[Sabato's Crystal Ball|Crystal Ball]] that Olson's congressional race would be a race that would be a "Republican Pick Up."<ref>{{cite news |first=Larry |last=Sabato |title=The Last Word – Almost |work=Rassamussen Reports |page= |date=October 30, 2008 |accessdate=October 30, 2008|quote= |url=http://www.rasmussenreports.com/public_content/political_commentary/commentary_by_larry_j_sabato/the_last_word_almost}}</ref>

Lampson was considered the most vulnerable Democratic incumbent in the House because of the heavily Republican tilt of the district.  With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+15, it was the fourth most Republican district in the nation to be represented by a Democratic representative.  U.S. President [[George W. Bush]] carried the 22nd with 64 percent of the vote in 2004.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

Because of the unusual circumstances in District 22, the race attracted national attention. In 2007, [[Stuart Rothenberg]] called the district "arguably the best Republican takeover opportunity in the country".<ref name=Rothenberg_20070622>{{cite journal

;Republican primary race
In 2007, Olson announced he would run for the Republican nomination in the 22nd District.  He was one of 10 Republicans in the field.  Also running were Sekula-Gibbs, former [[Pasadena, Texas|Pasadena]] mayor John Manlove, former [[Sugar Land]] mayor [[Dean Hrbacek]], [[Texas House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Robert Talton]], Senior District Judge [[James D. Squier|Jim Squier]], [[Texas State Board of Education]] member Cynthia Dunbar, and three minor candidates.

Sekula-Gibbs won the first round with 30%.  Olson finished second, with 21%.  As Sekula-Gibbs finished well short of the majority needed to win the nomination outright, Olson and Sekula-Gibbs advanced to a runoff in April.<ref name="TSS_Rep">{{cite web|accessdate=2008-03-06|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/mar04_135_state.htm |title=2008 Republican Party Primary Election Returns |publisher=Texas Secretary of State's Office |archiveurl = http://web.archive.org/web/20080313053200/http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/mar04_135_state.htm <!-- Bot retrieved archive --> |archivedate = 2008-03-13}}</ref><ref name=HoustonChronicle_Bernstein_20080305>{{cite news

;General election race
Olson faced Lampson in the general election, and John Wieder, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]] candidate. Many election experts considered the race one of the best opportunities for the Republicans to pick up a Democratic seat.  [[Hastings Wyman]]'s ''[[Southern Political Report]]'' placed the race on its watch list because the roots of the district are solidly Republican, and Lampson won the seat with only 52 percent against a write-in candidate.<ref name=SouthernPoliticalReport_Wyman_20080526>{{cite news

===Election of 2010===

Olson won re-election in 2010 with 67 percent of the vote against Democratic challenger Kesha Rogers,<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2010/results/state/#val=TX | work=CNN | title=State Results – Election Center 2010 – Elections & Politics from CNN.com}}</ref> who on May 27, 2014, is a Democratic [[runoff election]] contestant for the U.S. Senate seat held by Olson's former employer, Republican John Cornyn, who seeks a third term in the November 4 general election.

===House tenure===

During the 2008 campaign, Olson claimed he was a better fit for the district than Lampson. Olson told ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reporter Leslie Eaton that "I have conservative values, and he (Lampson) doesn't." <ref name=WSJ_Eaton_20080721>{{cite news

Olson opposes the current incarnation of Interstate 69, which since 2002 has been part of Governor [[Rick Perry]]'s controversial [[Trans-Texas Corridor]], a project Gramm did not provide funding for as a U.S. Senator. The previous incarnation of I-69 (which Gramm did fund) was slated to go through the current U.S. Highway 59 which passes through Houston and outlying suburbs such as Sugar Land and [[Humble, Texas|Humble]].

On July 24, 2013, Olson voted to continue funding [[National Security Agency|NSA]] surveillance.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll412.xml</ref>

In mid-November 2013, Olson led a group of 19 other Republican congressmen in an effort to impeach Attorney General [[Eric Holder]], charging that Holder had refused to comply with a subpoena issued by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform]] in 2011 and that he had failed to enforce laws defending the [[Defense of Marriage Act]] (which had been declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court)<ref>"Twenty House Republicans call for Holder impeachment", ''The Hill'', November 13, 2014, [http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/190219-gop-members-seek-to-impeach-holder] Retrieved November 17, 2013</ref> or mandatory minimum sentencing for low-level drug offenders.
