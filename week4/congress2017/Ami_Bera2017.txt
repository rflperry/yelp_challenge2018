Bera announced a rematch against Lungren in 2012. The district had been renumbered as the 7th District, and made slightly friendlier to Democrats in redistricting.

On Tuesday, November 13, 2012, Bera attended freshman orientation as congressman-elect while votes were still being counted.<ref name=bee/> Candidates in these tight races sometimes attend the orientation by the Committee on House Administration, which was overseen by Bera's opponent, Dan Lungren.<ref>{{cite news|last=Thompson|first=Krissah|title=Congress welcomes freshmen, and those on the cusp of membership|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/congress-welcomes-freshmen-and-those-on-the-cusp-of-membership/2012/11/13/617d80be-2d17-11e2-9ac2-1c61452669c3_story.html|accessdate=15 November 2012|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=November 13, 2012}}</ref>

Bera ran for re-election in 2014, facing former Republican congressman [[Doug Ose]], who had represented what was then the 3rd from 1999 to 2005, in the general election.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cadelago|first1=Christopher|title=Bera, Ose headed for a fight over 7th congressional district|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/06/03/6455716/bera-leads-7th-congressional-ose.html|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=Jun 4, 2014}}</ref> The ''[[Rothenberg Political Report]]'' rated the 7th district "Lean Democratic," but ''[[The Sacramento Bee]]'' reported that Bera was "viewed by both parties as one of the most vulnerable Democrats in the country."<ref name=roll/><ref name=bee/> Bera was a member of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]'s Frontline program, designed to support vulnerable candidates.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Livingston|first1=Abby|title=DCCC Announces 26 Members on Frontline Incumbent Retention Program|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/dccc-announces-26-members-on-frontline-incumbent-retention-program|accessdate=August 25, 2014|publisher=Roll Call|date=March 5, 2013}}</ref> In June 2014, ''[[Politico]]'' reported that the DCCC planned to support Bera with $1.7 million in ads throughout fall 2014, and the House Majority PAC, a political action committee designed to support Democratic candidates, reserved $200,000 for late-election television ads.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Titus|first1=Elizabeth|title=Ami Bera will face Doug Ose in Sacramento-area district|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/ami-bera-doug-ose-2014-california-primary-election-107407.html|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=Politico|date=Jun 14, 2014}}</ref>

''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' reported that Bera's campaign received donations from parents of another Democratic candidate, [[Kevin Strouse]], only to have Bera's parents then donate a similar amount to Strouse's campaign.

In response to a poll, from the American Sikh Committee to Evaluate Congressional Candidates, Bera did not answer two questions relating to the Indian government's part in the [[1984 anti-Sikh riots]]. Instead, he noted that in 2005, the former Indian Prime Minister, [[Manmohan Singh]], had publicly apologized to the Sikh community for the government's role. Bera also stated that, while it was a tragedy, he was more focused on the treatment of Sikhs in the U.S. and could not dictate how the Indian government should approach the matter.<ref name=Sikh>{{cite news|last1=Magagnini|first1=Stephen|title=Sacramento Sikhs split with Bera over Indian government's role in 1984 massacre|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2014/09/24/6731046/sacramento-sikhs-split-with-bera.html|accessdate=October 7, 2014|newspaper=Sacramento Bee|date=September 24, 2014}}</ref> In response, some members of the Sikh-American community publicly withdrew their support for Bera. But with the majority of the Sikh-American population coming from outside of Bera's district, the advocates acknowledged that they were unlikely to affect the outcome of the race.<ref name=Sikh/>

Bera won re-election, receiving 50.4% of the vote to Ose's 49.6%. In May 2016, Ose was present at the proceedings against Bera's father, Babulal, to "observe justice".<ref name="BeeBera"/><ref name="Philly" />

====2016====

Bera ran for re-election in 2016. He faced Republican [[Scott Jones (U.S. politician)|Scott Jones]], the sheriff of Sacramento County, in the general election.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Miller|first1=Jim|title=Ami Bera snubbed by California labor group in endorsement list|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article89472652.html|accessdate=5 August 2016|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=July 13, 2016}}</ref> Bera defeated Jones in the general election, winning 51% of the vote to Jones' 49%.

===Tenure===
In an interview covered in the ''Elk Grove Citizen'', Bera said his first year in Congress "was about being focused here in the district but also building my reputation in Washington, D.C."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gold|first1=Bryan|title=Bera discusses first year in office|url=http://www.egcitizen.com/articles/2013/12/24/news/doc52b9c47c19a51608223299.txt|accessdate=25 August 2014|publisher=Elk Grove Citizen|date=December 24, 2013}}</ref>

In October 2013, Bera announced that he would give up his federal pay for the duration of the government shutdown. He also announced that in response to sequester cuts, he would donate 8.2% of his check each month to local organizations impacted by sequester cuts.<ref>{{cite news|last=Villatoro|first=Carlos|title=Congressman Bera Gives Up Pay Earned During Shutdown|url=http://elkgrove.patch.com/groups/politics-and-elections/p/congressman-bera-gives-up-pay-earned-during-shutdown|accessdate=May 26, 2014|newspaper=Elk Grove Patch|date=October 2, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, Bera voted against repeal of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/healthwatch/politics-elections/304727-nrcc-hits-calif-dems-over-obamacare-rates|title=NRCC hits Calif.

Bera plagiarized corporate talking points in an editorial he wrote in support of his vote for the TPA (fast track authority for the Trans Pacific Partnership). He later wrote an apology for copying the corporate line too closely.<ref>{{cite news |author=Christopher Cadelago |date=May 5, 2015 |title=Ami Bera admits Bee op-ed on trade included 'widely used' statements |newspaper=Sacramento Bee |url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/capitol-alert/article20312178.html}}</ref>

In January 2016, the Elk Grove-South County Democratic Club, Bera's home club, voted against endorsing him, citing concerns with Bera's record on trade and Syrian refugees.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cockerham|first1=Sean|title=Rep.

According to the ''Sacramento Bee'', "for years [Bera] has engaged in a complex series of campaign donations involving his parents and the families of other congressional candidates." Bera and his family have written checks to other Democrats, almost always for the maximum amount allowed under federal law, and those candidates or their families in turn have given similar amounts to Bera. The contributions usually occur within days of one another. This form of 'donor swapping' is legal under current law.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Cadelago|first1=Christopher|title=Ami Bera fundraising pattern sidesteps donation limits|url=http://www.sacbee.com/news/investigations/the-public-eye/article78992527.html|accessdate=31 May 2016|publisher=Sacramento Bee|date=May 21, 2016}}</ref>
