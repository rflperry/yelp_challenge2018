===Elections===
;2012
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2012#District 17}}
Pennsylvania Republicans, who controlled the redistricting process after the [[2010 United States Census]], significantly altered Holden's [[Pennsylvania's 17th congressional district|17th district]]. The old 17th had been based in [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]], but the new 17th had been pushed well to the north and east. In the process, it absorbed heavily Democratic Scranton and Wilkes-Barre, previously in the 11th District.<ref>{{cite web|last=Lindsey|first=Zach|url=http://www.lehighvalleylive.com/elections/index.ssf/2012/04/matt_cartwright_in_victory_ove.html|title=Matt Cartwright in victory over U.S. Rep. Tim Holden: Time to 'rebuild' |publisher=The Express-Times|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref> Had the district existed in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] would have carried it with 56 percent of the vote; by comparison [[John McCain]] carried the old 17th with 51 percent of the vote.

It was widely believed that Holden, a member of the [[Blue Dog Coalition]], would face a tough fight to secure re-election in the primary. Not only was the district significantly bluer than its predecessor, but it was located in territory that he did not know and did not know him. The only portion of the district that had been in the old 17th was Holden's home in [[Schuylkill County]], with the majority of Democratic primary voters located in counties considered more favorable to Cartwright's candidacy.<ref name=papolitics>{{cite news|first=Keegan|last=Gibson|title=Cartwright Poll: Cartwright Leads Holden 42-36|url=http://www.politicspa.com/cartwright-poll-cartwright-leads-holden-42-36/33790|work=PoliticsPA|publisher=|date=2012-04-09|accessdate=2012-06-18}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Bland|first=Scott|title=Holden Loses Re-Election Bid to Cartwright|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2012/04/holden-loses-re.php|newspaper=National Journal|date=April 24, 2012}}</ref> During the primary, Cartwright described himself as being from "the Democratic wing of the Democratic Party" â€” a line often employed by [[Howard Dean]] and [[Paul Wellstone]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Joseph|first=Cameron|title=Holden gets primary challenge in Pa.|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/206409-holden-gets-primary-challenge-in-pa|newspaper=The Hill|date=January 25, 2012}}</ref> He was supported by [[MoveOn.org]], the [[League of Conservation Voters]], and the [[Campaign for Primary Accountability]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Isenstadt|first=Alex|title=Jason Altimire, Tim Holden fall in Pennsylvania primaries|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0412/75577.html|newspaper=Politico|date=April 25, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Sledge|first=Matt|title=Matt Cartwright, Environmentalist Candidate, Wins Pennsylvania Primary With Help Of Oil Magnates|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/04/25/matt-cartwright-tim-holden-pennsylvania-primary_n_1452508.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=April 25, 2012}}</ref> Cartwright ran as a self-professed "FDR Democrat", and as an ally of President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] on taxes and [[health care reform]], and pledged to work with U.S. Senator [[Robert P.

Cartwright also benefited in the race from endorsements from popular local public figures like [[Pennsylvania House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Phyllis Mundy]] and former Scranton mayor Jimmy Connors.

Holden's opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and his support of energy legislation that included the [[Halliburton loophole]] are believed to have contributed to his defeat.<ref>{{cite news|last=Weisman|first=Jonathan|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2012/04/26/us/politics/2-house-democrats-defeated-after-opposing-health-law.html?_r=1|title=2 House Democrats Defeated After Opposing Health Law|publisher=The New York Times|date=April 25, 2012|accessdate=June 9, 2012}}</ref>
