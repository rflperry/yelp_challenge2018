'''David Schweikert''' (born March 3, 1962) is a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Arizona]], serving since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  He currently represents {{ushr|Arizona|6}}, which includes most of northern [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] as well as [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Paradise Valley, Arizona|Paradise Valley]], and [[Cave Creek, Arizona|Cave Creek]].  He previously represented the [[Arizona's 5th congressional district|5th District]] from 2011 to 2013.

He previously served two terms in the [[Arizona State House of Representatives]] (1991–1994), was chairman of the state Board of Equalization (1995–2004), and was the elected [[Maricopa County]] Treasurer (2004–2007). He ran for the U.S. House of Representatives three times: losing a primary to [[J.D. Hayworth]] in 1994, losing the general election to incumbent [[Harry Mitchell]] in 2008, and then defeating Mitchell in 2010.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Schweikert was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to an unwed mother who, according to Schweikert, almost aborted him but chose instead to put him up for adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifenews.com/2013/01/18/congressman-i-was-almost-an-abortion-victim-adoption-saved-me/?utm_content=buffera72e7&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter.com&utm_campaign=buffer |title=Congressman: I Was Almost an Abortion Victim, Adoption Saved Me |publisher=LifeNews.com |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>Abortion, except to save the life of the mother, was a crime in California in 1962, see Penal Code s. 274 (prior to 1967 amendment).  The article fails to explain how the existence of the criminal statute prevented anyone determined to obtain an abortion, and able to travel to Mexico, from obtaining one.</ref> He grew up in Scottsdale with his adoptive parents and two adoptive siblings. He graduated from [[Saguaro High School]] there (1980), then earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (finance and real estate, 1985) and [[MBA]] (2005) from the [[Arizona State University]]'s [[W. P. Carey School of Business]].

Schweikert and his wife Joyce live in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]].

==Arizona House of Representatives (1991–1995)==
Schweikert was elected to the [[Arizona State House of Representatives]] for District 28 in 1990, and re-elected in 1992.<ref>

Quayle, whose home in Phoenix had been drawn into the 9th but was just outside the boundaries of the 6th, opted to seek re-election in the 6th as well. During the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticised for a mailer that accused Quayle of "going both ways", suggesting that he was [[bisexual]]. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator [[Jon Kyl]] said that "such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office" and Senator [[John McCain]] said the mailer was one of the "worst that I have seen" and that it "crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse." Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer "utterly false" and "a sleazy smear tactic." Schweikert's spokesman responded that people "should get their minds out of the gutter" because the mailer was "obviously" referring to "'both ways'—as in liberal and conservative." ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had "never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way" and said that it was "difficult to believe" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2012/08/06/kyl-faults-schweikert-after-mailer.html |title=Kyl faults Schweikert after mailer says Quayle 'goes both ways' – Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nowicki |first=Dan |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/08/03/20120803district-6-schweikert-like-fight-in-dc.html |title=District 6 race: David Schweikert says 'I like the fight' in D.C |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/members/Blog/azdc/169420 |title=azcentral.com staff blogs – AZ/DC Blog – azdc – McCain endorses Quayle, scolds Schweikert for mailer |publisher=Archive.azcentral.com |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/243973-mccain-blasts-arizona-republican-who-accused-quayle-of-going-both-ways |title=McCain blasts Arizona Republican who accused Quayle of ‘going both ways’ |publisher=TheHill.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>

;Immigration
Schweikert argues that the state's immediate objective must be to secure the border against [[smuggling]] and [[illegal immigration]]. After it is "truly secure," lawmakers can proceed to establish a "common sense temporary [[guest worker]] program to enable businesses to obtain the employees they need." Additionally, Schweikert firmly opposes amnesty and "[[sanctuary cities]]."

;Defense
Schweikert has said the government should make providing resources to national intelligence, the military and law enforcement a high priority.<ref name="david08.com"/>

;Firearms
Schweikert opposes restrictions on gun ownership. He has received an "A" rating from both the [[National Rifle Association]] and [[Gun Owners of America]]. He was endorsed by the NRA in his 2010 election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/candidate/106387/david-schweikert |title=Summary: Representative David Schweikert |publisher=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> Schweikert voted in favor of the National Right-To-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011.

;Spending
In November 2011, Schweikert wrote a letter to President Obama objecting to $70,000 spent by the State Department on books authored by Obama, asking the President return the royalties.<ref>{{cite web |last=Cohn |first=Alicia M. |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/191095-rep-schweikert-asks-obama-to-return-book-royalties |title=Rep. Schweikert asks Obama to return book royalties |publisher= The Hill |date=November 1, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref> Embassies used the books as gratuity gifts and also to stock libraries in various countries.

Schweikert believes that economic prosperity hinges on balancing the federal budget and making "hard choices" on entitlement programs like Medicare and Social Security.<ref>{{cite web|first=David |last=Schweikert |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/campaign/144187-what-happened-to-the-calculator |title=What happened to the calculator? |publisher=The Hill |date=February 15, 2011 |accessdate=February 24, 2012}}</ref>

;Abortion
Schweikert is strongly pro-life as proven by his vote for the Title X Abortion Provider Act, an Act that would deny all federal funding to Planned Parenthood. In addition, he voted yes for the No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act in which the Act would ban any taxpayer from funding abortions.<ref name="Vote Smart- David Schweikert">{{cite web|title=David Schweikert|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/106387/david-schweikert/|publisher=Vote Smart|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref>  After his birth mother decided against an abortion, she gave birth to him at an unwed mother’s home where he was adopted.<ref name=DailyCaller>{{cite news|last=Schweikert|first=David|title=Why I am pro-life|url=http://dailycaller.com/2012/01/21/why-i-am-pro-life/|accessdate=28 June 2013|newspaper=Daily Caller|date=2012-01-21}}</ref>

When asked about his stance on abortion, Schwiekert said "In a still struggling economy, when our top priority should be creating jobs and paying down our debt, taxpayers need not be asked to open their checkbooks for such a controversial cause. Especially if that cause is taking the life of an innocent unborn child."<ref name="Vote Smart- David Schweikert" />

;Balancing the budget
Schweikert is against an income tax increase on any tax bracket: he signed Americans for Americans for Tax Reform: The Taxpayer Protection Pledge. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge is a pledge that many GOP candidates signed stating that they will oppose any and all efforts to increase the income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses, and oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and
credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.<ref name="Vote Smart- David Schweikert" />  [[FreedomWorks]], a "lower taxes, less taxes, more freedom" interest group, endorsed Schweikert in the 2012 general election.<ref name="Vote Smart- David Schweikert" />

;Environment and energy policy
Schweikert voted yes on Opening the [[Continental shelf]] to oil drilling and voted yes for drilling in [[Arctic National Wildlife Refuge]], in pursuit of coal. He voted to bar the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] from regulating [[greenhouse gas]]es.<ref name="David Schweikert Enviornmental Stance">{{cite web|title=David Schweikert|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/David_Schweikert.htm |publisher=Jesse Gordon- OntheIssues.org|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax//wp-content/uploads/2010/06/schweikert.pdf |format=PDF |title=U.S. House Candidate David Schweikert Applauded for Signing No Climate Tax Pledge |publisher=Americansforprosperity.org |accessdate=2015-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219061216/http://americansforprosperity.org/noclimatetax/ |archivedate=2015-02-19 |df= }}</ref>

Schweikert signed the American's For Prosperity "No Climate Tax Pledge" in which he will "oppose any legislation relating to climate change that includes a net increase in government revenue".<ref name="David Schweikert Enviornmental Stance"/>

''[[Politico]]'' quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman [[Lynn Westmoreland]] of Georgia as explaining that Schweikert, Amash and Huelskamp were removed for "their inability to work with other members." The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland "said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising]." The three were described by ''Politico'' and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as "jerks" who "made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team".<ref name="The a—hole factor">{{ cite news | last=Allen |first=Jonathan | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/house-leaders-make-examples-of-obstinate-members-85034.html | title='The a—hole factor' | publisher=Politico | date=December 13, 2012 | accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name="'Obstinate' Factor Continues to Roil GOP">{{cite news|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/obstinate_factor_continues_to_roil_gop-219926-1.html|title='Obstinate' Factor Continues to Roil GOP|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=April 30, 2014|publisher=Roll Call}}</ref>{{rp|p.2}}
