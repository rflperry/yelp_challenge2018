===Tenure===
Like Bill Archer, Culberson is an ardent fiscal and social conservative. His website includes his slogan "Letting Texans run Texas," which Culberson sees as a way to personify historical [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonian]] values.  Culberson is a member of the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]].{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On ''[[Hardball with Chris Matthews]]'', Culberson defended [[Texas]] [[Governor]] [[Rick Perry]]'s secession comments saying "don't make too much of what Gov. Perry said, again, he was just revved up and I think in the heat of the moment said something that he certainly didn't mean in his heart. [Texans are] patriotic Americans. No one wants Texas to secede" .{{Citation needed|date=April 2009}}

On June 12, 2009, Culberson signed on as a co-sponsor of [[H.R. 1503]], the bill introduced as a reaction to [[Barack Obama citizenship conspiracy theories]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:HR01503:@@@P |title=Bill Summary & Status – 111th Congress (2009 – 2010) – H.R.1503 – Cosponsors – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-09-13}}</ref>

On August 1, 2008, to protest  the House going into summer recess without discussing a pending energy bill, Culberson and other House Republicans stayed to make speeches about the energy bill in question.  The [[Democratic Party (US)|Democratic]] leadership in the House, which controls services in the chamber, responded by cutting the microphones and cameras.  Culberson used the Twitter and Qik services to provide a live account of the proceedings. Culberson later compared this episode to the Iranian government's brutal crackdown against Twitter-coordinated protesters in June 2009.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/47549/has-pete-hoekstra-been-beaten-by-nancy-pelosis-militia |title=Has Pete Hoekstra Been Beaten Up by Nancy Pelosi’s Militia?

===Legislation===
On April 17, 2014, Culberson introduced the [[Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2015 (H.R. 4486; 113th Congress)]] into the United States House of Representatives.<ref name=4486sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4486 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4486|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=2 May 2014}}</ref> The bill would make [[appropriations bill (United States)|appropriations]] for fiscal year 2015 for military construction and the [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs]].<ref name=nextweek25ap>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=Next week:Appropriations season begins|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/204424-next-week-appropriations-season-begins|accessdate=1 May 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=25 April 2014}}</ref> The total amount appropriated by the introduced version of the bill is $71.5 billion, approximately $1.8 billion less than fiscal year 2014 due to a decrease in the need for military construction.<ref name="nextweek25ap"/>

==Political campaigns==
Culberson won the Republican nomination for the 7th District in 2000 after 15-term incumbent [[William Reynolds Archer, Jr.|Bill Archer]] announced his retirement. He finished first in the Republican primary — traditionally the real contest in what has historically been a heavily Republican district – and defeated Peter Wareing in the runoff. He won easily in November, taking about 75% of the vote.

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2008#District 7}}
In 2008, Culberson faced his stiffest challenge to date in businessman [[Michael Skelly (Texas politician)|Michael Skelly]] in the November 2008 election. Skelly, a former executive of [[Horizon Wind Energy]], also served in the [[Peace Corps]] and earned an MBA from [[Harvard University]]. Skelly served on Mayor Bill White's Green Building Advisory Committee.<ref>[http://www.skellyforcongress.com Skelly for Congress]
</ref> Culberson led with 56 percent of the vote with about two-thirds of precincts counted. Skelly had 43 percent of the vote.  This was the closest a Democratic candidate had come to winning the district since it was created in 1967.  Historically, Republicans at all levels garner well over 60 percent of the vote in this district.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}}

As of June 30, 2008, Culberson had raised $983,204 with $550,228 cash on hand. As of the same date, Skelly had raised $1,465,519 with $1,050,314 cash on hand—more than any of Culberson's four previous challengers. In the previous four election cycles, Culberson had raised  $1,092,972 (2000), $508,138 (2002), $628,783 (2004), and $718,882 (2006). In 2006, Jim Henley raised $122,145.<ref>[http://opensecrets.org/races/summary.asp?ID=TX07 Race: Texas District 07] ''Open Secrets'', total raised and spent by year</ref>

===2014===

In the November 4, 2014 general election, Culberson again defeated Democrat James Cargas, who polled 4,092 votes (62.1 percent) in the March 4 primary election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=3852&id=407|title=Democratic primary election returns|publisher=team1.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 6, 2014}}</ref> Culberson was unopposed in the Republican primary.

James Cargas (born 1966) of Houston, who garnered 111,991 ballots (43.8 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist319_state.htm|title=Election Results|date=November 8, 2016|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=December 18, 2016}}</ref>

==Controversy over soldiers' funerals and 9/11 reference==
In August 2011, [[AlterNet]] reported that Culberson, along with [[Ted Poe]] and [[Michael McCaul]], was attempting to remove the right of deceased soldiers families to choose which prayers, if any, were to be read at a soldier's funeral.<ref name=rock/><ref name=alternet/> The three politicians were said to be attempting to impose Christian ceremonies on the military funerals of everybody who has served in the military, regardless of whether or not the deceased was Christian and with or without the consent of the family of the deceased. The three politicians stated their demands were a response to [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] (VA) banning Christian prayers at military funerals, however, VA state this claim is "blatantly false" as VA respects a families "rights to pray however they choose at our national cemeteries".<ref name=rock>{{cite web |url=http://rockbeyondbelief.com/2011/08/05/tx-congressmen-to-force-christian-prayer-over-my-dead-body/ |title=TX Congressmen to force Christian prayer over my dead body. |author=Griffith, Justin |date=August 5, 2011 |work=rockbeyondbelief.com |publisher= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref><ref name=alternet>{{cite web |url=http://www.alternet.org/world/152143/texas_legislators_and_christian_groups_fight_to_insert_god_into_vets'_funerals_--_against_families'_wishes/?page=entire |title=Texas Legislators and Christian Groups Fight to Insert God Into Vets' Funerals – Against Families' Wishes |author=DiBrance, Alex |date=August 23, 2011 |work=[[AlterNet]] |publisher= |accessdate=September 6, 2011}}</ref>

Culberson also courted controversy in 2013, when he said "like 9/11, 'let's roll!'" to describe a vote to make a delay of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] a condition for funding the government.<ref>{{cite news|last1=MacGillis|first1=Alec|title=Meet the House Republican Who Compared Himself to the Flight 93 Heroes|url=http://www.newrepublic.com/article/114924/meet-john-culberson-house-republican-who-said-lets-roll|accessdate=4 December 2014|work=The New Republic|date=30 September 2013}}</ref>

===Letter to President Obama regarding executive action over gun control===

On January 5, 2016, Representative John Culberson, as the chairman of the house appropriations subcommittee which has jurisdiction over the Justice Department, wrote to Attorney General Loretta Lynch threatening to withhold the Department’s funding for fiscal 2016 and 2017 in opposition to President Obama’s executive order to regulate gun purchases.  He warned, "The House Appropriations Committee will not provide resources to your department for the development of unlawful limitations on the unambiguous Second Amendment rights of Americans."  Furthermore, Culbertson wrote that the committee’s expectation that the Justice Department will "allocate its resources to the enforcement of existing law" and that he looks "forward to reviewing a fiscal year spending plan and fiscal year budget request that enforces federal law and does not create new law."<ref>"House Appropriator Threatens to Block Justice Funding Over Gun Control, " ''Government Executive,'' 1/5/16</ref>
