==Political positions==

===Online gambling===
Scott is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of online [[poker]].  In 2006, he cosponsored H.R. 4777, the Internet Gambling Prohibition Act<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4777]</ref> and voted for H.R. 4411, the [[Goodlatte]]-Leach Internet Gambling Prohibition Act.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04411: Thomas (Library of Congress): HR 4411]</ref>  In 2008, he opposed H.R. 5767, the Payment Systems Protection Act (a bill that sought to place a moratorium on enforcement of the [[Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act]] while the [[U.S. Treasury Department]] and the [[Federal Reserve]] defined "unlawful Internet gambling").

===Healthcare Reform===
David Scott voted for healthcare reform. In the discussion leading up to his vote, Congressman Scott fielded several different points of view. On August 6, 2009, Scott was confronted by a local doctor who claimed to live in Scott's district.  The doctor, who later appeared in subsequent debates with his opposition candidate, asked Scott why he was going to vote for a health care plan similar to [[Massachusetts health care reform|the plan implemented in Massachusetts]] and if he supported a government-provided health care insurance option. Scott questioned whether or not the doctor was a resident of Scott's district, although the local TV station [[WXIA-TV]]'s news department confirmed that the doctor did live and work in Scott's district.<ref>{{cite news

===Fiscal policy===
Although Scott voted against the first version of the 2008 bailout, he backed the final version "after being assured the legislation would aid homeowners facing foreclosures. Scott crafted an added provision dedicating $14 billion to aid those homeowners."<ref name="Political Overview"/>

===Same-sex marriage===
Scott supported two failed pieces of legislation in 2004 and 2006 that aimed to establish a constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage.<ref name="Political Overview">{{cite news|title=David Scott (D-Ga.)|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/david-scott-d-ga/gIQAoN2QAP_topic.html|work=Who Runs Gov|publisher=The Washington Post|accessdate=25 June 2012|first=Felicia|last=Sonmez}}</ref><ref name="LBGT Rights David Scott">{{cite web|title=Electful LBGT Rights|url=http://electful.com/candidate/david-scott/issues/gay-rights|work=Electful|publisher=Electful|accessdate=25 June 2012}}</ref>
However, in May 2013 thinkprogress.org reported receiving an email from a spokesman of Scott saying, 'Congressman Scott fully supports marriage equality.'<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thinkprogress.org/lgbt/2013/05/03/1958671/another-house-democrat-endorses-marriage-equality//}}</ref> HRC's profile of Scott also contains this sentence as his statement under 'position on marriage equality'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/elected-officials/profile/house/226#.UYO6erU3s5q}}</ref>

===Iran deal===
Scott has announced his opposition to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], saying that “It’s a good deal for Iran, for Russia, China and probably Hezbollah, but is it not, definitely not a good deal for Israel or for the United States or our allies – especially Jordan and Saudi Arabia . . . ” <ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/national-security/250261-the-hills-whip-list-house-dems-divided-on-iran-deal|title=The Hill’s Whip List: House Dems divided on Iran deal}}</ref>
