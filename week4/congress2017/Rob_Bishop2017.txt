==Early life, education, and early career==
Bishop was born in [[Kaysville, Utah|Kaysville]], [[Utah]] and graduated from [http://www.davis.k12.ut.us/Domain/7528 Davis High School]. He served as a [[Mormon missionary]] in [[Germany]] from 1970 until 1972. Bishop received a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]] from the [[University of Utah]] in [[Salt Lake City]] in 1974.  He taught civics classes at [[Brigham City, Utah|Brigham City]]'s [http://www.behs.besd.net/ Box Elder High School] from 1974 to 1980; he next taught [[German language|German]] in [[Ogden, Utah|Ogden]], Utah at [http://www.blhs.ogden.k12.ut.us/ Ben Lomond High School]; then he returned to teaching [[government]] and [[history]] classes at Box Elder High School until his retirement from teaching in 2002.<ref name=RobBishopBio>{{cite web|title=Rob Bishop Congressional Bio|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/Biography/}}</ref> While a teacher at Box Elder, Bishop partnered with the [[Close Up Foundation]] to help students participate in Close Up's [[Washington, D.C.]] based civic education programs. He remains actively involved in the program and works to ensure that Utah students have the opportunity to visit Washington, D.C.

==Early political career==
Bishop was a member of the [[Utah House of Representatives]] from 1978 to 1994.  He was House Majority Leader and later served as Speaker of the House from 1992 until 1994.  After his retirement from the state legislature, Bishop returned to Box Elder High School and taught [[Advanced Placement|advanced placement]] courses while chairing the history department.

In 1997 he was elected chairman of the [[Utah Republican Party]], and served for two terms in this position. He has also worked as a legislative lobbyist in Washington.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 2002, Bishop returned to politics when he ran for the Republican nomination in the 1st District.  22-year incumbent [[James V. Hansen|Jim Hansen]] had recently announced his retirement.  At the state Republican convention, he finished first in the seven-candidate field and went on to face State Representative [[Kevin Garn]] in a primary.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=217675</ref>  He defeated Garn in that primary with 59.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring him of being the next congressman from this heavily Republican district.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=27465</ref>   As expected, he won the general election with 61% of the vote. He has won re-election in 2004, 2006, 2008, 2010, and 2012 with even larger margins. In 2014, he was reelected with 64% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fahys|first1=Judy|title=Replican Bishop Returns to Congress in 1st District|url=http://kuer.org/post/republican-bishop-returns-congress-1st-district|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=KUER 90.1|publisher=NPR|date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

===Tenure===
As a teacher, he has made education related issues a top priority. He is a strong advocate for increased local control of schools.  He opposes [[No Child Left Behind]] and supports [[school vouchers]]. He was also a co-sponsor of a proposed amendment to guarantee a balanced federal budget.

From 2008â€“2010 Bishop served as Chairman of the [[Congressional Western Caucus]], where he advocated for multiple use of public lands and the need for fewer restrictions and mandates that limit use.

In May 2010 Bishop joined with other conservative House members to launch the 10th Amendment Task Force.  The Task Force aims to educate Congress and the public about the concept of [[Federalism in the United States|Federalism]].

As a [[Member of Congress]], Bishop has introduced legislation to increase domestic energy production in the United States, such as the 3-D energy bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://vitter.senate.gov/public/index.cfm?FuseAction=PressRoom.PressReleases&ContentRecord_id=0d2fa4cb-d070-30a2-9b68-20822d50d0e5|title=Vitter, Bishop Introduce Bicameral 3D Act|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=31 March 2011}}</ref> Ever a proponent of [[Multiple use]] parks over single use parks, he leveraged his position as Chairman of the Subcommittee over National Parks, Forests and Public Lands to stop the Department of Interior from designating areas as new de facto wilderness areas known as Wild Lands.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=244124|title=Bishop Responds to DOI Memo Calling for a Halt on Wild Lands Designations}}</ref>

In February 2011, Bishop introduced an amendment during the debate on a continuing [[budget resolution]] for fiscal year 2011 that would have prohibited the [[Bureau of Land Management]] (BLM) from spending federal funds on the [[National Landscape Conservation System]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=225394|title=Bishop Introduces Amendment to Defund National Landscape Conservation System|date=16 February 2011|accessdate=5 July 2011}}</ref> After coming under fire for introducing this amendment,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.deseretnews.com/article/705366847/Groups-blast-Bishop-over-gutting-landscape-conservation.html|title=Groups blast Bishop over 'gutting' landscape conservation|accessdate=5 July 2011|date=16 February 2011|publisher=Deseret News}}</ref> Bishop withdrew it before the continuing budget resolution was voted on.

In mid-2011, after touring of the U.S. Mexico border, Bishop led the charge on introducing a border security bill, H.R. 1505 the National Security and Federal Lands Protection Act. This bill gives the U.S. Border Patrol the authority to override specific environmental laws in order to allow the U.S. Border Patrol greater access to some of the most highly trafficked areas along the border. U.S. Border Patrol agents have cited that their efforts to address rampant criminal activity along the border have been hampered by [http://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/story/2011-10-27/border-patrol-environmental-laws/50952930/1 environmental laws]. The bill passed the House Natural Resources Committee and has not yet been brought before the full U.S. House of Representatives for a vote.

Similarly, Bishop co-sponsored a bill put forth by House Majority whip [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] to remove regulations from {{convert|43|e6acre|km2}} of Forest Service Roadless Areas and Wilderness Study Areas to multiple use purposes.

Well known for his fashionable three piece suits, Bishop was named the third-best-dressed congressmen in 2012 according to the Washingtonian.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Thomas|title=News roundup: Bishop third-best dressed in Congress|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogsoutofcontext/55369233-64/congress-obama-rep-romney.html.csp|accessdate=2012-12-27|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=November 29, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, Bishop announced the establishment of the Utah Public Lands Initiative.<ref name="Businesses, council respond to Public Lands Initiative">{{cite news|last=Millis|first=Kristin|title=Managing Editor|url=http://www.moabsunnews.com/news/article_d744265e-c22c-11e2-ae84-0019bb30f31a.html|accessdate=April 28, 2014|newspaper=Moab Sun News|date=May 22, 2013}}</ref> According to a staff report<ref name="PLI Staff Report">{{cite web|title=Public Lands Initiative Staff Report|url=http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf|work=Staff Report|publisher=Offices of Rob Bishop, Jason Chaffetz, and Chris Stewart|accessdate=April 28, 2014}}</ref> prepared by the offices of Bishop, [[Jason Chaffetz]], and [[Chris Stewart (politician)|Chris Stewart]], the Utah Public Lands Initiative is a locally driven initiative to bring resolution to some of the most challenging land disputes in the State of Utah. The initiative is rooted in the believe that conservation and economic development can coexist to make Utah a better place to live, work, and visit.<ref>http://robbishop.house.gov/uploadedfiles/pli_staff_report_112013.pdf</ref>

In February 2014 House Natural Resources Committee Chairman Doc Hastings announced that he will retire at the close of the 113th Congress.<ref name="Rep. Doc Hastings (R-Wash) to retire">{{cite news|last=Blake|first=Aaron|title=Author|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/13/rep-doc-hastings-r-wash-to-retire/|accessdate=February 13, 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=February 13, 2014}}</ref> Bishop, rumored to be a top contender for the Chairmanship,<ref name="Bishop rumored to be under consideration for Chairmanship">{{cite news|last=Burr|first=Thomas|title=Author|url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/politics/57682376-90/bishop-chaffetz-chairman-chairmanships.html.csp|accessdate=March 17, 2014|newspaper=Salt Lake Tribune|date=March 17, 2014}}</ref> was named to succeed him.

===Legislation===
On April 10, 2013, Bishop introduced the [[Ensuring Public Involvement in the Creation of National Monuments Act (H.R. 1459; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would amend the [[Antiquities Act of 1906]] to subject [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] declarations by the President to the [[National Environmental Policy Act of 1969]] (NEPA).<ref name=1459sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1459 â€“ Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1459|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref> At present, the [[President of the United States]] can unilaterally declare something a national monument, whereas the [[United States Congress]] is required to follow a more rigorous series of procedures to gather input from the public.<ref name=IBTjohanson>{{cite news|last=Johanson|first=Mark|title=GOP Bill Could Mean 'No More National Parks,' Public Land Advocates Warn|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/gop-bill-could-mean-no-more-national-parks-public-land-advocates-warn-1563152|accessdate=24 March 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=24 March 2014}}</ref>

In addition to limiting the number of national monument declarations the president could make, the bill would forbid the government from declaring land belonging to a private owner as a national monument without the private owner's consent.<ref name="1459sum"/> Bishop argued that "the American people deserve the opportunity to participate in land-use decisions regardless of whether they are made in Congress or by the President". He claims his new bill would ensure "that new national monuments are created openly with consideration of public input".<ref name="IBTjohanson"/>
