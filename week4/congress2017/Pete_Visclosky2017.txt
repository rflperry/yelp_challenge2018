'''Peter John "Pete" Visclosky''' (born August 13, 1949) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IN|1}}, serving since 1985. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the dean of the [[United States congressional delegations from Indiana|Indiana congressional delegation]]. The District lies in Northwest [[Indiana]]. Redistricting passed by the Indiana General Assembly in 2011 changed the district's boundaries, effective January 2013, to include all of Lake and Porter counties as well as the western and northwestern townships of LaPorte County, while shifting Benton, Newton, and Jasper counties out of the district. Much of the population is based in the [[Chicago Metropolitan Area]].

==Early life, education, and pre-congressional career==
Visclosky was born in Gary, Indiana, the son of John and the late Helen (née Kauzlaric) Visclosky. He is of Croatian-Slovak descent.<ref>http://svu2000.org/cs_america/legislators.htm U.S. legislators
with Czech-Slovak roots at ''Czechoslovak Society of Arts and Sciences.''</ref> He was educated at [[Andrean High School]] in [[Merrillville, Indiana]]. He earned a Bachelor of Science in Accounting at [[Indiana University Northwest]] in [[Gary, Indiana]] and went on to earn his [[juris doctor]] from [[Notre Dame Law School]]. At [[Georgetown University]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], Visclosky earned a Master of Laws in International and Comparative Law. He worked as a lawyer and staff member of United States Representative [[Adam Benjamin, Jr.|Adam Benjamin]] before entering the House.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1984, Visclosky ran for Congress in [[Indiana's 1st congressional district]].

For the rest of his career, he has never won a primary with less than 71% and he has only once won a general election with less than 60% of the vote - in 2010, when Republicans re-took control of the House of Representatives.

===Tenure===
Visclosky is pro-union<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/peter-visclosky-in/ Indiana District 1: Rep. Peter Visclosky (D)] ''[[National Journal]]''</ref> and anti-free trade.<ref>[http://visclosky.house.gov/press-release/visclosky-statement-opposition-free-trade-agreements Visclosky Statement in Opposition to Free Trade Agreements] October 11, 2011</ref>  Reinstating the steel tariff and fighting to save American manufacturing jobs have long been priorities of Visclosky.  He served as Chair of the Congressional Steel Caucus when the Democrats had control of the House, and currently serves as the Vice Chair.  He is also a former Chair of the Energy and Water Development Subcommittee and the current Ranking Member.

Visclosky is one of the 126 Democrats who voted against the [[Iraq War Resolution]]. He also is a supporter of high tech solutions as a way to revive the American blue collar work force, and as a way to decrease crime.

;PMA Group investigation
The ''[[Washington Times]]'' reported in March 2009 that Visclosky had received, over ten years, $1.36 million in campaign donations from clients of the [[PMA Group]].  In 2007 and 2008, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]], of which Visclosky is a member, directed $137 million in government purchasing to PMA's clients. In May 2009, Visclosky received subpoenas in the [[grand jury]] investigation into PMA Group, the first member of Congress to be subpoenaed in the investigation.<ref>Bendavid, Naftali and Davis, Susan, "[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124362015474866997.html?mod=googlenews_wsj Indiana Congressman Receives Subpoena in Lobbying Probe]", ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', May 29, 2009.</ref> The Congressman was later cleared of all charges by the [[House Ethics Committee]], who detailed in a 305-page report that "Simply because a member sponsors an earmark for an entity that also happens to be a campaign contributor does not, on these two facts alone, support a claim that a member's actions are being influenced by campaign contributions".<ref name="bloomberg">{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/85636792.html |title=Ethics panel clears Murtha on donations |last=Salant |first=Jonathan |date=February 27, 2010 |publisher=Bloomberg News |accessdate=March 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100302141857/http://www.philly.com/inquirer/world_us/85636792.html |archivedate=March 2, 2010 }}</ref>

In 2011, the House Ethics Committee ended its investigation, clearing Visclosky and Republican former Representative [[Todd Tiarht]] of Kansas.  While “PMA’s lobbyists pushed or directed company executives to maximize personal or Political Action Committee (PAC) campaign contributions and to attend specific fundraisers while pursuing earmarks,” the report notes, “the evidence did not show that Members or their official staff were included in discussions or correspondence about, coordinated with PMA on, or knew of these strategies.” <ref>[http://www.publicintegrity.org/2010/02/26/2722/house-ethics-panel-clears-murtha-method-representatives House ethics panel clears 'Murtha Method' representatives | The Center for Public Integrity<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>
