Meeks is pro-choice on abortion, and he supported [[Planned Parenthood]] all throughout his career. His votes, such as voting against the prohibition of late-term or partial birth abortions, twice in 2003 against the Republicans, support and strengthen his position on abortion. However, in the recent 2008 election for funding federal money to abortions, he voted against it.<ref name="votesmart1">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=4360 |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Gregory W.

Meeks is not supported by the Americans for Fair Taxation, which wants to the change the tax system, so a clean slate is given to every American and he or she is taxed equally by using retail sales tax. However, this would banish Social Security, Medicare and other government-supported plans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=4701 |title=Project Vote Smart - Americans for Fair Taxation Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Also, the National Taxpayers Union does not support Meeks.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_detail.php?r_id=4410 |title=Project Vote Smart - National Taxpayers Union Rating |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>—the National Taxpayers Union strives to change the current tax system to make it simpler to the individual<ref>{{cite web|title=A Taxing Trend: The Rise in Complexity, Forms, and Paperwork Burdens - NTU Policy Paper 128|url=http://www.ntu.org/news-and-issues/taxes/tax-reform/complexity.html|work=NTU - National Taxpayers Union|publisher=National Taxpayers Union|accessdate=28 June 2012|author=David Keating|date=18 April 2011}}</ref> Similarly, he is not supported by the National Tax Limitation Committee and Americans for Tax Reform, which have supported more Republicans than Democrats.{{clarify|date=June 2012}} None of these groups have overwhelmingly supported Gregory Meeks since he has been a representative of New York.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=4360 |title=Project Vote Smart - Representative Gregory W.

==Philippine visit==
On August 25, 2007, [[Silvestre Reyes]], chairman of the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]], and four other US Congressmen visited American troops deployed in the southern [[Philippines]], to overview the US-Philippines relationship. Reyes headed the bipartisan delegation which included [[New Jersey]] Rep. [[Rodney P. Frelinghuysen]], member of appropriations committee and the select intelligence oversight panel; [[New Mexico]] Rep. [[Heather Wilson]] of the committee on energy and the intelligence committee; [[New York (state)|New York]] Rep. Gregory W. Meeks, a Democrat, of the financial services and international relations committees; and [[Maryland]] Rep. [[Dutch Ruppersberger]] of the appropriations and intelligence committees. They drove to the base of the Joint Special Operation Task Force Philippines (JSOTFP), a US-led body, which trains Filipino soldiers against terror, in Barangay Upper Calarian.<ref>{{cite news|title=‘Dindo’ will hit N.

==Letter to Tirofijo==
On December 20, 2007, together with two other US representatives ([[Bill Delahunt]] and [[Jim McGovern (American politician)|Jim McGovern]]), Meeks wrote a letter thanking the head of the leftist Colombian guerilla organization [[FARC]] (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia, in Spanish) for the release of evidence that confirmed the survival of several of the forty-five hostages that the terrorist groups held captive (including three US citizens), some of them for over a decade. The group is considered a terrorist organization by the US government and the European Union (EU).

==Congressional Auto Lease==
It was recently noted by the ''New York Times'' that Meeks utilizes the option to use tax dollars to lease a car, for use as a member of Congress. This option does not exist for Senate members. The lease is forgone by many members of Congress, but Meeks has held the most-expensive lease among all members. He has used tax dollars to lease a 2007 [[Lexus LS]] 460, at $998 per month. Meeks was unwilling to provide further comment when questioned by the ''New York Times'', on the lease arrangement, saying, "These are never lighthearted stories." <ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/05/01/nyregion/01cars.html | work=The New York Times | title=What Would You Drive, if the Taxpayers Paid? | first=Raymond | last=Hernandez | date=2008-05-01}}</ref>

==2008 House Primary election==
Meeks was criticized for initially supporting [[Hillary Clinton]] over [[Barack Obama]] for President. His House primary election challenger was to be [[Ruben Wills]], a former chief of staff for State Senator [[Shirley L. Huntley]] and an organizer for Obama. Wills said, "I was on board with Obama from Day 1; Meeks had to be dragged across the line." Some suggested that a young black political class was seeking to assert the neighborhood’s power against what it saw as an older establishment, based in Harlem, that had long exercised disproportionate influence in [[New York City]].<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/01/us/politics/01dems.html?ref=politics | work=The New York Times | title=A New Campaign Charge: You Supported Clinton | first=Raymond | last=Hernandez | date=2008-07-01}}</ref><ref>[http://www.qgazette.com/news/2008/0716/political_page/014.html Obama Forces Back Challenges To Meeks In SE Queens Primary | www.qgazette.com | Queens Gazette<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Wills did not qualify for the ballot, resulting in no primary election taking place.
