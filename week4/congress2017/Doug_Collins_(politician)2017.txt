===2012 election===
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Georgia, 2012}}
In 2012, Collins ran for Congress in the redrawn [[Georgia's 9th congressional district|9th congressional district]].  (The district's incumbent, [[Tom Graves]], opted to run in the newly created 14th district, where his home was located.) Collins faced local media personality [[Martha Zoller]] and retired principal Roger Fitzpatrick in the Republican primary. The 9th is the most Republican district in the [[Eastern Time Zone]], with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+27. It was understood that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next representative in Congress.

Collins finished first in the primary with 42 percent of the total, but just 700 votes ahead of Zoller. Because neither had a majority, a runoff was held on August 21, 2012, and Collins defeated Zoller in that contest 55 percent to 45 percent.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=773474</ref><ref name="103.5">{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=David|title=Doug Collins Wins Republican Run-Off for Georgia’s 9th Congressional District|url=http://wsgcradio.com/doug-collins-wins-republican-run-off-for-georgias-9th-congressional-district/|publisher=103.5 WSGC|accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref> In the general election, he defeated Democrat Jody Cooley 76 percent to 24 percent.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=753471</ref><ref name="Independent Mail">{{cite web|last=Bynum|first=Ross|title=Doug Collins defeats opponent in Georgia race for U.S. House seat|url=http://www.independentmail.com/news/2012/aug/21/doug-collins-defeats-opponent-georgia-race-us-hous/|work=The Independent Mail (Anderson, SC)|accessdate=17 September 2012}}</ref>
