;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2012#District 27}}
[[Redistricting]] after the 2010 census made Farenthold's district significantly more Republican. His old district had been 70 percent Latino, but the new map shifted most of the Latino areas to the newly created 34th district.  To make up for the loss in population, his district was shifted well to the north and east, absorbing some heavily Republican territory near [[Houston, Texas|Houston]] and [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].

He defeated Democratic nominee Rose Meza Harrison 57-39 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108172637/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |archivedate=2006-11-08 |df= }}</ref>
