{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2010#District 7}}
Long joined the race for the 7th Congressional District after incumbent [[U.S. Representative]] [[Roy Blunt]] chose to run for the [[U.S. Senate]] seat that was being vacated by [[Kit Bond]]. In the crowded seven-way Republican primary—the ''de facto'' real election in the most Republican district in the state—Long narrowly won with 36 percent of the vote.
