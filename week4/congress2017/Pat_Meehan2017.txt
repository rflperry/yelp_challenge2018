'''Patrick Leo "Pat" Meehan''' (born October 20, 1955) is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] member of the [[United States House of Representatives]], representing {{ushr|PA|7}} since January 3, 2011. The district includes parts of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]], [[Chester County, Pennsylvania|Chester]], and [[Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Montgomery Counties]]. He succeeded [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Joe Sestak]], who ran unsuccessfully for the [[United States Senate]].

Meehan sits on the Transportation and Infrastructure, Oversight and Government Reform, and Homeland Security Committees. On the Homeland Security Committee, Meehan chairs the Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies.

A graduate of [[Bowdoin College]] and [[Temple University]], Meehan previously served as [[United States Attorney]] for the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|Eastern District of Pennsylvania]] (2001–2008) and as [[district attorney]] of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania]] (1996–2001).

==Early life and education==
Born and raised in [[Cheltenham Township, Pennsylvania]] by his parents Leo and Julia, Meehan is one of four siblings. He attended [[Bowdoin College]] in Maine, graduating in 1978 with a Bachelor of Arts degree. While at Bowdoin, Meehan was a standout hockey player and went on to work as a [[National Hockey League]] referee from 1979 to 1982.<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=Barone |first2=Chuck |last1=McCutcheon|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref> Meehan attended [[Temple Law School]] in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], and graduated with his Juris Doctor (J.D.) in 1986.

==Private law practice==
After graduating from law school in 1986, Meehan went to work as an associate at the law firm Dilworth Paxson LLP. On July 7, 2008, Meehan stepped down from his position. On July 16, 2008, Meehan announced that he was joining the Philadelphia law firm of Conrad O'Brien Gellman & Rohn.<ref>[http://www.philly.com/philly/hp/news_update/20080707_U_S__Attorney_Pat_Meehan_to_step_down.html U.S. Attorney Pat Meehan to step down] Philadelphia Inquirer – Mon, Jul. 7, 2008 by Emilie Lounsberry. Accessed July 7, 2008 11:23 AM</ref>

==Early political career==
Meehan’s career in public service and politics began in 1979 when he worked with Republican candidate [[David Marston]] on his Philadelphia mayoral campaign. A year later, he worked on [[Leroy S. Zimmerman|Roy Zimmerman]]'s campaign for [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]].

Meehan went on to serve as Special Counsel to U.S. Senator [[Arlen Specter]]. He was a campaign manager for U.S. Senator [[Rick Santorum]], Philadelphia D.A. [[Ronald D. Castille|Ron Castille]], and [[Pennsylvania Attorney General|State Attorney General]] [[Ernie Preate]].<ref name="ReferenceA">Joseph A. Slobozian, "A decisive, focused style from new U.S. attorney." ''Philadelphia Inquirer''. 9/15/2001; Pg. B01</ref>

==District Attorney (1996–2001)==
In 1995, Meehan was elected the District Attorney of [[Delaware County, Pennsylvania|Delaware County]] as a Republican. During Meehan's tenure, his staff prosecuted several high-profile cases, including the ''Du Pont Murder Trial'', (a case involving the murder of Olympic wrestler [[Dave Schultz (wrestling)|David Schultz]] by his millionaire benefactor [[John Eleuthère du Pont]]) and the 1996 murder of a 22-year-old college student named [[Aimee Willard]] (who was abducted from [[Interstate 476|Route 476]] and found in an abandoned lot in [[North Philadelphia]]).<ref name="ReferenceA"/>

While serving as District Attorney, Meehan set up the ''Special Victims Unit for Domestic Violence'' in Delaware County, offering victims protection from their alleged abusers by allowing the prosecution to occur without the victims testifying in open court.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=Danielle|title=Meehan, Badey square off in 7th Congressional District race|url=http://www.delcotimes.com/article/DC/20121028/NEWS/310289970|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=Daily Times News|date=October 28, 2012}}</ref> As D.A., he also focused on protecting youth by expanding the ''Youth Aid Panel'' program for first time offenders and creating a truancy project to limit youth-related crime during the day. Meehan established the [[United States Department of Justice]]’s ''Internet Crimes Against Children Task Force'' (ICAC) in Pennsylvania. The ICAC is a special unit of detectives who investigate online predators on the web and bring them to justice; it has become a model across the country.

==U.S. Attorney (2001–2008)==
Meehan became the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on September 17, 2001, six days after the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. He was appointed by President [[George W. Bush]] and confirmed by the United States Senate. Meehan headed an office of over 200 lawyers and staff backed up by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI), the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the U.S. Postal Inspection Service Office. As U.S. Attorney, Meehan made terrorism, gang-related crime, child internet safety, and public corruption priorities for his criminal division. Public corruption in Philadelphia in particular was brought to the spotlight in 2003 when a FBI electronic listening device was found in the Philadelphia Mayor’s office.

In light of the September 11 terrorist attacks, Meehan formed the Anti-Terrorism Task Force (ATTF), later renamed the Anti-Terrorism Advisory Council (ATAC) in the Eastern District of Pennsylvania to evaluate and prevent future terrorist attacks. This initiative was done in partnership with local, state and federal law enforcement and emergency responders. The ATAC has led large-scale exercises on biological attacks and the poisoning of the food supply in partnership with Saint Joseph’s University in order to help Eastern Pennsylvania prepare for terrorist attacks.<ref name="usdoj.gov">U.S. Attorney Patrick L. Meehan (Official Bio), Accessed 1/19/2008 http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/pae/usa.html</ref>{{Full citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Recognizing the expansion of gang-related activity in the eastern part of Pennsylvania, Meehan sought a $2.5 million dollar Department of Justice grant to fight and prevent gang violence for the region. The unique “Route 222 Corridor Anti-Gang Initiative” brought together elected officials and law enforcement personnel with community groups to fight gangs in a rural area unfamiliar with big-city gang violence. The money was divided among enforcement, prevention and rehabilitation. The program aimed not only to increase arrests, but also to fund school programs and community centers to educate youth about alternatives to gang life.<ref name="usdoj.gov"/>{{Full citation needed|date=April 2011}}

Continuing the work he began while he was Delaware County D.A., Meehan made child safety on the internet a priority, sponsoring internet safety training seminars with Web Wise Kids and visiting local schools. Meehan’s office prosecuted substandard nursing homes and elder care facilities, and nefarious lenders who offered ill-advised loans to disadvantaged homeowners. The U.S. Attorney’s Office under Meehan was nationally recognized for its work in the field of health-care fraud. The office won more than half a billion dollars in settlements against some of the largest pharmaceutical companies and pharmacy benefit managers, ensuring better self-policing and oversight by the industry.<ref>J.F. Pirro, "Justice Served (Straight Up)."

;Public corruption cases
Though he has been active in a wide variety of areas, it has been several high-profile public corruption cases that have put Meehan in the headlines.  Philadelphia is well known for its “pay to play” culture that rewards patronage rather than merit. Since taking office, Meehan and his office have been actively prosecuting corrupt Philadelphia city officials. Meehan has said, "Pay to play cannot be standard operating procedure in city government.<ref>Mark Fazlollah and Joseph Tanfani, "Probe reveals city's shadow government." Philadelphia Inquirer. 6/30/2004; Pg. A01.</ref>”

This was brought to national attention on October 7, 2003 when Philadelphia Police conducted a sweep of Mayor [[John F. Street]]’s office and found an electronic listening device. It was later discovered that the “bug” had been planted by the FBI as part of a city corruption investigation. Street was never charged in the investigation. Philadelphia officials and the mayor were outraged, especially with the timing coinciding with the Philadelphia mayoral election on November 4, 2003. Street’s campaign spokesman went so far as to accuse the federal government of attempting to influence the election (which Street ended up winning anyway).<ref>Nicole Weisensee Egan, "Meehan 'Plays It Straight'; U.S. Attorney Lauded As Man of Integrity." Philadelphia Daily News. 10/9/2003; Pg. 06</ref> Meehan was applauded in the press and in the city for his handling of the situation, which resulted in twelve indictments including that of Street confidant Ronald White (who died before he could stand trial) and city treasurer Corey Kemp, who was convicted and sentenced to ten years in federal prison.<ref>Michael Hinkelman, "5 guilty in City Hall corruption case appeal convictions."  Philadelphia Daily News. 6/6/2007. Pg. 06"</ref>

Other city officials prosecuted by Meehan’s office included former city councilman Rick Mariano (who was sentenced to six and a half years in federal prison for accepting bribes and attempting to influence city contracts), the President of the [[Independence Seaport Museum]] John S. Carter (who was sentenced to 15 years for cheating the museum out of $1.5 million), Montgomery County accountant Denis Shusterman (for embezzling $10 million, he received a 14-year sentence),<ref>John Shiffman, "Big jail time for museum cheat; John Carter." Philadelphia Inquirer. 11/3/2007.  Pg. A01</ref> and State Senator [[Vincent Fumo]] (who was convicted on a 139-count indictment including fraud, conspiracy and obstruction of justice charges carrying a ten-year sentence).<ref>Craig R. McCoy and John Shiffman, "The Case Against Fumo." Philadelphia Inquirer. 2/7/2007. State and Regional News</ref>

===Elections===
;2010
{{Main article|Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district election, 2010}}
{{See also|Pennsylvania gubernatorial election, 2010|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2010#District 7}}

Meehan began his campaign for Pennsylvania governor in 2008.<ref>http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/opinion/columnists/bumsted/s_577355.html</ref> On August 7, 2009, however, he announced that he was ending his exploratory bid and would instead run for Congress.  Reports indicated that another candidate, Pennsylvania Attorney General [[Tom Corbett]], was too far ahead of Meehan in fundraising and endorsements.<ref>http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/harrisburg_politics/Meehan_quits_governors_race.html</ref>

Meehan decided to run in Pennsylvania's 7th congressional district election, vacated by [[Joe Sestak]], who defeated [[U.S. Senator]] [[Arlen Specter]] in 2010 in the Democratic Party primary, but lost to Republican [[Pat Toomey]] in the general election. Meehan ran unopposed for the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nomination in the May 18, 2010 Republican primary.

To appear on the primary election ballot a candidate for Congress in Pennsylvania is required to collect valid signatures of 1,000 registered voters in the congressional district.  When evidence of fraud in some of Meehan's petitions was discovered by the Meehan campaign, Meehan alerted the Delaware County District Attorney. Michael Green, the District Attorney and Meehan supporter, turned over the matter to the office of the [[Pennsylvania Attorney General]].  Because the Attorney General, [[Tom Corbett]], is the Republican candidate for governor, Lentz requested that the [[United States Department of Justice]] take over the investigation.<ref>http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2010/04/02/news/doc4bb5576c406e2863018321.txt</ref>  Paul Summers, a Republican campaign operative and volunteer, was charged with seven counts of forgery and seven counts of making false signatures.<ref>http://www.attorneygeneral.gov/press.aspx?id=5942</ref> He was convicted on seven of the charges after pleading guilty as part of a plea-bargain deal.<ref>http://www.delcotimes.com/articles/2011/04/05/news/doc4d9a8e5935767035537575.txt?viewmode=fullstory</ref>

==Legislation==

Meehan introduced legislation, titled the 'Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013' (CIRDA), that passed the subcommittee on [[United States House Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection, and Security Technologies|Cybersecurity, Infrastructure Protection and Security Technologies]] in 2013. The bill aims to make key improvements in security for important infrastructure. The measure calls for expansion in research and development for security technology as well as implementing a new strategy in dealing with cyber threats that the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] faces. This bill would also streamline sharing of these technologies to many other branches of government, thus making them more secure as a whole.<ref>{{cite news|title=Bipartisan CIRDA Act passes subcommittee|url=http://riponadvance.com/news/bipartisan-cirda-act-passes-subcommittee/4867|accessdate=30 September 2013|newspaper=Ripon Advance|date=25 September 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Subcommittee Markup: H.R. 2952 CIRDA Act of 2013 and H.R. 3107 the Homeland Security Cybersecurity Boots-on-the-Ground Act|url=http://homeland.house.gov/markup/subcommittee-markup-hr-2952-cirda-act-2013-and-hr-homeland-security-cybersecurity-boots|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Homeland Security|accessdate=30 September 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Meehan introduced a bill called the [[Critical Infrastructure Research and Development Advancement Act of 2013 (H.R. 2952; 113th Congress)]]. If signed into law, the bill would require more oversight of the Department of Homeland Security's cybersecurity goals, according to ''Ripon Advance''.
