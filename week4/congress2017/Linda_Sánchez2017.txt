It's been documented. It's not mainstream politics."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/03/congresswoman-says-white-supremacist-groups-inspired-arizonas-immigration-law/?test=latestnews | work=Fox News | title=Congresswoman: White Supremacist Groups Behind Arizona Immigration Law | date=June 3, 2010}}</ref> Rep.

*Linda Sánchez, Loretta Sánchez and Richard Buskin, ''Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress'', Grand Central Publishing (September 2, 2008) ISBN 978-0-446-50804-9, foreword by [[Nancy Pelosi]]

Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoir—perhaps because these two women are not typical politicians."<ref>{{cite web |title=Nonfiction Reviews |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6567674.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013082230/http://www.publishersweekly.com/article/CA6567674.html |archive-date=October 13, 2008 |work=[[Publishers Weekly]] |date=June 9, 2008 |accessdate=October 22, 2015}}</ref>
