==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2012 election===
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 47}}
On November 6, 2012, Lowenthal was elected to the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] from the newly created [[California's 47th congressional district|47th District]] after defeating Republican [[Gary DeLong (politician)|Gary DeLong]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Saltzgaver|first=Harry|title=Lowenthal To Represent Long Beach In Congress|url=http://www.gazettes.com/news/government/lowenthal-to-represent-long-beach-in-congress/article_00f73b1c-2930-11e2-ad37-0019bb2963f4.html|work=gazettes.com|accessdate=7 November 2012}}</ref> Although DeLong carried the [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] portion of the district with 54 percent of the vote, Lowenthal swamped him in the [[Los Angeles County]] portion by over 38,000 votes, more than the actual margin of 30,100 votes.
