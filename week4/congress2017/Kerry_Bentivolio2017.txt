==Political career==

===2010 State Senate election===
In 2010, Bentivolio ran for the [[Michigan Senate]] for the 15th District but was defeated by [[Mike Kowall]] in the primary.  During the election, Bentivolio acknowledged that he had filed for bankruptcy in 1992 after homes he had built as a commercial builder did not sell, and Bentivolio faced judgments from creditor's collection suits in the Michigan counties of Oakland and [[Livingston, Wisconsin|Livingston]].<ref name=DFP121014>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Kathleen|title=Kerry Bentivolio: From being Santa to long shot to front-runner for Congress|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20121014/NEWS15/310140156/Kerry-Bentivolio-From-being-Santa-to-long-shot-to-front-runner-for-Congress|work=Detroit Free Press|publisher=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=14 October 2012}}</ref>  Bentivolio also acknowledged having been involved in a lawsuit involving one of the creditors to whom he had owed money at that time; Bentivolio had started a new business doing [[Santa Claus]] appearances, and had obtained an appearance at the White House during the presidency of [[George H. W. Bush]].  Bentivolio called a news conference in Milford, whereupon the creditor complained and newspapers reported on the bankruptcy story.  Bentivolio sued the vendor and several newspapers for slander and libel.<ref name=DFP121014/>

===2012 Congressional elections===
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2012#District 11}}
In 2011, Bentivolio announced his candidacy for [[Michigan's 11th congressional district]] seat in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] and was considered a long-shot to defeat incumbent [[Thaddeus McCotter]] for the Republican nomination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bentivolioforcongress.com/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=92|title=Bentivolio for U.S. Congress|publisher=|date=|accessdate=2012-05-26}}</ref> However, Bentivolio's campaign was aided by reports that McCotter failed to qualify for the primary after failing to turn in the required minimum number of signatures to be on the ballot.<ref>{{cite web|last=Eggert|first=David|title=Thad McCotter shocker: Congressman's lack of ballot signatures endangers 11th district seat for Republicans|url=http://www.mlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2012/05/thad_mccotter_may_not_get_on_b.html|publisher=http://www.mlive.com|accessdate=30 March 2013}}</ref> McCotter's campaign released a statement on May 25, 2012 conceding that there were not enough valid signatures turned in with his ballot petition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20120810/NEWS15/120810028/Thaddeus-McCotter-congressional-staff|title=3 former McCotter congressional aides arraigned on election fraud charges|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/document/pub?id=1lctWKXrdMxxnWDFWmTYStxQXaYWeWzHSFa-ubgP7iG0|title=U.S. Rep.

Although McCotter initially announced he would mount a write-in campaign for the seat, he opted to retire at the end of his term. However, McCotter unexpectedly resigned on July 6, 2012, causing a scramble for the vacant nomination.  Bentivolio faced former state senator [[Nancy Cassis]], a write-in candidate, for the district's Republican primary.  Cassis and her supporters drew attention to the 2011 film ''The President Goes to Heaven'' in which Bentivolio had a prominent role as a doctor tending to a fictional president resembling [[George W. Bush]].<ref name="Payne">http://apps.detnews.com/apps/blogs/watercooler/index.php?blogid=5243</ref><ref name=KGrayDFP>{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Kathleen|title=GOP hopeful Kerry Bentivolio makes fun of Bush-like character in movie|url=http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:aIKLBYGsiMEJ:www.centralohio.com/article/C4/20120716/NEWS15/207160368/GOP-hopeful-Kerry-Bentivolio-makes-fun-of-Bush-like-character-in-movie+&cd=1&hl=en&ct=clnk&gl=us|accessdate=2 October 2012|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=16 July 2012}}</ref>  In the movie, a fictional president instigates the September 11, 2001 attacks in a plot to justify the invasion of Iraq, but cannot get to heaven until he converts to [[Islam]].<ref name="Payne" /><ref name=KGrayDFP />  Bentivolio pointed out the film was a work of fiction.<ref name=KGrayDFP />  On August 7, 2012, Bentivolio defeated Cassis and won the district's Republican nomination, pitting him against [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Syed Taj]], a physician, in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2012#District 11|November 6, 2012 election]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.hometownlife.com/article/20120809/NEWS12/208090426|title=Bentivolio wins Republican nomination in 11th congressional district|publisher=Observer and Eccentric Newspapers|date=August 10, 2012|accessdate=2012-08-11}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Henderson|first=Stephen|title=Stephen Henderson: Candidate Bentivolio can run, but can he hide?|url=http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=2012120822061|accessdate=26 August 2012|newspaper=The Detroit Free Press|date=August 22, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20120607/NEWS03/120607047/Nancy-Cassis-Thad-McCotter-Republican-seat-write-in?odyssey=tab%7ctopnews%7ctext%7cFRONTPAGE|title=Local GOP leaders vote to support former state senator Nancy Cassis to replace Thad McCotter|work=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=18 August 2015}}</ref>

On November 6, 2012, Bentivolio lost the special election for the remaining months of McCotter's term in 112th Congress to [[David Curson]], but won the general election and became representative-elect for the 11th Congressional District.

===2014 Congressional election===
Bentivolio faced an August 5, 2014 Republican Primary challenge for the [[Michigan's 11th congressional district]] seat from lawyer [[David Trott]] who announced his bid on September 4, 2013. He was defeated by Trott in the primary, making him the third incumbent defeated in a Republican primary in 2014. He will serve out the rest of his term.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Abby|title=Michigan Primary Results: GOP Congressman Defeated|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/michigan-primary-results-republican-congressman-defeated/?dcz=emailalert|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=6 August 2014}}</ref>  However,  Congressman Bentivolio mounted what ''The Hill'' described as a lackluster write-in campaign for the November 2014 election to continue serving in his seat.<ref>{{cite web|title=Accidental Congressman loses seat in Michigan|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/222923-gops-trott-wins-seat-occupied-by-accidental-congressman|website=The Hill|accessdate=20 November 2014}}</ref>

Bentivolio finished the general election behind Trott, Democratic challenger, Bobby McKenzie, and Libertarian candidate John Tatar, and will relinquish his seat in January.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Lynch|first1=John|title=Trott defeats McKenzie in 11th District|url=http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/elections/2014/11/04/michigan-congress-eleventh-district-election-results/18491161/|accessdate=20 November 2014|agency=The Detroit News|date=5 November 2014}}</ref>

A May 20–22 poll of likely Republican primary voters run by Target Insyght and commissioned by MIRS (Michigan Information & Research Service, Inc.) showed Rep.

A July 12–13 poll commissioned by the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' and [[WXYZ-TV]] indicated that Bentivolio's support had dropped considerably in the face of a strong media barrage from the Trott campaign; Trott led in the poll of likely Republican primary voters 53%–31%, with 16% undecided.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.freep.com/article/20140715/NEWS06/307150144/Trott-Bentivolio-Congress-election-primary-poll |title=Trott holds 22-point lead on Bentivolio, poll says |publisher=''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' |last=Spangler |first=Todd |date=July 15, 2014 |accessdate=July 21, 2014}}</ref>

After his defeat, Bentivolio announced that he was running a write-in campaign. He alleged that after Trott won the primary, the Trott campaign "kept up the attacks, but they expanded it beyond me. After they won the race, they continued to beat up me, my family members, as well as my staff... I put them on notice: If they didn't stop I'm probably going to end up doing a write-in campaign. And they didn't stop." The Trott campaign has denied this, saying that "nothing like that occurred." Bentivolio does not think he will win, or even "get enough votes to keep [Trott] from getting elected... all I'm concerned about is getting people who want a voice through a protest vote to do a protest vote."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/elections-2014-kerry-bentivolio-write-in-campaign |title=Kerry Bentivolio to Wage Write-In Campaign |publisher=Roll Call |date=October 2, 2014 |accessdate=October 3, 2014}}</ref>
