==Legal career==
Gowdy served as clerk for John P. Gardner on the [[South Carolina Court of Appeals]] as well as for United States District Court Judge [[George Ross Anderson, Jr.]]. He then went into private practice before being selected as a U.S. federal prosecutor in April 1994. Gowdy would later be awarded the Postal Inspector’s Award for the successful prosecution of J. Mark Allen, one of “[[America’s Most Wanted]]” suspects.

In February 2000, he left the United States Attorney’s Office to run for 7th Circuit Solicitor. He defeated incumbent Solicitor Holman Gossett<ref>{{cite news|last=Spencer |first=Janet S. |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=_AcoAAAAIBAJ&sjid=288EAAAAIBAJ&pg=3122,6036649&dq=trey+gowdy&hl=en |title=Gowdy spins web campaign |publisher=Herald-Journal |date=April 29, 2000 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> in the Republican primary. He ran unopposed in the general election. Gowdy was reelected in 2004 and 2008, both times unopposed. During his tenure, he appeared in two episodes of "[[Forensic Files]]," as well as [[Dateline NBC]] and [[South Carolina Educational Television|SCETV]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.treygowdy.com/meet-trey/ |title=Meet Trey |publisher=Trey Gowdy |accessdate=May 9, 2012}} {{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref> He prosecuted the full set of criminal cases, including seven death penalty cases.

When the state faced a budget crunch that forced many employees to go on unpaid furloughs, Gowdy funneled part of his campaign account into the solicitor's budget so his staff could keep working.<ref name=CQ>[http://innovation.cq.com/newmember/2010elexnguide.pdf Congressional Quarterly Guide to the New Congress], 2010 {{dead link|date=July 2016}}</ref>

==Congress==

===2010===
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2010#District 4*}}
In the summer of 2009, Gowdy announced that he would challenge incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Bob Inglis]] in the Republican primary for {{ushr|South Carolina|4}}.

Inglis, who got a 93% lifetime rating from the [[American Conservative Union]], angered the [[Conservativism in the United States|conservative wing of the Republican Party]] by taking stances that were perceived to be more moderate than those he'd taken when he'd first represented the district from 1993 to 1999, specifically and in large part regarding climate change.<ref name="pol090407">{{cite web |first=Josh |last=Kraushaar|title=Inglis faces fight from the right |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0409/20974.html|work=[[Politico.com]]|date=April 7, 2009|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}</ref> He drew five Republican challengers, including Gowdy. Like most of the challengers, Gowdy ran well to Inglis' right.<ref name="pol090407"/> In the June 2010 primary, Gowdy ranked first with 39% of the vote, short of the 50% majority threshold to win outright and avoid a run-off. Inglis received 27% of the vote. Jim Lee got 14%, State Senator [[David L. Thomas]] got 13%, and former [[Historian of the United States House of Representatives]] [[Christina Jeffrey]] was last with 7% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=487675 |title=SC District 4 – R Primary Race |publisher=Our Campaigns |date=June 8, 2010 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref><ref>McArdle, John.

===2012===
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in South Carolina, 2012 #District 4}}
Gowdy ran for reelection to a second term against Democrat Deb Morrow.<ref>[http://taylors.patch.com/articles/deb-morrow-seeks-democratic-nod-for-congress ]{{dead link|date=August 2014}}</ref> In the wake of the 2010 census, the redrawing of the district amended and cut sizable portions out of Gowdy's home county of Spartanburg County out of the district, while leaving all of Greenville County within the district. Gowdy was initially quoted as being "disappointed" with the version, despite the plan leaving the 4th district relatively a Republican stronghold. Regardless, the last and final map moved a portion of Greenville County to the 3rd district; and left all of Spartanburg County in the 4th district. Gowdy was quoted as being "pleased" with this version, as Greenville and Spartanburg counties remained linked. [[Roll Call (newspaper)|Roll Call]] rated his district as ''Safe Republican'' in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|last=Miller |first=Joshua |url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_18/Race-Ratings-GOP-Strengthens-Grip-on-South-Carolina-207940-1.html |title=Race Ratings: GOP Strengthens Grip on South Carolina |publisher=Roll Call |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> Gowdy would later win re-election to a second term in 2014.

===2014===

===2016===
In the November 2016 election, Gowdy faced Democrat Chris Fedalei, a  26-year-old attorney. Trey Gowdy easily defeated Chris Fedalei with 67.23% of the vote to retain his seat.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.goupstate.com/article/20160304/ARTICLES/160309856 |title=Spartanburg native Chris Fedalei to challenge Gowdy |author=Chris Lavender |date=March 4, 2016 |accessdate=July 24, 2016}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Tenure===
In August 2011 during the [[2011 United States debt ceiling crisis]], Gowdy opposed Speaker [[John Boehner]]’s debt limit bill, and he voted against the final debt ceiling agreement.<ref name="More from Boehner">{{cite news|last=Sherman|first=Jake|title=Right wants more from John Boehner|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0512/76258.html|accessdate=June 2, 2012|newspaper=Politico|date=May 13, 2012}}</ref>  He also opposed the 2011 defense authorization bill, citing concerns about the prospect of Americans being detained without trial on national security grounds.<ref>{{cite web|last=Brady |first=Jessica |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/detainee_provisions_still_cause_concern-211283-1.html |title=Detainee Provisions Still Cause for Concern |publisher=Roll Call |date=December 29, 2011 |accessdate=May 9, 2012}}</ref> In December 2010, he told [[Congressional Quarterly]] that he would support a measure only if its sponsor could demonstrate that the Constitution gave the government the power to act in a particular realm.<ref name=CQ/>

Gowdy worked on the Committee on Judiciary, the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform, and the Committee on Education and the Workforce. Gowdy frequently speaks on the floor of the House on issues ranging from [[ATF gunwalking scandal|Operation Fast and Furious]] to his support for the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act.

In 2012, he received the ''Defender of Economic Freedom'' award from the fiscally conservative [[501(c) organization|501(c)4]] organization [[Club for Growth]]. The award is given to the members of Congress who have the year's highest ranking, according to the Club for Growth's metrics. Gowdy scored 97 out of 100, and was one of 34 congressmen given the award.<ref>{{cite web|last=Drury |first=Shawn |url=http://mauldin.patch.com/articles/rep-trey-gowdy-awarded-by-club-for-growth |title=Rep.

An ardent social conservative, Gowdy considers himself "pro-life plus." He not only believes "in the sanctity of life," but argues that "the strategy should be broader than waiting for the Supreme Court to revisit ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''."<ref name="Gowdy Issues">{{cite web|title=Issues|url=http://www.treygowdy.com/issues/|publisher=Gowdy For Congress|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>

Trey Gowdy signed the Contract From America, which aims to defund, repeal, and replace the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], limit [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] regulations, enact a reform of the federal tax code, pass a [[balanced budget amendment]], and end [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]].<ref name=Contract>{{cite web|title=Contract From America|url=http://www.thecontract.org/support/|publisher=Contract From America|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Gowdy positions">{{cite web|title=Project Vote Smart|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/121782/trey-gowdy/|publisher=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=May 29, 2012}}</ref>
