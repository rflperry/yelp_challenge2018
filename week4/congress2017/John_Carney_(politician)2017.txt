==Early political career==
Carney has served as Deputy Chief Administrative Officer of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] and as Secretary of Finance and Deputy Chief of Staff for Governor [[Tom Carper]].

==Lieutenant Governor of Delaware==
He was first elected Lieutenant Governor of Delaware in 2000 and served from January 16, 2001 until January 20, 2009.

As Lieutenant Governor Carney presided over the Delaware State Senate and chaired the Board of Pardons. He was chairman of the Delaware Health Care Commission, the Interagency Council on Adult Literacy, the Criminal Justice Council, the Center for Education Technology, and the Livable Delaware Advisory Council. In 2002 he launched the education initiative "Models of Excellence in Education" to identify practices in schools that have raised student achievement. Carney was also selected by other Lieutenant Governors as chairman of the National Lieutenant Governors Association from July 2004 to July 2005.

Carney has long been an advocate for wellness issues in Delaware, sponsoring "BeHealthy Delaware" and "The Lt. Governor's Challenge" to encourage Delawareans to be more active and address the State's high rate of chronic diseases. He fought for Delaware's public [[smoking ban]] to improve health, cut cancer rates, and discourage teens from starting to smoke.

After completing his tenure as Lieutenant Governor in 2009, Carney served as president and chief operating officer of Transformative Technologies, which is investing in the DelaWind project, to bring offshore wind turbine construction to Delaware.<ref>[http://www.sussexcountian.com/news/x1017430518/Carney-to-join-energy-firm-after-leaving-office Sussex Countian, 1/8/09: "Carney to join energy firm after leaving office"]</ref> He planned to step down in early 2010 to concentrate on his U.S. House campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tommywonk.com/2009/10/john-carney-and-delawind.html|title=TommyWonk|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>

{{See also|Delaware gubernatorial election, 2008}}
Carney sought the Democratic nomination for the office of Governor in 2008, as incumbent Governor [[Ruth Ann Minner]] was constitutionally barred from seeking a third term.  However, despite the backing of most of the party establishment, Carney lost the Democratic primary by fewer than two thousand votes in a close race to State Treasurer [[Jack Markell]], who went on to win the general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/wires/2008Nov04/0,4670,DelawareGovernor,00.html|title=FoxNews.com - Breaking News - Latest News - Current News|publisher=|accessdate=20 May 2016}}</ref>

===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives election in Delaware, 2010}}
[[File:Johncarney-campaignevent.jpg|thumb|right|Carney at a campaign event, June 23, 2008]]
Carney was the Democratic Party nominee for Delaware's at-large seat in the [[United States House of Representatives]] in 2010. Carney faced Republican [[Glen Urquhart (Republican politician)|Glen Urquhart]], Independent Party of Delaware Earl R. Lofland, Libertarian Brent A. Wangen, and Blue Enigma Jeffrey Brown. The seat had been held since 1993 by Republican [[Michael Castle]], who declined to seek re-election to the House in order to run for the U.S. Senate seat once held by Vice President [[Joe Biden]]. In the first week of October, [[Fairleigh Dickinson University]]'s PublicMind Poll released the results of its opinion research, showing Carney with a 15-point advantage over Urquhart, 51%-36%; well ahead in New Castle County (56-32) but running even with Urquhart (43-43) in the downstate counties of Kent and Sussex.<ref>"Poll: Dem leads Republican in open Del. House seat," Huffington Post, Oct. 5, 2010. http://www.huffingtonpost.com/huff-wires/20101005/us-delaware-house-poll/</ref> Days before the election, a second Fairleigh Dickinson poll showed Carney leading by 17 percentage points, 53% to 36% among likely voters.<ref>"Rare Pickup in House for Democrats," Fairleigh Dickinson's PublicMind Poll, Oct. 29, 2010. http://publicmind.fdu.edu/carney/</ref>

Carney won the seat by 16 points, 57%-41%, and took office on January 3 of 2011. His victory was one of the three seats gained by the Democrats in a year where they suffered a net loss of 63 seats to the Republicans.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives election in Delaware, 2012}}
In his bid for a second term, Carney faced Republican [[Tom Kovach]], the President of [[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]], and two minor candidates. In a debate with Kovach, Carney stated, "I will continue to do in Washington what I did in Delaware: work across the aisle to get things done. I learned early on that compromise is part of life." Speaking on the [[Affordable Care Act]] (commonly called Obamacare), Carney stated that it "is not perfect" but that it is the "only chance we have to get costs under control."<ref>{{cite news|last=Mace|first=Ben|url=http://www.doverpost.com/article/20121016/NEWS/121019802?template=printart|title=Citizens protest; Pires calls Carper corrupt, unfit at Delaware debates|newspaper=The Dover Post|location=Dover, DE|date=October 16, 2012|accessdate=June 20, 2014}}</ref> Carney was re-elected in a landslide, with 64% of the vote to Kovach's 33%.

;2014
{{See also|United States House of Representatives election in Delaware, 2014}}
Carney ran for re-election to a third term in 2014. He defeated Republican Rose Izzo by 59% to 37%, with Green Bernie August and Libertarian Scott Gesty taking 2% each.

===Tenure===
In 2011, Carney and Illinois Republican [[Aaron Schock]] co-sponsored a bill that would use U.S. oil exploration to help fund a five-year federal highway construction project. The bill has not been voted on as of April 2012.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://thehill.com/blogs/transportation-report/highways-bridges-and-roads/197725-lawmakers-press-for-highway-bill-on-morning-joe|title=Lawmakers push for six-year highway bill| publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|date=December 7, 2011|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.pjstar.com/news/x58617011/Schock-transportation-bill-vote-could-come-next-month|title=Schock gathering support for highway bill| publisher=[[Journal Star (Peoria)|Journal Star]]|date=January 17, 2012|accessdate=April 11, 2012}}</ref>

On April 7, 2014, Carney introduced the [[Expatriate Health Coverage Clarification Act of 2014 (H.R. 4414; 113th Congress)]] into the House.<ref name=4414sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4414 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4414|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 April 2014}}</ref> The bill would exempt [[expatriate]] health care plans from the requirements of the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref name=bipartisanOcareTweak>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House to pass new, bipartisan ObamaCare tweak|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/healthcare/202951-house-to-pass-new-bipartisan-obamacare-tweak|accessdate=9 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=8 April 2014}}</ref> Carney argued that expatriates, a group that includes businessmen, pilots, and ship captains, usually already have special, high-quality health care plans designed to meet the unique needs to expatriates.<ref name="bipartisanOcareTweak"/> Carney said that "expatriate health insurance plans offer high-end, robust coverage to executives and others working outside their home country, giving them access to a global network of health care providers."<ref name="bipartisanOcareTweak"/> Carney indicated that requiring American expatriate health care providers to meet the tax and reporting requirements of the Affordable Care Act would put them at an unfair competitive disadvantage in comparison to foreign companies offering similar health care plans.<ref name="bipartisanOcareTweak"/>
