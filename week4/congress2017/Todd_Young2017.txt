In 2010, Young stated that he was uncertain what was causing the observed heating of the planet, that it could be caused by sunspots or normal cycles of nature, and that "the science is not settled."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Broder|first1=John|title=Climate Change Doubt Is Tea Party Article of Faith|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/21/us/politics/21climate.html?_r=2&mtrref=en.wikipedia.org|accessdate=October 21, 2016|publisher=The New York Times|date=October 20, 2010}}</ref> That same year he signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Young_Todd.pdf|title=Americans for Prosperity Applauds Indiana U.S. House Candidate Todd Young|accessdate=October 13, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601131811/http://www.americansforprosperity.org/files/Young_Todd.pdf|archivedate=June 1, 2012}}</ref>

===Sponsored legislation===
* [[Fairness for American Families Act]] ({{USBill|113|H.R.|2668}}) – Introduced by Young on July 11, 2013, this bill would "amend the [[Internal Revenue Code]], as amended by the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], to delay until 2015 the requirement that individuals maintain minimal essential health care coverage."<ref name=2668sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 2668 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2668|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=16 July 2013}}</ref> The bill was proposed in response to a July 2, 2013 decision by the [[Presidency of Barack Obama|Obama Administration]] to delay the employer mandate found in the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], but do nothing to the individual mandate requirement.<ref name=housereleasestexts>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House releases texts of health insurance mandate delays|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/310711-house-releases-texts-of-health-insurance-mandate-delays|accessdate=July 16, 2013|newspaper=TheHill.com}}</ref>

When he introduced the Fairness for American Families Act, Young argued that "rather than driving healthcare costs down, the individual mandate is imposing a new tax and burdensome costs on middle class families" and therefore "hardworking Americans deserve the same exemptions that President Obama is unilaterally granting to businesses and labor unions."<ref name="housereleasestexts"/>

* [[Save American Workers Act of 2013]] – is a bill to amend the way in which the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (popularly known as [[Obamacare]]) defines [[full-time]] worker by raising the 30-hour threshold to 40 hours a week, in an effort to remove the incentive some companies may have to reduce their employees' hours in order to avoid the employer healthcare mandate.<ref>{{cite news|title=House approves ObamaCare bill despite veto threat|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/01/08/house-approves-obamacare-bill-despite-veto-threat.html|accessdate=August 14, 2016|publisher=''Fox News''}}</ref><ref name=HadvancesBill>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House advances bill to end ObamaCare's 30-hour workweek|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/202452-house-advances-bill-ending-obamacares-30-hour-workweek|accessdate=April 3, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=April 2, 2014}}</ref><ref name=2575sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 2575 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2575|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 3, 2014}}</ref> Young introduced it into the House on June 28, 2013.<ref name="2575sum"/>
