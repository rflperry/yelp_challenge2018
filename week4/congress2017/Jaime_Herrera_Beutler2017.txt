Herrera Beutler ran for {{ushr|WA|3}}, which was an open seat of retiring Democratic incumbent [[Brian Baird]].

Herrera pledged to provide solutions in Southwest Washington to help stimulate their economy.

Shortly before winning office, Herrera Beutler was named one of [[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine's]] 40 under 40, adding, "The Washington Republican survived a Tea Party challenge to win the GOP primary in the Evergreen State's 3rd Congressional District. Now Herrera, a 31-year-old Latina and former congressional staffer, has successfully re-cast herself as the outsider as she takes on a longtime Democratic pol in November." <ref>{{cite news|title=Jaime Herrera|url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2023831_2023829_2025201,00.html|work=40 under 40|publisher=Time Magazine|date=October 14, 2010}}</ref>

On March 10, Herrera Beutler introduced her first bill as a member of Congress. The "Savings Start With Us" Act would reduce the salaries of Members of Congress, the President and the Vice President of the United States by 10%. In a letter to Congress, Herrera said it was unfair that Congress has voted to remove billions from the budget without cutting their own paychecks, and that this bill would “bring us [Congress] in line with the reductions we're asking the rest of the federal government to absorb.”<ref name=PayCut1>{{cite web |url= http://www.votesmart.org/public-statement/591769/herrera-beutler-proposes-10-salary-cut-for-congress-white-house |title=Press Release: Proposes 10% Salary Cut |date=March 1, 2011 |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref><ref name=PayCut2>{{cite web |url= http://www.vote-smart.org/public-statement/595676/herrera-beutler-introduces-her-first-bill-in-congress |title=Press Release: Herrera Beutler introduces her first bill in congress |date=March 10, 2011 |accessdate=November 19, 2011}}</ref>  The bill has been co-sponsored by Rep.

The girl was born without kidneys, becoming the first child in recorded medical history to breathe on her own without both kidneys. In a [[Facebook]] post, Herrera Beutler said, "She is every bit a miracle." They have named the child Abigail.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2013/07/29/us/ap-us-congresswomans-baby.html?hp] {{Dead link|date=November 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Camia|first=Catalina|title=GOP rep joyous about 'miracle' baby's birth|url=http://www.usatoday.com/story/onpolitics/2013/07/29/jaime-herrera-beutler-daughter-congress-potters-sequence/2596293/|newspaper=USA Today|date=July 29, 2013}}</ref> On July 24, 2013, Herrera Beutler was absent for a roll call vote concerning the [[National Security Agency|NSA]], where she cited health reasons. When she revealed the birth of her daughter, it was realized that the birth was her reason for missing what was considered an important vote.<ref>{{cite news|last=Connelly|first=Joel|title=House narrowly rejects bid to curb NSA surveillance|url=http://blog.seattlepi.com/seattlepolitics/2013/07/24/house-narrowly-rejects-bid-to-curb-nsa-surveillance/|newspaper=Seattlepi|date=July 24, 2013}}</ref>

In a September press release, Herrera Beutler announced that Abigail was getting healthier. "I'm pleased to report that her doctors are happy with her progress and optimistic about her future," Herrera Beutler said in a press release. "Dan and I continue learning how to manage her day-to-day care while she gets healthier and overcomes her health challenges."  <ref name="Zheng"/> She added that she would have to spend a lot of personal time taking care of her daughter, who is expected to be the first person in medical history to survive [[Potter's syndrome]], but is hoping to return to the House Floor for key votes.<ref name="Larson"/><ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/> The multimillion-dollar medical costs for these admittedly "experimental procedures" for Abigail, who will later require a kidney transplant along with lifelong immuno-suppressant drugs, is being covered by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and the mother's congressional medical coverage.<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/ThisWeek/t/video/week-sunday-spotlight-rep-herrera-beutlers-miracle-baby-20193286 Sunday Spotlight: Rep.
