===Electoral College and Presidential Selection===
On December 11 Himes wrote on [[Twitter]] that the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] should not elect president-elect [[Donald Trump]]. "We're 5 wks from Inauguration & the President Elect is completely unhinged. The Electoral College must do what it was designed for." <ref>https://twitter.com/jahimes/status/808116879558660098</ref> On December 12 in an interview on [[CNN]]'s ''[[New Day (TV series)|New Day]],'' he said that he was troubled by several actions by the president-elect. The issue that "pushed me over the edge" was Trump's criticism of the [[CIA]] and the intelligence community. The Congressman did admit that Trump won "fair and square," but he said that Trump proved himself unfit for public office. He cited the intentions behind the creation of the electoral college and he argued that it was created for an instance such as the election of Trump.

“The Electoral College, if you read the [[Federalist Papers]] and understand why it is there, it is a group of people. It is not an [[algorithm]]. It is not a set of ballots. It is a group of people that our Founding Fathers, you know, to whom supposedly we all sort of defer to, pledged the idea that if someone gets elected that is manifestly ill equipped to be president … that the Electoral College can step in.” <ref>Daniel Halper, "New York Post," "Congressman begs Electoral College voters to block Trump," December 12, 2016. http://nypost.com/2016/12/12/congressman-begs-electoral-college-voters-to-block-trump/</ref>
