==Staff Twitter scandal==
On December 8, 2011, three staff members of Larsen were fired by Larsen after they were tweeting insults about Larsen and bragging about drinking on the job in Larsen's Washington D.C. office. Larsen's office fired the offending staffers within hours.<ref>Dinan, Stephen. [http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/inside-politics/2011/dec/8/hill-staffers-tweet-partying-idiot-boss/ Hill staffers tweet of partying, 'idiot boss'], ''[[Washington Times]]'', December 8, 2011.</ref>

==Political positions==
In 2006, ''CQPolitics'' described him:
<blockquote>
Larsen, a member of the centrist [[New Democrat Coalition]] in the House, has carved an image as a [[moderate]] that appeals to crucial swing voters in the politically competitive coastal district in the northwestern corner of [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] State. He still maintains support from  centers surrounding the port cities of [[Everett, Washington|Everett]] and [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]].

Given the importance of defense- and aviation-oriented jobs in the 2nd District, Larsen’s seats on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|Armed Services Committee]] and the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Transportation and Infrastructure Committee]] are politically advantageous.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cqpolitics.com/2006/07/wa_2_despite_a_credible_challe.html |title=Politics Home Page: Roll Call|work=cqpolitics.com|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>
</blockquote>

Rick Larsen has repeatedly cosponsored legislation that would create the [[Wild Sky Wilderness]] area in his home district<ref>{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2003561443_webwildsky08.html |title=Wild Sky wilderness bill back in Congress |work=The Seattle Times |accessdate=18 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524043900/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2003561443_webwildsky08.html |archivedate=May 24, 2011 }}</ref> and is a member of the [[Congressional Wildlife Refuge Caucus]].
Larsen has authored a law that regulates the international marriage brokering industry, by protecting "[[mail order bride]]s" from abuse and clients from being monetarily ripped off.<ref>[http://www.house.gov/larsen/about/bio-extended.shtml House bio]</ref> Among his other priorities are fighting for better access to health care for veterans and the poor, increasing support for government programs that combat homelessness, increasing highway funding, and finding solutions to the growing methamphetamine problem in the district. Larsen also meets regularly with the community-at-large in various events or forums and is able to help provide information if needed.

===Transportation===
One of Rick Larsen’s major priorities is transportation issues. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, he has voted yes on every transportation bill since being reelected in 2008.<ref name="votesmart1">{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/voting_category.php?can_id=56231 |title=Project Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref> He believes that “sound investments in transportation keep our economy moving,” and improve conditions in other areas.<ref name="votesmart1" /> Representative Larsen has gotten over $52 million in the form of transportation projects for the SAFETEA-LU Bill to improve highways, increase funding for ferry systems, and expedite the flow of traffic and goods through border crossings.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.votesmart.org/speech_detail.php?sc_id=400538&keyword=&phrase=&contain= |title=Project Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=18 April 2015}}</ref>
