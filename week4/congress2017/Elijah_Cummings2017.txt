He also made another statement addressing the recent tensions between the people and the police saying that, "We have to look at both sides of this and try to put ourselves in the place of the other,".<ref name="Baltimore City - Baltimore Sun"/> After both speeches he spoke about doing the best to secure safe lives for the children and the future.

==Early life, education and career==

Cummings graduated from [[law school]] at the [[University of Maryland School of Law]], receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1976.  He was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December 1976. He practiced law for 19 years before first being elected to the House in the [[U.S. House election, 1996|1996 elections]].

For 14 years, Cummings served in the [[Maryland House of Delegates]]. In the [[Maryland General Assembly]], he served as Chairman of the [[Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland]] and was the first [[African American]] in Maryland history to be named [[Speaker Pro Tempore]], the second highest position in the House of Delegates.

Congressman Cummings also serves on many different boards and commissions both inside and outside of Baltimore City. Some of those include SEED Schools of Maryland Board of Directors and the University of Maryland Board of Advisors.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Committee assignments===
* '''[[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure]]'''
** [[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation|Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation]]
** [[United States House Transportation Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials|Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials]]

* '''[[United States House Select Committee on Benghazi|Select Committee on Benghazi]]'''  (Ranking Minority Member)

In December 2010 [[Edolphus Towns]] announced that he would not seek the position of [[Ranking Minority Member]] of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress, even though his [[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|seniority]] and service as Chair would typically result in him filling this post. Reportedly, Towns withdrew because of a lack of support from [[Nancy Pelosi]] who feared that he would not be a sufficiently aggressive leader of Democrats in an anticipated struggle with incoming committee chair Republican [[Darrell Issa]].<ref name="tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com">{{cite web|author=Brian Beutler |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/pelosi-power-play-doomed-towns-on-oversight-committee.php |title=Pelosi Power Play Doomed Towns On Oversight Committee &#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref>
Reportedly, the White House also wanted Towns to be replaced.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dc/2010/12/ed-towns-steps-down-sources-bl.html |work=Daily News |title=Ed Towns Steps Down; Sources Blame White House |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216103943/http://www.nydailynews.com:80/blogs/dc/2010/12/ed-towns-steps-down-sources-bl.html |archivedate=December 16, 2010 |df=mdy }}</ref> Cummings defeated [[Carolyn Maloney]] in a vote of the House Democratic Caucus.<ref name="tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com"/>

===Caucus memberships===
* Task Force on Health Care Reform
* Co-founder and Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Drug Policy

Cummings is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]]. He served as Chairman of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] during the [[108th United States Congress]].

Cummings received praise and a boost in notoriety following the Congressional panel hearings on [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] in March 2005. While investigating the use of [[Doping in sport|steroids in sports]], the panel called numerous [[Doping in baseball|baseball]] players to testify, including former single season home run record holder [[Mark McGwire]]. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was "taking the Fifth", referring to the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McGwire responded by saying, "I am here to talk about the future, not about the past."  The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.

===Legislation===
Cummings introduced the [[Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014]], a bipartisan bill signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] in December 2014.  The bill, which Cummings cosponsored with Representative [[Darrell Issa]], Republican of California, is a set of amendments to the [[Federal Records Act]] and [[Presidential Records Act]]. Among other provisions, the bill modernizes the definition of a federal record to expressly include electronic documents.<ref name="NARA2014">[https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2015/nr15-23.html National Archives Welcomes Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014] (press release), [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (December 1, 2014).</ref><ref name="GovExec">Charles S.

Cummings supported the [[Smart Savings Act]], a bill that would make the default investment in the [[Thrift Savings Plan]] (TSP) an age-appropriate [[Target date fund|target date asset allocation investment fund]] (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).<ref name=4193sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4193 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4193|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref> Cummings called the bill a "commonsense change" and argued that the bill "will enable workers to take full advantage of a [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]] fund designed to yield higher returns".<ref name=CommitteePRMar12>{{cite web|title=Oversight Committee Passes Bipartisan Bills to Improve Federal Worker Savings, Whistleblower Protections|url=http://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-passes-bipartisan-bills-improve-federal-worker-savings-whistleblower-protections/|publisher=House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform|accessdate=July 14, 2014|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref>

Cummings introduced the [[All Circuit Review Extension Act]], a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the [[Merit Systems Protection Board]] (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]].<ref name=cbo4197>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4197|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45233|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Cummings said that this program is important to extend because it "allows whistleblowers to file appeals where they live rather than being limited to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals".<ref name=CommitPR1>{{cite web|title=Oversight Committee Passes Bipartisan Bills to Improve Federal Worker Savings, Whistleblower Protections|url=http://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-passes-bipartisan-bills-improve-federal-worker-savings-whistleblower-protections/|publisher=House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform|accessdate=July 15, 2014|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref> He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has "an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases".<ref name="CommitPR1"/>

==Political campaigns==
{{BLP unsourced section|date=December 2012}}
Five-term Congressman [[Kweisi Mfume]] resigned in February 1996 to take the presidency of the [[NAACP]]. Cummings won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district—with 37.5% of the vote. In the special election, he defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kenneth Konder with over 80 percent of the vote.  He defeated Konder again in November by a similar margin to win the seat in his own right.

Cummings has been reelected nine times since then with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 65% of the vote and even running unopposed in 2006. He won a tenth full term in 2014 with 69.9% of the vote.
