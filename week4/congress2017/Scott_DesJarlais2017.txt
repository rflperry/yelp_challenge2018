====2012====
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Tennessee, 2012#District 4}}
Prior to the 2012 election, the Fourth District was significantly altered as a result of redistricting.  Notably, [[Murfreesboro, Tennessee|Murfreesboro]], formerly the heart of the 6th District, was shifted into the 4th. The redrawn 4th contains about half of the constituents who resided in the former 4th district, with 14 of 24 counties being moved elsewhere by redistricting.<ref>{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Michael |url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2012/jan/15/desjarlais-has-to-scramble-with-new-district/ |title=DesJarlais has to scramble with new district alignment » Knoxville News Sentinel |publisher=Knoxnews.com |date=October 26, 2012 |accessdate=October 30, 2012}}</ref>

DesJarlais was challenged by Democratic nominee and [[Tennessee Senate|state senator]] [[Eric Stewart (Tennessee politician)|Eric Stewart]]. For a time, it was thought that DesJarlais would face a primary challenge from state senator [[Bill Ketron]], a Murfreesboro resident and the chairman of the state senate redistricting committee.  However, Ketron decided that he wouldn't run. DesJarlais defeated Stewart 56%–44%<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705219 |title=Ourcampaigns.com |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name="cnnelex">{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/TN# |title=Tennessee election results |date=November 2012 |work=CNN |accessdate=November 15, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112210952/http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/TN |archivedate=November 12, 2012 }}</ref> joining all the other incumbent members of Tennessee congressional delegation who also won their re-election bids.<ref name="CBS election">{{cite news|url=http://www.newschannel5.com/story/20024413/desjarlais-wins-second-term-despite-scandal|title=DesJarlais Wins Second Term Despite Scandal|date=November 7, 2012|work=NewsChannel5.com | location=Nashville|publisher=CBS|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}{{dead link|date=April 2015}}</ref>

Two weeks after DesJarlais won the 2012 election, the ''[[Chattanooga Times Free Press]]'' obtained a full transcript of DesJarlais's 2001 divorce proceedings.<ref>The state Democratic Party had fought DesJarlais's lawyers to get the documents—which ultimately ran to 679 typed pages, as transcribed from court reporters' [[shorthand]]—released, but the court ruled that it could not be entered into the public record until it was properly transcribed in its entirety.
