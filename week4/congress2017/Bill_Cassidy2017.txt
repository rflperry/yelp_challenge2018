==Early life, education and career==
William Morgan Cassidy was born in [[Highland Park, Illinois]], one of four sons born to Elizabeth and James F. Cassidy, and is of Irish and Welsh descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/cassidy.htm|title=bill cassidy|publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref> He received a [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.

In 1998, Cassidy helped found the Greater Baton Rouge Community Clinic to provide uninsured residents of the greater [[Baton Rouge]] area with access to free health care. The Clinic provides low-income families with free dental, medical, [[mental health]] and vision care through a "virtual" approach that partners needy patients with doctors who provide care free of charge.<ref>Anderson, Laurie Smith. "Program offers health care for adults without insurance." ''[[The Advocate (Baton Rouge)|Baton Rouge Morning Advocate]]'', May 24, 2002, Metro Edition, p. 1C.</ref>

In the wake of [[Hurricane Katrina]], Cassidy led a group of health care volunteers to convert an abandoned [[K-Mart]] building into an emergency health care facility, providing basic health care to victims of the hurricane.<ref>{{cite news|last=Ruggeri|first=Amanda|date=November 4, 2008|url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2008/11/04/democratic-trends-dont-help-incumbent-in-unusual-three-way-house-race-in-Louisiana|title=Democratic Trends Don't Help Incumbent in Unusual Three-Way House Race in Louisiana|work=US News & World Report|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref>

==Early political career==
Cassidy was first elected to the Louisiana State Senate in 2006 as a Republican. He had previously been a Democrat: Cassidy supported [[Michael Dukakis]] for president [[United States presidential election, 1988|in 1988]] and donated to the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992 presidential campaign]] of Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] (D-MA),<ref name="triestounite">{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/bill-cassidy-unite-louisiana-conservatives-99284.html|title=Bill Cassidy tries to unite Louisiana conservatives|author=Ginger Gibson|date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="donatedtohis">{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/7105510-125/cassidy-once-donated-to-his|title=Cassidy once donated to his rival|author=Ginger Gibson|accessdate=2014-05-31}}</ref> and to Louisiana Democrats [[Kathleen Blanco]] in the [[Louisiana gubernatorial election, 2003|2003 gubernatorial election]] and [[Mary Landrieu]] in her [[United States Senate election in Louisiana, 2002|2002 Senate campaign]]. In 2013, Cassidy called his donation to Landrieu a "youthful indiscretion," saying that she "got elected and fell into partisan politics... Louisiana hasn't left Mary, Mary has left us." Since 2001, he has mostly contributed to Republican candidates, including Senator [[David Vitter]]. According to Cassidy, he switched parties after the extinction of conservative Democrats and because of his frustration with the bureaucracy and inefficiency of the public hospital system.<ref name="donatedtohis"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/323501-cassidy-donated-to-landrieus-first-reelection|title=Cassidy donated to Landrieu's first reelection|author=Cameron Joseph|date=2013-09-19|accessdate=2014-05-31}}</ref>

On December 9, 2006, Cassidy won a [[special election]] for the District 16 seat in the Louisiana Senate. In his first bid for public office, Cassidy defeated veteran [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] William Daniel, a fellow Republican, and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate S.B. Zaitoon. The election was held to replace [[Jay Dardenne]], who vacated the seat he had held since 1992 upon his election as Louisiana Secretary of State. Cassidy was sworn in on December 20, 2006. On October 20, 2007, Cassidy was reelected, this time to a full four-year term in the Louisiana State Senate. Cassidy received 76% of the vote against Republican Troy "Rocco" Moreau (15%) and Libertarian Richard Fontanesi (9%). {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
On November 4, 2008, Cassidy was elected to serve [[Louisiana's 6th congressional district|Louisiana's 6th district]] in the [[U.S. House of Representatives]], defeating incumbent Democratic Congressman [[Don Cazayoux]] with 48% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Louisiana|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2008/results/states/louisiana.html|website=2008 Election Results|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref> He likely owed his victory to the independent candidacy of state representative Michael L. Jackson. Jackson, who is African-American, finished third with 36,100 votes, more than the 25,000-vote margin separating Cassidy and Cazayoux.

In the 2010 midterm elections, Cassidy easily won a second term, defeating Democrat Merritt E. McDonald of Baton Rouge with 66% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|title=Louisiana 6th District Profile|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2010/house/louisiana/6|website=Election 2010|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}</ref>

In the 2012 election, Cassidy was reelected again, defeating Rufus Holt Craig, Jr., a Libertarian, and Richard Torregano, an Independent. Cassidy received 79% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Chatelain|first1=Kim|title=U.S. Rep.

===Tenure===
In May 2009, Cassidy partnered with Democratic Congresswoman [[Jackie Speier]] (CA) to introduce legislation that would amend the Rules of the House of Representatives to require that Members of Congress list their earmark requests on their Congressional websites. Previous earmark reform efforts had focused on disclosure of earmarks that were funded by Congress.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-bill-cassidy/earmarks-should-require-a_b_236146.html|title=Earmarks should require an itemized receipt|date=2009-07-16|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=Huffington Post}}</ref> In June 2010, he introduced the Gulf Coast Jobs Preservation Act to terminate the moratorium on deep water drilling and require the Secretary of the Interior to ensure the safety of deep water drilling operations.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/111/hr5519|title=H.R. 5519 (111th)|work=GovTrack.us|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://washingtonindependent.com/95208/in-louisiana-candidates-fight-for-and-over-oil-jobs|title=In Louisiana, Candidates Fight For – And Over – Oil Jobs|date=2010-08-19|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=The Washington Independent|first=Andrew|last=Restuccia}}</ref> He worked to ensure that money from the Gulf Coast Restoration Trust Fund, which was established in the wake of the BP oil spill, is spent on coastal restoration efforts.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/6843854-125/congressmen-spar-over-bp-money|title=Congressmen spar over BP money|date=2013-08-23|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=The Advocate|first=Jordan|last=Blum}}</ref>

In December 2010, Cassidy voted to extend the tax cuts enacted during the administration of President [[George W. Bush]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/111/house/2/votes/647|title=To extend Bush tax cuts|work=The U.S. Congress Votes Database|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}</ref> He voted for the Constitutional Balanced Budget Amendment of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/112/house/1/votes/858|title=Balanced Budget Amendment|work=The U.S. Congress Votes Database|accessdate=September 16, 2013}}</ref>

In May 2013, Cassidy introduced the [[Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013]] ({{USBill|113|hr|1582}}) to require the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to submit reports to both the [[United States Congress]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]] regarding proposed regulation that would have significant compliance costs (an impact of over $1 billion).<ref name=cbo1582>{{cite web|title=CBO – 1582|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44443|publisher=United States Congres|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Energybillsadvance>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Energy bills advance with House vote|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/313223-energy-bills-advance-with-house-vote|accessdate=July 26, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> The Department of Energy and Congress would then have the option of stopping or altering the EPA proposal.<ref name="cbo1582"/>

In 2013, due to the [[American Medical Association]]'s decision to officially recognize [[obesity]] as a disease, Senators and Representatives, including Cassidy, helped introduce legislation to lower health care costs and prevent [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]] by addressing America's growing obesity crisis. Cassidy said the [[Treat and Reduce Obesity Act]] can be a part of the new technologies that were developed to help Americans fight obesity. This legislation would help empower physicians to use all the methods and means to fight the condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benzinga.com/news/13/06/3690006/senators-carper-murkowski-representatives-cassidy-kind-introduce-bill-to-help-red#ixzz2X4K9KwPV|title=Senators Carper, Murkowski, Representatives Cassidy, Kind Introduce Bill to Help Reduce Obesity|last1=Gross|first1=Charles|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=Benzinga|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

In June 2013, Cassidy supported a House-passed bill that federally banned [[abortion]]s after 20 weeks of pregnancy.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/06/louisiana-abortion-mary-landrieu-bill-cassidy-107779.html|title=Abortion becomes issue in Louisiana Senate race|work=POLITICO|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref> Also in 2013, Cassidy circulated a draft letter opposing an immigration reform bill, asking for signatures. Representative [[Mark Takano]], a high school literature teacher for 23 years,  marked it up in red pen like a school assignment and gave it an F, with comments like, "exaggeration -- avoid hyperbole," and "contradicts earlier statement."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/12/mark-takano-letter-teacher-republicans_n_3582230.html Rep. Mark Takano Corrects Republican Letter, Proves He Will Always Be A Teacher], By Rebecca Klein, Huffington Post, 07/12/2013</ref>

Cassidy co-sponsored an amendment to the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act in 2014 to limit annual premium increases for flood insurance, re-instate the flood insurance program's grandfathering provision, and eliminate a provision which required an increase to actuarial levels when a home is sold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/will_flood_insurance_bill_get.html|title=Will flood insurance bill get a vote this week?|date=2014-03-12|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|first=Bruce|last=Alpert}}</ref>

Cassidy was a vocal opponent of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly called ObamaCare or the Affordable Care Act).  Citing his background as a physician in a state-run public hospital, Cassidy argued that the health overhaul advocated by President [[Barack Obama]] would fail to lower costs and give too much decision-making authority to the federal government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/5997068-125/cassidy-blasts-obamacare|title=Cassidy blasts Obamacare|date=2013-05-17|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=The Advocate|first=Jordan|last=Blum}}</ref>  On September 11, 2014, the House passed legislation sponsored by Cassidy, the [[Employee Health Care Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 3522; 113th Congress)]], which would enable Americans to keep health insurance policies which do not meet all the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/217440-house-passes-bill-allowing-people-to-keep-health-plans | title=House ok's Cassidy's 'keep your plan' bill|date=2014-09-11|publisher=The Hill|first=Cristina|last=Marcos}}</ref>

Cassidy supported the [[Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].<ref name=cbo4899>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 4899|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr4899.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.<ref name=HousePassesMarcos>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to increase offshore energy projects|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/210690-house-passes-bill-to-increase-offshore-energy-projects|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=26 June 2014}}</ref><ref name=GraeberUPI>{{cite news|last1=Graeber|first1=Daniel J.|title=House measure on gas aimed at lower prices|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/06/27/House-measure-on-gas-aimed-at-lower-prices/9031403872288|accessdate=January 5, 2015|publisher=UPI|date=June 27, 2014}}</ref> He argued that the bill "would allow us to take advantage of our natural resources and expands our energy manufacturing and construction industries."<ref name=TimesPicayune1>{{cite news|last1=Alpert|first1=Bruce|title=House passes bill to expand production and drop cap on sharing|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/06/house_passes_bill_to_expand_oi.html|accessdate=June 27, 2014|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=June 26, 2014}}</ref>
