'''Richard L. Hanna''' (born January 25, 1951)<ref>Christina Paris [http://news.yahoo.com/s/cq/20101103/pl_cq_politics/politics000003758247_1 112th Congress: Richard Hanna, D-N.Y. (24th District)] ''[[CQ Politics]]'' November 3, 2010</ref> is an [[United States|American]] politician who has served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] since 2011. His district was numbered the [[New York's 24th congressional district|24th]] during his first two years in Congress; since 2013, it has been the {{ushr|NY|22|22nd district}}.

== Early life, education, and business career ==
Hanna was born in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and raised in [[Marcy, New York|Marcy]]. His grandparents owned a [[dairy farm]] in [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]]. He graduated from Whitesboro High School in Marcy. Then, he graduated from [[Reed College]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Economics]] and [[Political Science]]. After college, Hanna returned to New York to start his own construction business called Hanna Construction.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/AP130006b0837c4a4a8165804738532220.html Clinton stumps for NY House Dems in tight races] ''[[Associated Press]]'' November 1, 2010</ref> Hanna is of [[Lebanese American|Lebanese descent]].<ref>[https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E1678-4 "Honoring Lebanon on it's 70th Independence Day" Hon.

In 2008, Hanna ran against incumbent Democrat [[Mike Arcuri]] and narrowly lost. In 2010, he ran in a rematch and won.

Due to redistricting, Hanna ran in the new [[New York's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]] in 2012.

In his 2012 campaign for re-election against Democrat [[Dan Lamb]], television stations [[WUTR]] in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[WSYR-TV|WSYR]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] announced they would jointly air a debate between Hanna and Lamb. Hanna declined to participate, citing another scheduled televised debate and five that would not be televised. The stations said that if Hanna did not appear, they would air a 30-minute question-and-answer session with Lamb. According to Steve Merren, the vice president and general manager of WUTR's parent company, [[Nexstar Broadcasting Group]], Hanna then contacted Merren. In an email to staff, Merren stated, "He indicated to me that we would not be considered for his ad dollars and our level of cooperation in the future could be affected." Merren then directed that WUTR not go ahead with the broadcast. Both Merren and a Hanna spokeswoman denied that threats had been made. After the inadvertent disclosure of the internal email, Merren told the press that Hanna “did not say he would pull his ad dollars." The Hanna campaign said that his conversation with Merren had been "nothing more than a courtesy call". The Lamb campaign said that Hanna was "using his money to influence the journalistic decisions of a local news agency."<ref>{{cite web | title = GOP Congressman Threatens Local News Station for Covering Debate| publisher = [[Common Dreams]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/318-66/13825-gop-congressman-threatens-local-news-station-for-covering-debate| accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title = Email: Hanna discussed pulling ads after debate flap with WUTR| publisher = [[Observer-Dispatch]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1931761214/Email-Hanna-discussed-pulling-ads-after-debate-flap-with-WUTR | accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref>

=== Tenure ===
Hanna is a member of the conservative [[Republican Study Committee]] and the centrist [[Republican Main Street Partnership]]. He is a member of the [[LGBT Equality Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://auburnpub.com/news/opinion/blogs/eye_on_albany/article_a3db9800-be1a-11e0-bbc8-001cc4c03286.html |title=Hanna joins House LGBT Equality Caucus |author= Robert Harding|date=August 3, 2011 |work=Auburn Citizen |publisher= |accessdate=August 3, 2011}}</ref> U.S. Congressman Hanna has stated his opposition to the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]].

According to the [[Washington Post]]’s congressional votes database, Hanna has voted with the House Republicans 85% of the time in his first year in office. Only 11 Republicans (out of 244) have a lower percentage.<ref>[http://auburnpub.com/blogs/eye_on_ny/eye-on-ny-a-close-look-at-hanna-s-first/article_086c2bd4-3415-11e1-8b4d-001871e3ce6c.html#ixzz1j1b6W3xX Eye on NY: A close look at Hanna’s first year<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Hanna published an Op-ed opposing the extension of the [[USA Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]] in February 2011. Editors from the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'', which published the piece, later [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2011/03/hannas_near-plagiarism.html reprimanded] Hanna for plagiarizing content from a report by Julian Sanchez of the [[Cato Institute]] in his editorial.  Sanchez indicated that Hanna had his permission to use the content, although he was not referenced in the piece.

The first bill Hanna co-sponsored was H.R. 4 which repealed the 1099 tax reporting provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. President Obama signed the bill into law in April 2011.<ref>[http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=112_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ009.112 www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ9/html/PLAW-112publ9.htm]</ref> In early 2011 Congressman Hanna voted to repeal health care reform.<ref>[http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/rep_bios.php?rep_id=74478446&category=views&id=20101002092318 Richard Hanna – Health Care<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Hanna voted to support the Energy Tax Prevention Act which would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gases and implementing a "cap-and-trade" system through regulation.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll249.xml</ref> Hanna voted against cuts to [[NPR]] and [[Planned Parenthood]].<ref>[http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/deep_federal_spending_cuts_bue.html Deep federal spending cuts?

At a rally in support of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in March 2012, Hanna urged women to donate to Democratic candidates, saying: "I think these are very precarious times for women, it seems. So many of your rights are under assault... Contribute your money to people who speak out on your behalf, because the other side -- my side -- has a lot of it."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/22/richard-hanna-gop-congress_n_1373381.html | work=The Huffington Post | title=Richard Hanna, GOP Congressman, Tells Women To Give Their Money To Democrats | date=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

In the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], he endorsed former [[Utah Governor]] [[Jon Huntsman Jr.]]<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/07/huntsman-to-gain-first-congressional-backer/ | work=CNN | title=Huntsman to gain first congressional backer | date=January 7, 2012}}</ref>

Hanna supported reauthorization of the [[Violence Against Women Act]].<ref>{{cite news | author=Jennifer Bendery | url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/11/violence-against-women-act-john-boehner-eric-cantor_n_2278549.html | title=Violence Against Women Act: John Boehner, Eric Cantor Pressured By Republicans To Act | date=December 11, 2012 | publisher=Huffington Post}}</ref>

In 2013, he supported [[same-sex marriage]], becoming only the second current Republican member of congress to do so (the other being [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]]).<ref>[http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/02/26/gay_marriage_legal_brief_two_republicans_in_congress_support_lgbt_rights.html Gay marriage legal brief: Two Republicans in Congress support LGBT rights<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Rep. Hanna was also a co-sponsor of the Employment Non-Discrimination Act, which would prohibit employment discrimination on the basis of actual or perceived sexual orientation or [[gender identity]] by covered entities (employers, employment agencies, labor organizations, or joint labor-management committees, but exempts religious organizations) nationwide.  New York already has already passed similar legislation into law within the State of New York, but the practice remains legal in 29 U.S. states.  But Rep Hanna is one of several Republican co-sponsors of the bill who refused to sign a Discharge Petition on the bill – a parliamentary maneuver that allows a majority of members of Congress to bring any bill to the floor, even if the leadership opposes doing so.

In June 2013, Hanna voted against proposed legislation to ban [[abortions]] after 20 weeks of pregnancy except for victims of [[rape]] or [[incest]] who have reported the crime to authorities. He opposes partial birth abortions, but stated that he was unable to support this legislation because it would cast aside exception for the health of the mother, and it fails to adequately account for unique circumstances that can arise after 20 weeks because every pregnancy is specific.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2013/06/18/hanna-sole-new-york-republican-to-oppose-house-abortion-bill/ |title=Hanna sole New York Republican to oppose House abortion bill |last1=Tumulty |first1=Brian |date=June 18, 2013 |publisher=Politics on the Hudson |accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

On August 2, 2016, Hanna became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to say that he will vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] for president over [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], referring to the Republican nominee as "a national embarrassment".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep.
