Cotton stated, "I'm committed to bringing affordable higher education to every Arkansan and ending the federal-government monopoly on the student-lending business."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/01/tom-cotton-student-loans_n_3692026.html|title=Tom Cotton, Arkansas Rep., Took Student Loans, Voted Against Them|work=The Huffington Post|accessdate=August 2, 2013|first=Michael|last=McAuliff|date=August 1, 2013}}</ref>

In September 2014, Cotton said he would vote for the Arkansas Minimum Wage Initiative, a November 2014 statewide ballot initiative that calls for raising Arkansas' minimum wage from $6.25 an hour to $8.50 an hour by 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bobic|first1=Igor|title=Tom Cotton Says He Will Vote For Minimum Wage Hike 'As A Citizen'|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/09/05/tom-cotton-minimum-wage_n_5772246.html|accessdate=September 12, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=September 5, 2014}}</ref>

====Foreign issues====
In 2013 Cotton introduced legislative language to prohibit trade with relatives of individuals subject to [[U.S. sanctions against Iran]]. According to Cotton, this would include "a spouse and any relative to the third degree," such as, "parents, children, aunts, uncles, nephews, nieces, grandparents, great grandparents, grandkids, great grandkids." When Cotton's amendment came under harsh criticism regarding the constitutionality of the amendment, he withdrew it.<ref name=WP031115>{{cite news|last1=Waldman|first1=Paul|title=For Tom Cotton, letter to Iran is anything but a ‘fiasco’|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/plum-line/wp/2015/03/11/for-tom-cotton-letter-to-iran-is-anything-but-a-fiasco/|accessdate=March 17, 2015|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=March 11, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Carter|first1=Zach|title=Here's Why Republicans Love Tom Cotton's Letter To Iran|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/17/americans-dont-like-tom-c_n_6887896.html?|accessdate=March 18, 2015|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|date=March 17, 2015}}</ref>

He was the first Republican challenger to unseat an incumbent Democrat in the Senate from Arkansas since Senators were first popularly elected in 1914.  Cotton was sworn into office on January 6, 2015.

====Letter to Iran's leaders====
On or about March 9, 2015, Cotton wrote and sent [[s:An Open Letter to the Leaders of the Islamic Republic of Iran|a letter to the leadership of the Islamic Republic of Iran]], signed by 47 of the Senate's 54 Republicans, attempting to cast doubt on the Obama administration's authority to engage in [[Comprehensive agreement on Iranian nuclear program|nuclear-proliferation negotiations with Iran]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Baker|first1=Peter|title=Angry White House and G.O.P.

President [[Barack Obama]] mocked the letter, referring to it as an "unusual coalition" with [[Army of the Guardians of the Islamic Revolution|Iran's hard-liners]] as well as an interference with the then-ongoing negotiations of a comprehensive agreement on the Iranian nuclear program.<ref>[http://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-31796235 Obama mocks Republican letter to Iran over nuclear talks] from ''[[BBC News]]'', March 9, 2015. Retrieved March 19, 2015</ref> In addition, during a [[Vice News]] interview, President Barack Obama said, "I'm embarrassed for them. For them to address a letter to the Ayatollah – the Supreme Leader of Iran, who they claim is our mortal enemy – and their basic argument to them is: don't deal with our President, 'cause you can't trust him to follow through on an agreement... That's close to unprecedented."<ref>[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/13/obama-iran-letter_n_6864134.html Obama: 'I'm Embarrassed' For Republicans Who Sent Letter To Iran] from ''[[The Huffington Post]]'', March 13, 2015. Retrieved March 19, 2015</ref>

Iran's Foreign Minister, [[Javad Zarif]], responded to the letter by saying "[the Senators'] letter in fact undermines the credibility of thousands of such mere executive agreements that have been or will be entered into by the US with various other governments". Zarif pointed out that the nuclear deal is not supposed to be an Iran–US deal, but an international one, saying that "change of administration does not in any way relieve the next administration from international obligations undertaken by its predecessor in a possible agreement about Iran's peaceful nuclear program". He continued, "I wish to enlighten the authors that if the next administration revokes any agreement with the stroke of a pen, as they boast, it will have simply committed a blatant violation of international law".<ref>[http://en.mfa.ir/index.aspx?siteid=3&fkeyid=&siteid=3&fkeyid=&siteid=3&pageid=1997&newsview=330948 Dr. Zarif`s Response to the Letter of US Senators] from [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Iran)]], March 9, 2015. Retrieved March 19, 2015</ref>

Cotton on March 15, 2015 defended the letter he and fellow Senate Republicans sent to Iranian leaders about their nuclear negotiations with the United States, amid criticism that it undermined the president's efforts. "It's so important we communicated this message straight to Iran," he told CBS News' ''[[Face the Nation]]'' "No regrets at all," and "they already control Tehran, increasingly they control Damascus and Beirut and Baghdad and now Sana'a as well."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/03/15/freshmen-gop-sen-cotton-says-no-regrets-about-letter-warning-iran-about-nuclear/?intcmp=latestnews|title = Freshman GOP Senator Cotton says no regrets about letter warning Iran about Nuclear Deterrent|date = March 15, 2015|accessdate = March 19, 2015|publisher = Fox News Channel}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.cbsnews.com/videos/march-15-kerry-cotton-manchin/|title = Face the Nation|date = March 15, 2015|accessdate = March 19, 2015|publisher = CBS}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/tom-cotton-us-senator-apparently-does-not-know-the-capital-of-iran-10111640.html|title = Tom Cotton, US Senator, apparently does not know the capital of Iran|date = March 16, 2015|accessdate = March 19, 2015|website = The Independent}}</ref> He continued to defend his action in an interview with [[MSNBC]] by saying, "There are nothing but hardliners in Iran. They've been killing Americans for 35 years. They kill hundreds of troops in Iraq. Now they control five capitals in the Middle East. There're nothing but hardliners in Tehran and if they do all those things without a nuclear weapon, imagine what they'll do with a nuclear weapon."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.msnbc.com/morning-joe/watch/tom-cotton--i-want-complete-nuclear-disarmament-410915907561|title = Tom Cotton: I want complete nuclear disarmament|date = March 15, 2015|accessdate = March 19, 2015|publisher = MSNBC}}</ref>

====Military action against Iran====
Cotton accused Obama of holding up a "false choice" between his framework deal on Iran's nuclear program and war. Cotton also seemed to underestimate what military action against Iran would entail,<ref name="npr">{{cite web|url=http://www.npr.org/blogs/itsallpolitics/2015/04/08/398345234/tom-cotton-military-action-against-iran-would-only-take-several-days|title=Tom Cotton: Military Action Against Iran Would Take Only 'Several Days'|last=Montanaro|first=Domenico|date=April 8, 2015|publisher=NPR|access-date=December 28, 2016}}</ref> stating: "the president is trying to make you think it would be 150,000 heavy mechanized troops on the ground in the Middle East again as we saw in Iraq. That's simply not the case." Drawing a comparison to President Bill Clinton's actions in 1998 during [[Bombing of Iraq (1998)|Operation Desert Fox]], he elaborated: "Several days' air and naval bombing against Iraq's weapons of mass destruction facilities for exactly the same kind of behavior. For interfering with weapons inspectors and for disobeying Security Council resolutions."<ref name="npr"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/04/tom-cotton-iran-targeted-attack-116768.html|title=Sen.

====Iran side deals====
On July 21, 2015 Cotton and [[Mike Pompeo]] announced the existence of side agreements between Iran and the IAEA on procedures for inspection and verification of Iran's nuclear activities under the Iran nuclear deal. These side deals have since become a flashpoint in the debate over the Iran deal, in part because their contents have not been publicly disclosed. Cotton described the side deals as "secret", though the Obama Administration disputed this, noting that the IAEA always has a duty of confidentiality.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/07/22/secret-deals-become-latest-congressional-complaint-about-iran-deal/|title=‘Secret deals’ become latest congressional complaint about Iran deal|author=Demirjian, Karoun}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/policy/international/249171-white-house-launches-counterattack-against-iran-side-deal-attacks|title=White House launches Iran side deals counterattack|author=Jordan Fabian and Kristina Wong}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/john-kerry-iran-deal-iaea_55b14997e4b08f57d5d41c12|title=John Kerry's Confident The IAEA Can Handle Iran, But Congress Isn't Buying It|author=Schulberg, Jessica}}</ref>

====Heavy water amendment====
In May 2016 the Senate voted down Cotton’s amendment to an energy spending bill that would have prohibited the U.S. from buying [[heavy water]] from Iran.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://dailysignal.com/2016/06/08/nearly-1-year-since-nuclear-deal-tom-cotton-alarmed-by-empowerment-of-iran/|title=Tom Cotton Warns of Iran Nuclear Deal ‘Consequences’|first=|last=2016|date=June 8, 2016|work=dailysignal.com|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>

====Cassandra Butts nomination====
[[File:Senator of Arkansas Tom Cotton at NH FITN 2016 by Michael Vadon 08.jpg|thumb|Senator Cotton at First In The Nation Townhall, [[New Hampshire]]]]
In February 2015 Obama renominated [[Cassandra Butts]], a former White House lawyer, to be [[United States Ambassador to the Bahamas]].
However, Butts' nomination was blocked by several Republican senators.  First, Sen. [[Ted Cruz]] placed a blanket hold on all U.S. State Department nominees.<ref name="crushed">{{cite web|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/07/opinion/an-obama-nominees-crushed-hopes.html|title=An Obama Nominee’s Crushed Hopes|date=June 7, 2016|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>  Then, Cotton specifically blocked the nominations of Butts and ambassador nominees to Sweden and Norway after the Secret Service had leaked private information about a fellow member of Congress, even though that issue was unrelated to those nominees.<ref name="crushed"/>  Cotton eventually released his holds on the nominees to Sweden and Norway, but kept his hold on Butts' nomination.<ref name="crushed"/>  Butts told New York Times columnist [[Frank Bruni]] that she had gone to see Cotton about his objections to her nomination, and Cotton explained to her that because he knew that the president and Butts were friends, it was a way to "inflict special pain on the president," Bruni wrote.<ref name="crushed"/>  Cotton's spokeswoman did not dispute Butts' characterization, but stressed that Cotton had respect for her and her career.<ref name="crushed"/>  Butts died on May 26, 2016, still awaiting a Senate vote.<ref name="crushed"/>

====Support from pro-Israel groups====
Cotton has been receiving heavy support from pro-Israel groups due to his opposition to the Iran nuclear deal and for his hawkish stance towards Iran. A number of pro-Israel American billionaires have contributed millions of dollars to Cotton, and [[William Kristol]]'s The&nbsp;Emergency Committee for Israel spent $960,000 to support Cotton.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/05/us/politics/gops-israel-support-deepens-as-political-contributions-shift.html|title=GOP's Israel support deepens as political contributions shift}}</ref>

==== Immigration policy in Scandinavia and the United States ====
In an opinion piece published in the [[Wall Street Journal]], Cotton compared the [[Immigration to Norway|immigration policy of Norway]] favourably to that [[Immigration to Sweden|of Sweden]]. He maintained that the Norwegian government had in greater extent than that of Sweden listened to the concerns of its citizens in contrast to the dominant Swedish major parties which did not listen to its constituents.<ref name="wsj_26September2016">{{cite news|last1=Cotton|first1=Tom|last2=Pompeo|first2=Mike|title=What We Learned in Scandinavia About Migrants.|url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/what-we-learned-in-scandinavia-about-migrants-1474932369|accessdate=30 September 2016|publisher=[[Wall Street Journal]]|date=26 September 2016}}</ref> He proceeded to compare the differing results in Scandinavia to that of the United States, where immigration-friendly elites have been held in check by immigration-sceptical constituents.<ref name="wsj_26September2016"/>
