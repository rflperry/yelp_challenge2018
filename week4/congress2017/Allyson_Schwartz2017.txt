[[Pittsburgh]]-area U.S. Congressman [[Ron Klink]] won the crowded, six-candidate Democratic primary with a plurality of 41% of the vote. Schwartz ranked second with 27% of the vote, dominating the southeastern part of the state, most notably Philadelphia (60%) and Montgomery (62%) counties. She also won two counties outside of the region: Centre (33%) and Union (38%). However, this was not enough to overcome Klink's dominance in the western part of the state.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=127072|title=Our Campaigns - PA US Senate- D Primary Race - Apr 04, 2000|publisher=}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2004
In 2003, Democratic U.S. Congressman [[Joe Hoeffel]], of [[Pennsylvania's 13th congressional district]], decided not to run for a fourth term, in order to challenge Republican U.S. Senator [[Arlen Specter]]. Schwartz had originally planned to run for [[Auditor General of Pennsylvania|Auditor General]], but changed her plans after Hoeffel's announcement. In early 2004, she moved from Philadelphia to [[Jenkintown, Pennsylvania|Jenkintown]] in Montgomery County, where she still lives today. She won the Democratic primary, narrowly defeating former [[Philadelphia]] deputy mayor and [[National Constitution Center]] director [[Joe Torsella]] 52%-48%. She won 62% of Montgomery while Torsella won 57% of Philadelphia.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=5104|title=Our Campaigns - PA - District 13 - D Primary Race - Apr 27, 2004|publisher=}}</ref> While most former state legislators raise comparatively more money through [[Political action committee|PACs]] than individual donations, she raised $4,597,032<ref>[http://www.opensecrets.org/states/election.asp?State=PA&year=2004 Pennsylvania Congressional Races in 2008<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> from individual donations and comparatively little ($558,376) in PAC donations. The 13th had long been reckoned as a classic Northeastern "Yankee Republican" district, but had become increasingly Democratic in recent years. A Republican presidential candidate hasn't carried it since 1988, and it has been in Democratic hands for all but four years since 1993. In the general election, she defeated Republican [[Melissa Brown (politician)|Melissa Brown]] 56%-41%, winning both counties.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4327|title=Our Campaigns - PA - District 13 Race - Nov 02, 2004|publisher=}}</ref>
