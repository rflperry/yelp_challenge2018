==Early political career==
In 1970, McDermott made his first run for public office and was elected to the [[Washington State Legislature|Washington state legislature]] as a [[Washington State House of Representatives|representative]] from the [[Washington's 43rd legislative district|43rd District]]. He did not seek re-election in 1972 but instead ran unsuccessfully for [[Governor of Washington]]. In 1974, he ran for the [[Washington State Senate|state senate]], and subsequently was re-elected three times, to successive four-year terms.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} During this time, he crafted and sponsored legislation that would eventually be called the Washington State Basic Health Plan, the first such state program in the country, which offers health insurance to the unemployed and the working poor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://medicare.commission.gov/medicare/mcdermott_bio.html |title=Medicare Commission |publisher=Medicare.commission.gov |date=December 28, 1936 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref> In 1980, while still a state senator, McDermott defeated incumbent [[Dixy Lee Ray]] in the Democratic [[primary election|primary]] for governor, but lost the [[Washington gubernatorial election, 1980|general election]] to Republican [[John Spellman]].  He ran again in 1984, losing the primary to [[Booth Gardner]], who then went on to defeat [[John Spellman|Spellman]] in the [[Washington gubernatorial election, 1984|election]].

In 1987, McDermott briefly left politics to become a [[United States Foreign Service|Foreign Service]] medical officer based in [[Zaire]] now known as [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], providing psychiatric services to Foreign Service, [[United States Agency for International Development|USAID]], and [[Peace Corps]] personnel in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1988, the seat for {{ushr|WA|7}} came open when five-term incumbent [[Mike Lowry]] gave it up to make an unsuccessful run for the Senate.  McDermott returned from Africa to run for the seat.  He won handily with 71 percent of the vote. McDermott has been re-elected 11 times with no substantive opposition.  He usually gets wide support in his district, the most Democratic white-majority district in the nation, even in disastrous years for Democrats nationally. In 1994, for instance, he won with 75% of the vote even as the Republicans won control of Congress and took all but two seats in Washington (his and that of [[Norm Dicks]]). He was re-elected in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010]], taking 83 percent of the vote against independent challenger Bob Jeffers-Schroder. No Republican filed to contest the election in 2010.<ref>{{cite web |title=November 02, 2010 General Election |url=http://vote.wa.gov/results/20101102/CongressionalDistrict7.html |publisher=[[Secretary of State of Washington]] |date=November 29, 2010 |accessdate=February 8, 2014}}</ref> In 2012 McDermott was challenged in the Democratic primary by attorney [[Andrew Hughes (attorney)|Andrew Hughes]]. Despite spending more than $200,000 on his campaign (versus McDermott's primary spending of $387,000), Hughes won just 6-percent of the vote to McDermott's 71-percent.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://slog.thestranger.com/slog/archives/2012/08/21/hughes-spends-over-6x-more-per-vote-than-mcdermott | work=The Stranger | first1=Mike | last1=Gore| title=Hughes Spends Over 6x More per Vote Than McDermott | date=August 21, 2012}}</ref> In the general election, McDermott won just under 80% of the vote, against [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Ron Bemis.<ref>{{cite web|last=Reed|first=Sam|title=WA 7th congressional election results|url=http://vote.wa.gov/results/current/CongressionalDistrict7.html|work=2012 Election results|publisher=WA STATE SEC OF STATE}}</ref>

===Tenure===
;AIDS Housing Opportunity Act of 1990
In his first term, the Congressman sponsored the AIDS Housing Opportunity Act, which provides state and local governments with the resources and incentives to devise long-term comprehensive strategies for meeting the housing needs of persons with AIDS and the families of such persons.<ref>{{cite web |title=Jim McDermott |url=http://www.water1st.org/about/contact/advisory_council/jim_mcdermott.html |work=[[Water 1st International]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723195550/http://www.water1st.org/about/contact/advisory_council/jim_mcdermott.html |archive-date=July 23, 2011 |accessdate=October 18, 2015}}</ref>

The program established, known as HOPWA, has grown to be a $335M line in United States budget, at a cost of $5,432 per recipient in 2010.

;2002 Iraq Trip
In the fall of 2002, McDermott and fellow Representatives [[David Bonior]] of [[Michigan]], [[Nick Rahall]] of [[West Virginia]] and [[Mike Thompson (California politician)|Mike Thompson]] of California visited [[Iraq]]; in Baghdad they met with members of parliament and the Iraqi Foreign Minister, and in Basra they met with residents who talked about the effect on them of the [[Iraq sanctions]]. American conservatives sharply criticised McDermott for this trip, and for his predictions that President [[George W. Bush]] would "mislead the American public" to justify military action and that no [[Weapon of mass destruction|WMD]] would be found in Iraq.<ref>{{cite news |title=The story behind McDermott's controversial Iraq trip|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2004311506_mcdermott28m.html|work=Seattle Times|accessdate= June 2, 2011|first=David|last=Postman|date=March 28, 2008}}</ref>

According to a disclosure form filed with the clerk of the House of Representatives, the nonprofit organization ''Life for Relief and Development'' paid McDermott's $5,510 travel expenses for the Iraq trip. On March 26, 2008, a Bush Administration indictment accused Muthanna Al-Hanooti of arranging for the trip and paying for it with funds from [[Saddam Hussein]]'s intelligence agency, the IIS.<ref>{{cite news |title=Indictment: Hussein fed money to spy for U.S. officials' trip|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/POLITICS/03/26/iraq.trip/index.html |accessdate= March 26, 2008 | work=CNN |date=March 26, 2008}}</ref> Ultimately these charges were dropped; Al-Hanooti was convicted of attempting to sell Iraqi oil to raise money for humanitarian purposes without permission of the U.S. Treasury.<ref>{{cite web |title=From spy to a patriot: Muthanna al-Hanooti

;Pledge of Allegiance
On April 28, 2004, Congressman McDermott omitted the phrase "under God" while leading the House in reciting the [[Pledge of Allegiance]].  The incident occurred after [[atheist]] [[Michael Newdow]] lost his court case to have the phrase "under God" dropped from the Pledge, and after McDermott had voted against a congressional resolution that called for overturning a court ruling that declared the phrase unconstitutional.  In 1954, during the [[McCarthy era]] and communism scare, Congress had passed a bill, which was signed into law, to add the words "under God."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/nat_pled1.htm |title=Pledge of Allegiance and its "under God" phrase |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref> McDermott later stated that he had  "reverted to the pledge as it was written and taught in the public schools throughout my childhood", as the phrase "under God" was added in 1954, the year in which McDermott graduated from high school;<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/national/171126_jim29.html | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=Wyatt | last1=Buchanan | title=McDermott's pledge error blamed on a childhood moment | date=April 28, 2004}}</ref> he turned 18 in late December of that year, after graduating.<ref name=Bioguide>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=M000404 |title=McDERMOTT, James A. - Biographical Information |publisher=Bioguide.congress.gov |date= |accessdate=May 5, 2015}}</ref>

;Boehner v. McDermott
In December 2004, the [[United States House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct|House Ethics Committee]] investigated McDermott over the leaking of an illegally recorded telephone conversation during a 1997 committee investigation of then-Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]].

In the conversation, Mr. Gingrich, his lawyer and several other Republican Congressmen discussed how Gingrich's Congressional allies should deal with the political consequences of his admission that he had violated House ethics rules by giving inaccurate information to the House Ethics Committee for its inquiry into his use of tax-exempt funds. Democrats have described the conversation as evidence that Mr. Gingrich broke an agreement with the Ethics Committee that he would not orchestrate a politically motivated response to those committee findings.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9800E0D91F38F935A25752C0A961958260&scp=2&sq=McDermott%20tunrs%20over%20intercepted%20conference%20call&st=cse |work=New York Times | accessdate=January 16, 2010 |title= Inquiry on Gingrich Call to Look at Plausibility of Florida Couple's Account |first=Neil A. |last=Lewis |date=January 16, 1997}}</ref>

The recording was made by John and Alice Martin, who claimed that they had overheard the conversation on a police scanner, decided to record it for posterity's sake, and then decided that it might be important for the Ethics Committee to hear.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/01/13/tape/index.shtml | work=CNN | accessdate=May 6, 2010 | title=Potentially Illegal Gingrich Tape Turned Over To Criminal Investigators}}</ref> The Martins gave the tape to McDermott because he was the senior Democrat on the Ethics Committee.<ref>{{cite news|last=Gray|first=Jerry|title=Florida Couple Are Charged In Taping of Gingrich Call|url=http://www.nytimes.com/1997/04/24/us/florida-couple-are-charged-in-taping-of-gingrich-call.html?ref=alicehmartin|accessdate=June 28, 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=April 24, 1997}}</ref> Within two days, reportedly after the Republican Ethics Committee Chair Nancy L.

[[File:Jim McDermott 08.jpg|thumb|McDermott speaking in 2008]]
Rep. [[John Boehner]], who was part of the Gingrich conversation, sued McDermott in his capacity as a private citizen, seeking punitive damages for violations of his First Amendment rights.<ref>{{cite news|last=Alvarez|first=Lisette|title=Congressman Sues a Colleague Over Disclosing G.O.P.

Hogan|Thomas Hogan]] ordered McDermott to pay Boehner for "willful and knowing misconduct" that "rises to the level of malice", McDermott appealed, arguing that since he had not created the recording, his actions were allowed under the First Amendment, and that ruling against him would have 'a huge chilling effect' on reporters and newsmakers alike. Eighteen news organizations – including ABC, NBC, CBS, CNN, The Associated Press, the ''New York Times'' and the ''[[Washington Post]]'' — filed a brief backing McDermott.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/politics/2002895236_webmcdermott28.html | work=The Seattle Times | title=Appeals Court rules against McDermott in taped call dispute | first=Matthew | last=Daly | date=March 28, 2006}}</ref> On March 29, 2006, the court ruled 2–1 that McDermott violated federal law when he turned over the illegally recorded tape to the media outlets, ordering McDermott to pay Boehner's legal costs (over $600,000) plus $60,000 in damages. On June 26, 2006, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit]] vacated the judgment, deciding to re-hear the case with all nine judges.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/06/26/AR2006062601135.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Matthew | last=Daly | accessdate=May 6, 2010 | title=Court to Hear Arguments in Taped Call Case | date=June 26, 2006}}</ref> However, a split 4 to 1 to 4 [[en banc]] decision in ''Boehner v.

The Ethics Committee formally rebuked McDermott in 2006, writing he had "violated ethics rules by giving reporters access to an illegally taped telephone call involving Republican leaders a decade ago.

The purpose of this act was to encourage job creation, strengthen the economic recovery, and assist those unable to find jobs during the serious economic downturn that began in 2008.<ref>{{USBill |111|HR|3548|pipe=Bill Summary & Status; 111th Congress (2009 - 2010); H.R.3548 |site=yes}}</ref> While the bill had unrelated provisions, the primary focus was on the extension of the $8,000 first-time home buyer tax credit; opinion is divided as to the effectiveness of the program.<ref>{{cite news|last=KOCIENIEWSKI|first=David|title=Mixed Results for Home Buyer Tax Credit|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/27/business/27home.html|work=Home Buyer Tax Credit|accessdate=June 23, 2011|date=April 26, 2010}}</ref>

;Conflict Minerals Trade Act of 2010
This legislation requires publicly traded companies in the United States exercise due diligence to ensure that [[conflict minerals]] (gold, tin, tantalum and tungsten) in their products do not come from mines funding civil war in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]] (DRC). Originally proposed as a standalone bill, it became section 1502 of the 2010 [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act#Disclosures on Conflict Materials in or Near the Democratic Republic of the Congo|Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]]. A [[United Nations Security Council]] committee reported that this legislation was a "catalyst" for efforts to save lives by cutting off a key source of funding for armed groups <ref name=interim>{{cite web

;Tax Parity for Health Plan Beneficiaries Act 2010, 2011
McDermott sponsored a bill which would have eliminated the tax burden incurred by married same sex couples, same-sex and opposite-sex domestic partners. The bill also would have ensured that domestic partners of federal civilian employees receive the same health care benefits as married spouses, including retirement, compensation for work injuries, and full life and health insurance benefits. It was eventually folded into and taken out of the House Health Care Bill in 2010, and has been referred to committee both times, where it died. Versions of this bill were co-sponsored under McDermott's leadership since the 106th Congress with Republican Senator Gordon Smith of Oregon. The 2010 (111th Congress) and 2011 (112th Congress) bills were co-sponsored by Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2011/06/09/mcdermott-introduces-pro-gay-tax-equity-bill/ |title=McDermott introduces pro-gay tax equity bill|last=Johnson |first=Chris |work=[[Washington Blade]] |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}</ref>

;Federal Reserve Transparency Act
In April 2012, McDermott was one of over 270 congressmen and congresswomen who co-sponsored the [[Federal Reserve Transparency Act]], which will "require a full audit of the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]] and the Federal Reserve banks by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]] before the end of 2012" if it is passed.<ref>[http://www.dailypaul.com/155726/update-hr-459-55-co-sponsors Update - Audit The Fed: HR 459 - 271 Co-sponsors]</ref>

;The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act
In June 2011, McDermott introduced The Internet Gambling Regulation and Tax Enforcement Act (H.R. 2230) along with [[John B. T. Campbell III|John Campbell]] (R-Calif.) and [[Barney Frank]] (D-Mass).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/167091-house-internet-gambling-bill-would-require-withholding-taxes-on-winnings |title=House Internet gambling bill would require withholding taxes on winnings|last=Kasperowicz |first=Pete |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |date=June 17, 2011 |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}</ref> This represented McDermott’s fifth introduction of such an act, which would offer a tax structure should [[online gambling]] become fully legalized and regulated within the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.livecasinodirect.com/guide/gambling-laws/usa/online-gambling-law/ |title=McDermott bill to decriminalize online gaming |publisher=Livecasinodirect.com |date=April 6, 2010 |accessdate=April 11, 2013}}</ref>
;Ways and Means Committee Hearing on 2011-2013 IRS Scandal
On June 6, 2013 McDermott addressed victims of the IRS Scandal, showing sympathy and publicly stating that what had occurred was unacceptable, while also pointing out that the conservative groups would not have been targeted at all had they not filed for tax relief. Congressman Paul Ryan subsequently suggested that blaming the victims was inappropriate, and Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly interviewed Congressman McDermott on less than cordial terms, causing McDermott to demand she stop putting words in his mouth.
