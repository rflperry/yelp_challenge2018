'''Rubén Eloy Hinojosa''' (born August 20, 1940) is the retiring [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|TX|15}}, serving since 1997. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The district stretches from [[Seguin, Texas|Seguin]] (east of [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]]), to [[McAllen, Texas|McAllen]] on the [[Mexico|Mexican]] border. Much of the region is [[rural]] although [[Hidalgo County, Texas|Hidalgo County]] is part of the third fastest-growing [[metropolitan statistical area]] in the country. Hinojosa serves on the House [[House Financial Services Committee|Financial Services]] and [[House Education and the Workforce Committee|Education]] committees.

==Early life, education, and career==

Hinojosa was born in [[Edcouch, Texas|Edcouch]], Texas. The eighth of eleven children, Hinojosa was reared in Hidalgo County, which borders on Mexico, and earned two business degrees,<ref name="WP Politics"/> a [[Bachelor of Business Administration]] from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and his [[MBA]] from the [[University of Texas-Pan American]]. For two decades, he was the president and chief financial officer of his family's food processing company, H&H Foods. [[U.S. President]] [[Ronald W. Reagan]] named H&H the “Number One Minority-Owned Business in America” in 1983. In 1987, the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]] named the Hinojosas “Minority Entrepreneur of the Year.”<ref>{{cite news |title= Court OKs debt plan for H&H Foods|author= Sean Gaffney|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/news/court-89938-debt-oks.html|newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= September 11, 2008|accessdate= }}</ref>

By 1994, the company was one of the major employers in the [[Rio Grande]] area, with 350 employees, and had begun to produce ready-to-eat foods. In 2005, it had $40 million in revenue but had 270 employees.<ref name="H&H">{{cite news |title= Mercedes' H&H Foods files for bankruptcy|author= Kyle Arnold|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/mercedes-83207--.html|newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= |accessdate= }}</ref>

In 1974, Hinojosa was elected to the [[Texas State Board of Education]], a position which he held for ten years.

Hinojosa’s father and uncle founded H&H Foods in 1947 as a [[slaughterhouse]]. Control of the firm passed in 1976 to himself and his brother, Liborio.  He gave up his executive position when he entered Congress, but remained a director and major stockholder.<ref>{{cite news |title= Mercedes' H&H Foods files for bankruptcy|author= Kyle Arnold|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/mercedes-83207--.html|newspaper= The Brownsville Herald|date= January 4, 2008|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
After 32-year incumbent [[Kika de la Garza]] announced his retirement, Hinojosa won a five-way primary for the seat by only 588 votes.  This practically assured him of being only the sixth person to represent this heavily Democratic, Latino-majority district.  He defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Tom Haughey with 62 percent of the vote. He defeated Haughey again in 1998, winning 59 percent of the vote. In 2000, he took 89 percent of the vote against the [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] Frank L. Jones, III. In 2002, he was unopposed.  In 2004, Hinojosa faced Republican Michael Thamm in the redrawn District 15 and defeated the former major, winning 59 percent of the vote. In the 2006 mid-term election he faced Paul Haring and Eddie Zamora, both Republicans. Hinojosa won 61 percent of the vote in the once-again redrawn district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1761 |title=Ourcampaigns.com |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>

In the general election held on November 4, 2014, Hinojosa squared off once again with the Republican 
Eddie Zamora, who received 7,776 votes (54.9 percent) in the primary election held on March 4. Douglas A. "Doug" Carlile (born c. 1963) polled the remaining 6,393 Republican ballots (45.1 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176|title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=March 5, 2014}}</ref>

Hinojosa did not seek an eleventh term in the House in [[U.S. House elections, 2016|2016]]. Democrats Vicente Gonzalez and Juan "Sonny" Palacios, Jr., meet in the May 24 [[runoff election]] to select a nominee to succeed Hinojosa. Gonzalez led in the March 1 primary with 22,122 votes (42.2 percent); Palacios trailed with 9,907 votes (18.9 percent). The remaining 28.9 percent of the vote was shared by four other candidates.

Three Republicans contested the seat in the primary election. Tim Westley (born c. 1972), an [[African-American]] [[Conservative (politics)|conservative]] pastor of Shepherd's Vineyard Christian Church in [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]], who carries the backing of the [[Tea Party movement]], led the field with 13,153 votes (45.3 percent). He faces a runoff on May 24 with Ruben O. Villarreal, who received 9,131 votes (31.5 percent); the third-placed candidate, Xavier Salinas, drew a critical 6,730 votes (23.2 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://enrpages.sos.state.tx.us/public/mar01_273_state.htm?x=0&y=2305&id=322|title=Republican returns|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=March 4, 2016}}</ref> Villarreal is the mayor of [[Rio Grande City, Texas|Rio Grande City]], a non-partisan position, in heavily Democratic [[Starr County, Texas|Starr County]].<ref>Aaron Nelsen, "Hinojosa becomes emotional while announcing retirement, ''[[San Antonio Express-News]]''|date=November 14, 2015, pp. A3-A4</ref>

One Green, Vanessa S. Tijerina (born c. 1978), a female Latina Progressive, nurse and biologist. Tijerina is an underdog in this election, hoping for a black horse win.

Three candidates, Democrat Vicente Gonzalez, Republican Tim Westley and Green Vanessa Tijerina will compete in the November 8, 2016, general election for the right to succeed Hinojosa.

==Political positions==

Hinojosa has been called a “hard-core [[Liberalism|liberal]]” and a “rank-and-file Democrat”.<ref>{{cite news |title= Texas House: Ruben Hinojosa|author= |url= http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Ruben_Hinojosa.htm |newspaper= On the Issues|date= |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/ruben_hinojosa/400179|title= Rep. Rubén Hinojosa|author= |date= |work= GovTrack|publisher= |accessdate= }}</ref>  The 'That's My Congress' website has given Hinojosa a “Liberal Action Score” of 37/100 and a “Conservative Action Score” of 16/100 for his votes in the 112th Congress.<ref name="GovTrack">{{cite news |title= Rep. Ruben Honojosa|author= |url= http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/ruben_hinojosa/400179 |newspaper= GovTrack|date= |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref><ref name="Thats Congress">{{cite news |title= Democratic Representative Rubén Hinojosa of Texas|author= |url= http://thatsmycongress.com/house/repHinojosaTX15112.html |newspaper= That's my Congress|date= |accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

During the [[111th Congress]], Hinojosa voted with his party 99 percent of the time. He voted to extend the [[Patriot Act]] and supported the 2011 budget compromise.  He voted for the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] ([[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Obamacare]]), the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]], otherwise known as, “Cap and Trade”,<ref name="Thats Congress"/> and the [[Troubled Asset Relief Program]].<ref name="GovTrack"/>

Hinojosa has emphasized assisting minorities and low-income Americans gain access to higher education. He has been especially active in supporting water-conservation projects along the Mexican border, and in replacing federal subsidies for student loans with direct government loans. Hinojosa and George Miller were responsible for constructing the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act, which increased the maximum Pell Grants available to low-income students and authorized additional funding for minority-serving schools.

He co-sponsored a 2010 bill for enhanced border security, but has opposed the construction of a wall along the border.

He has also been a very strong supporter of free-trade agreements, and was one of 15 House Democrats to vote for the 2005 Central American Free Trade Agreement.<ref name="WP Politics"/>

In 2010, Hinojosa supported the introduction of full-body scanners at Valley International Airport.  He said that we need to take more precautions when it comes to public safety, and that the new technology “gives TSA employees a distinct advantage in the prevention of terrorist events.”<ref>{{cite news |title= Valley International Airport to get full-body scanners|author= Gabriel Saldana|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/font-112944-size-small.html |newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= June 5, 2012|accessdate= }}</ref>

In June 2011, Hinojosa introduced legislation that would expand the authority of NADBank, which had already funded more than 100 projects to prevent the release of untreated sewage into the Rio Grande and other bodies of water, to finance infrastructure projects designed to enhance economic development along the border and raise environmental standards.<ref>{{cite news |title= Wastewater projects improve Rio Grande water quality|author= Jared Janes|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/wastewater-128140-rio-water.html|newspaper= Brownsville Herald|date= June 25, 2011|accessdate= }}</ref>

He has also supported measures to aid undocumented workers. He backed the “AgJobs” bill aimed at helping undocumented farm workers. He has been an advocate of the DREAM Act, which would provide citizenship to people who were brought to the U.S. as children by their parents.<ref name="WP Politics">{{cite news |title= Ruben Hinojosa (D-Tex.)|author= |url= http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/ruben-hinojosa-d-tex/gIQAvN7UAP_topic.html#at-a-glance|newspaper= Washington Post|date= July 24, 2012|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}

Rubén Hinojosa) |publisher=TheHill |date=September 21, 2010 |accessdate=August 10, 2014}}</ref>  He cited his concern that these children came to the US alongside their parents and should not be faulted. Hinojosa argued that “[o]ur country is much better off by being able to let those children get a college education and serve in the military and contribute to the prosperity of our country.”<ref>{{cite news |title= Hinojosa, Hispanic Tea Party support DREAM Act|author= Neil Morton|url= http://www.brownsvilleherald.com/articles/support-129153-bill-local.html|newspaper= The Brownsville Herald|date= July 24, 2011|accessdate=August 8, 2012}}</ref>

[[J. M. Lozano]], Republican member of the [[Texas House of Representatives]] from [[Kingsville, Texas|Kingsville]] in [[Kleberg County, Texas|Kleberg County]], for a time worked on Hinojosa's staff in McAllen beginning in 2003. At the time Lozano was a Democrat.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ballotpedia.org/J.M._Lozano|title=J. M. Lozano|publisher=ballotpedia.org|accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

Three candidates, Democrat Vicente Gonzalez, Republican Tim Westley and Green Vanessa Tijerina will compete in the November 8, 2016, general election for the right to succeed Hinojosa. Gonzalez won his nomination, 66 to 34 percent, in a [[runoff election|runoff]] against Juan "Sonny" Palacios, Jr. Westley narrowly defeated fellow Republican Ruben O. Villarreal with 51.6 percent of the ballots cast.
