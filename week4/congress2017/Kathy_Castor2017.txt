==Political campaigns==

===2006===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2006}}
The House seat in the district became open when five-term Democrat [[Jim Davis (Florida politician)|Jim Davis]] (D) chose to run for governor (he lost to [[Charlie Crist]] in November).

Castor won the September 5, 2006 Democratic primary—the real contest in what has long been the only safe Democratic district on Florida's Gulf Coast—defeating challengers Al Fox, Lesley "Les" Miller, Scott Farrell, and Michael Steinberg. She received 54% of the vote, a full 20 points ahead of state Senate Minority Leader Les Miller in the five-way race.

Eddie Adams Jr., an architect and former hospital laboratory technologist,<ref>{{cite web|title=Homepage|url=http://adamsforcongress.org/|publisher=Eddie Adams, Jr. for U.S. Congress|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> was the only [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to file.  Castor was endorsed by the pro-choice political action committee [[EMILY's List]], the League of Conservation Voters, Oceans Champions, The Tampa Tribune, The St. Petersburg Times and The Bradenton Herald.

Castor handily won the 2006 November general election, 70% to 30%--becoming the first woman to represent Tampa and St. Petersburg in Congress, as well as only the third representative of this St. Petersburg/Tampa-based district since its creation in 1963 (it was the 10th District from 1963–67, the 6th from 1967–73, the 7th from 1973–93 and has been the 11th since 1993).

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 11}}
Castor was reelected in November 2008 71% to 29% in a rematch with Adams.

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 11}}
Castor was challenged by Republican nominee Mike Prendergast, a career military officer who retired in 2008 as a [[Colonel]] in the [[United States Army]]. Castor was reelected in November 2010 with 60% of the vote to Prendergast's 40%. Though Castor won convincingly, it was still the best showing for a Republican in this district since 1994.

{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 14}}
After the 2010 census, Florida gained two more congressional seats. As a result, Castor's district was redistricted from the 11th to the 14th. It was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Castor won reelection with 70.2 percent of the vote over Republican E. J. Otero.
