Scott originally planned to campaign for Governor of Georgia, announcing his campaign in January 2009. He made headlines for walking more than 1,000 miles around the state in his "Walk of Georgia",<ref>[http://walkingwithaustin.com "Walk of Georgia"]</ref> introducing a bill to abolish tolls on [[Georgia State Route 400|Georgia 400]], and leading the charge in pressuring Georgia State Attorney General [[Thurbert Baker]] to file a lawsuit against the Federal government over the controversial [[Health care reform in the United States|health care reform bill]] passed in March 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiftongazette.com/local/x323702349/Scott-plans-1-000-mile-Walk-Around-Georgia|title=Scott plans 1,000-mile 'Walk Around Georgia'|publisher=Tifton Gazette|date=2009-06-24|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://swgapolitics.com/index/2009/08/29/austin-scott-completes-walk-of-georgia|title=Austin Scott Completes Walk of Georgia|publisher=SWGA Politics|date=2009-08-29|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Badertscher|first=Nancy|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/abolish-ga-400-toll-397683.html|title=Abolish Ga. 400 toll, candidate's bill proposes|publisher=ajc.com|date=2010-03-23|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Tharpe|first=Jim|url=http://www.ajc.com/news/georgia-politics-elections/republican-lawmaker-wants-state-407164.html|title=Republican lawmaker wants state to ‘direct' Baker to sue over health care|publisher=ajc.com|date=2010-03-26|accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> In April 2010, Scott withdrew from the race for Governor to instead run for U.S. Congress.

===2012 election===
The Georgia General Assembly redrew the 8th after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]]. Notably, most of [[Macon, Georgia|Macon]] and surrounding [[Bibb County, Georgia|Bibb County]] (except for a sliver in the north) were drawn into the neighboring [[Georgia's 2nd congressional district|2nd District]]. Macon had been the heart of the 8th and its predecessors for more than a century. To make up for the loss of population, the General Assembly pushed the 8th all the way to the [[Florida]] border, adding [[Thomasville, Georgia|Thomasville]] and most of [[Valdosta, Georgia|Valdosta]] from the old 2nd. The old 8th already had a significant Republican lean, with a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of R+10. However, the new 8th has a CPVI of R+15, making it the 11th most Republican district in the [[Eastern Time Zone]] and one of the most Republican districts in the country.

Scott was unopposed in both the primary and general elections.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/GA/42277/112424/en/summary.html|title=GA – Election Results|accessdate=November 17, 2012}}</ref>

===2014 election===
Scott was unopposed for a third term.

===2016 election===
In 2016, Scott faced a Democratic opponent for the first time since his initial run for the seat, from private investigator James Neal Harris. However, Scott turned back this challenge fairly easily, taking 67.6 percent of the vote and carrying every county in the district.<ref>http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=801578</ref>
