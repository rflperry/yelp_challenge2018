On June 16, 2013, Sinema became an original cosponsor of the bipartisan LIBERT-E Act, along with Rep. [[Justin Amash]], which limits the National Security Agency to only collecting electronic information from subjects of an investigation.<ref>{{cite web|title=Thomas.gov|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d113:HR02399:@@@P|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

On July 24, 2013, Sinema joined a bipartisan majority and voted against an amendment to a defense appropriations bill to prohibit the National Security Agency from monitoring and recording details of US citizens' telecommunications without a warrant.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Vote 412 - Rejects Limits on N.S.A. Data Collection|url=https://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/113/house/1/412|work=Inside Congress|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=March 20, 2014}}</ref> She later explained her vote against the amendment by saying, “I, along with my colleagues in the House, was given assurances by the intelligence community that abuses did not occur intentionally or regularly, were quickly resolved, and were fully reported. I voted against the well-intentioned but overly broad Amash amendment to the Defense Appropriations Act in part because of these assurances, and due to my belief that we must strike a thoughtful balance that protects both our constitutional liberties and our security.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Sinema News Release|url=http://sinema.house.gov/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=017BCE92-390F-4A31-9432-0529355A8C6D|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

Sinema voted against repealing the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GovTrack|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h154|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref> Sinema has called for reforms to the law.<ref>{{cite news|title=Republic Opinion|url=http://www.azcentral.com/opinions/articles/20130901affordable-care-act-fixes-address.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Arizona Republic}}</ref> She has said that the health care law isn't perfect, and that in Congress she will work to amend the law to make it work effectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Congressional Debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGGqB4HJIJY|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

Speaking about healthcare policy, Sinema said, "I used to say that I wanted universal health-care coverage in Arizona, which went over like a ton of bricks. Turns out, Arizonans hear the word "universal" and think "socialism"—or "pinko commie." But when I say that I want all Arizonans to have access to affordable, quality health care, Arizonans agree wholeheartedly. Same basic idea, different language."<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyrsten Sinema on Health Care|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Kyrsten_Sinema_Health_Care.htm|publisher=On the Issues|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>

====Foreign policy====
After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, Sinema was involved in organizing a Phoenix-area group called the Arizona Alliance for Peaceful Justice (AAPJ). According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', "The group’s mission statement at the time called military action
'an inappropriate response to terrorism' and advocated for using the legal system — not violence — to bring [[Osama bin Laden]] and others to justice." Sinema wrote: "As one of the core organizers against the war from day one (September 12, 2011), I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms."<ref name=hill>{{cite news|last=Lederman|first=Josh|title=Candidate's stance on Afghan, Iraq wars faces scrutiny in Democratic primary|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/224919-candidates-stance-on-afghan-iraq-wars-faces-scrutiny-in-dem-primary|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=February 5, 2012}}</ref>

Sinema has advocated against the Israeli occupation of the [[Palestinian territories]] and has helped form several groups that oppose the U.S.-Israel alliance. The AAPJ, which Sinema co-founded, has denounced Israel’s “disproportionate” use of “violence and oppression,” decried U.S. military aid to Israel, and protested the expansion of Israeli settlements “into Palestinian lands.” Sinema's activism and views regarding Israel have been criticized by Republicans and Democrats, including Jay Goodlik, a former Special Assistant to [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=hill/><ref name=beacon>{{cite news|last=Kredo|first=Adam|title=Adult Sinema|url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/adult-sinema/|accessdate=February 14, 2015|newspaper=Washington Free Beacon|date=2012-04-20}}</ref><ref name=town>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Guy|title="Moderate" Arizona Democrat Has Deep Ties to Left-Wing Radicals, Obama White House|url=http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2012/05/11/meet_kyrsten_sinema|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=Townhall|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Alana|title=The Reinvention of an Anti-War Activist|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/07/23/the-reinvention-of-an-anti-war-activist-sinema|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=Commentary Magazine|date=2012-07-23}}</ref> Sinema is a former spokesperson for Women in Black, an anti-war group that was founded in part to support Palestinians during the [[First Intifada|Intifada]].<ref name=beacon/><ref>{{cite news|last=Footlik|first=Jay|title=Can Jews believe Kyrsten Sinema?|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/rosnersdomain/item/guest_post_can_jews_believe_kyrsten_sinema_20120805|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=Jewish Journal|date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> She supports reducing defense spending.<ref name=issues/>

Sinema opposed [[Arizona SB 1070]]. Sinema argues that mass deportation of illegal immigrants is not an option and supported the [[DREAM Act]]. Sinema believes that "we need to create a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented workers that requires them to get right with the law by paying back taxes, paying a fine and learning English as a condition of gaining citizenship." <ref>http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Kyrsten_Sinema_Immigration.htm</ref>

==Personal life==
On November 17, 2013, Sinema completed an [[Ironman Triathlon]] in a little more than 15 hours. According to ''[[Politico]]'', Sinema was the second active member of Congress—behind Senator [[Jeff Merkley]]—to finish an Ironman; although several sources, such as Triathlete Magazine, consider Sinema the first, since Merkley completed a non-Ironman-branded race.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kopan|first=Tal|title=Rep.

Sinema voted against repealing the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite web|title=GovTrack|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h154|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref> Sinema has called for reforms to the law.<ref>{{cite news|title=Republic Opinion|url=http://www.azcentral.com/opinions/articles/20130901affordable-care-act-fixes-address.html|accessdate=March 30, 2014|newspaper=Arizona Republic}}</ref> She has said that the health care law isn't perfect, and that in Congress she will work to amend the law to make it work effectively.<ref>{{cite web|title=2012 Congressional Debate|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGGqB4HJIJY|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

Sinema has voted to delay the initiation of fines on those who don’t purchase insurance in 2014. She has also voted to repeal the Medical Device Tax and for the Keep Your Health Plan Act of 2013.<ref>{{cite web|title=GovTrack|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h363|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=New York Times|url=https://politics.nytimes.com/congress/votes/113/house/1/497|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Gov Track|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/113-2013/h587|accessdate=March 30, 2014}}</ref>

Speaking about healthcare policy, Sinema said, "I used to say that I wanted universal health-care coverage in Arizona, which went over like a ton of bricks. Turns out, Arizonans hear the word "universal" and think "socialism"—or "pinko commie." But when I say that I want all Arizonans to have access to affordable, quality health care, Arizonans agree wholeheartedly. Same basic idea, different language."<ref>{{cite web|title=Kyrsten Sinema on Health Care|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/house/Kyrsten_Sinema_Health_Care.htm|publisher=On the Issues|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref>

====Foreign policy====
After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, Sinema was involved in organizing a Phoenix-area group called the Arizona Alliance for Peaceful Justice (AAPJ). According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', "The group’s mission statement at the time called military action
'an inappropriate response to terrorism' and advocated for using the legal system — not violence — to bring [[Osama bin Laden]] and others to justice." Sinema wrote: "As one of the core organizers against the war from day one (September 12, 2011), I have always and will always continue to oppose war in all its forms."<ref name=hill>{{cite news|last=Lederman|first=Josh|title=Candidate's stance on Afghan, Iraq wars faces scrutiny in Democratic primary|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/dem-primaries/224919-candidates-stance-on-afghan-iraq-wars-faces-scrutiny-in-dem-primary|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=February 5, 2012}}</ref>

Sinema has advocated against the Israeli occupation of the [[Palestinian territories]] and has helped form several groups that oppose the U.S.-Israel alliance. The AAPJ, which Sinema co-founded, has denounced Israel’s “disproportionate” use of “violence and oppression,” decried U.S. military aid to Israel, and protested the expansion of Israeli settlements “into Palestinian lands.” Sinema's activism and views regarding Israel have been criticized by Republicans and Democrats, including Jay Goodlik, a former Special Assistant to [[Bill Clinton]].<ref name=hill/><ref name=beacon>{{cite news|last=Kredo|first=Adam|title=Adult Sinema|url=http://freebeacon.com/national-security/adult-sinema/|accessdate=February 14, 2015|newspaper=Washington Free Beacon|date=2012-04-20}}</ref><ref name=town>{{cite news|last=Benson|first=Guy|title="Moderate" Arizona Democrat Has Deep Ties to Left-Wing Radicals, Obama White House|url=http://townhall.com/tipsheet/guybenson/2012/05/11/meet_kyrsten_sinema|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=Townhall|date=November 5, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=Goodman|first=Alana|title=The Reinvention of an Anti-War Activist|url=http://www.commentarymagazine.com/2012/07/23/the-reinvention-of-an-anti-war-activist-sinema|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=Commentary Magazine|date=2012-07-23}}</ref> Sinema is a former spokesperson for Women in Black, an anti-war group that was founded in part to support Palestinians during the [[First Intifada|Intifada]].<ref name=beacon/><ref>{{cite news|last=Footlik|first=Jay|title=Can Jews believe Kyrsten Sinema?|url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/rosnersdomain/item/guest_post_can_jews_believe_kyrsten_sinema_20120805|accessdate=March 19, 2014|newspaper=Jewish Journal|date=May 8, 2012}}</ref> She supports reducing defense spending.<ref name=issues/>

Sinema opposed [[Arizona SB 1070]]. Sinema argues that mass deportation of illegal immigrants is not an option and supported the [[DREAM Act]]. Sinema believes that "we need to create a tough but fair path to citizenship for undocumented workers that requires them to get right with the law by paying back taxes, paying a fine and learning English as a condition of gaining citizenship." <ref>http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Kyrsten_Sinema_Immigration.htm</ref>

====Refugees====
Sinema voted for the [[American SAFE Act of 2015|SAFE Act]], which expanded the refugee screening process to require signatures from the [[Secretary of Homeland Security]], the [[Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation]], and the [[Director of National Intelligence]] for each refugee entering the country.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sanders|first1=Rebekah|title=Kyrsten Sinema's surprising vote on Syrian refugees|url=http://www.azcentral.com/story/news/politics/immigration/2015/11/19/kyrsten-sinemas-surprising-vote-syrian-refugees/76066450/|website=azcentral|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.4038 - American SAFE Act of 2015|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4038|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=22 November 2015}}</ref>

==Personal life==
On November 17, 2013, Sinema completed an [[Ironman Triathlon]] in a little more than 15 hours. According to ''[[Politico]]'', Sinema was the second active member of Congress—behind Senator [[Jeff Merkley]]—to finish an Ironman; although several sources, such as Triathlete Magazine, consider Sinema the first, since Merkley completed a non-Ironman-branded race.<ref>{{cite web|last=Kopan|first=Tal|title=Rep.
