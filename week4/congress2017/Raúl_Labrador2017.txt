;Health Care
Labrador supports the repeal of the Patient Protection and Affordable Health Care Act because he believes it will raise costs and kill jobs.

;Education

Critics, like Ian Thompson of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] claimed that the bill would "open the door to unprecedented taxpayer-funded discrimination against LGBT people, single mothers, and unmarried couples.".<ref name=mm>{{cite web | url=http://mediamatters.org/research/2015/07/28/the-so-called-first-amendment-defense-act-is-th/204627 | title=The "First Amendment Defense Act" Is The Next Attack on LGBT Rights | work=Media Matters | date=July 28, 2015 | accessdate=December 18, 2015 | author=Percelay, Rachel}}</ref>
