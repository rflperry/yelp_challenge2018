;Political positions
"Top priorities must be creating jobs, getting our economy back on track, and stopping reckless spending that has left our nation with the largest [[Government budget deficit|deficit]] in history," wrote Hastings in response to [[Project Vote Smart]].<ref name="Project Vote Smart">[[Project Vote Smart]], Washington Congressional Election 2010 Political Courage Test</ref> The ''[[Seattle Post-Intelligencer]]'' considers Hastings to be a "down-the-line supporter of the House Republican leadership".<ref name="mostcon"/>

In November 2010 he said that "Promoting new domestic energy production, including in the Arctic, will be a priority" for the Committee.<ref name="LA Times">"Effort aims to block oil drilling in refuge;

;Controversies
Hastings was instrumental in 2002 in building the case that led to the expulsion of Congressman [[James Traficant]] (D-OH) from the United States Congress. As Chairman of the Investigative Subcommittee of the [[United States House Committee on Ethics]], Hastings was tasked with reviewing the file from Traficant's trial and other material to determine if there had been a violation of House rules. Hastings said on the floor of the House, "After considering all of the evidence, I concluded that Mr. Traficant's offenses were so serious and so purposeful that expulsion from the House is the only appropriate sanction". The measure to remove Traficant from the House passed 420-1.<ref>{{cite news|last=Pope|first=Charles|title=Potomac Watch|url=http://www.seattlepi.com/default/article/Potomac-Watch-Doc-Hastings-took-the-lead-in-1092275.php|work=Richard Hastings took the lead in Traficant's expulsion|publisher=Seattle Post-Intelligencer|accessdate=June 27, 2011|date=July 26, 2002}}</ref>

In 1996, lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]] and his firm had as many as 36 contacts with Hasting's office, resulting in as many as 85.57 billed hours regarding the [[Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands]].<ref>1996 CNMI Preston Gates Ellis Invoices</ref> Abramoff bragged to the CNMI of having "excellent" ties to Hastings.<ref>Alicia Mundy, "Pasco Congressman in Rare Spotlight", ''The Seattle Times'', June 10, 2005.</ref> Hastings' 2004 campaign had received $1,000 from Abramoff personally and an additional $5,647 from Abramoff's lobbying firm, which was also one of the largest law firms in the State of Washington, [[Preston Gates]]. Preston Gates, [[Microsoft]]'s law and lobbying firm, also contributed to Washington Democrats during that cycle, including to Seattle's [[Jim McDermott]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Candidate Summary Report|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/cancomsrs/?_04+H2WA04041|work=Richard Hastings|publisher=Federal Elections Commission|accessdate=July 6, 2011}}</ref>

Following Hastings' work that led to Traficant's removal from the House, he was named to the Chairmanship of the United States House Committee on Ethics. Soon after being named Chairman, two senior staff members for the committee were fired, and Hastings attempted to place his office Chief of Staff, Ed Cassidy, onto the Ethics Committee staff. Democrats cast this a partisan move, while Republicans pointed out that such a change in staff is the norm with the naming of a new committee chairman. Hastings came under fire during his chairmanship of the Ethics Committee, due to claims by Democrats of inaction regarding then-House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]]. By rule, the House Ethics Committee's work, votes, and investigative findings are kept strictly confidential.<ref>Alicia Mundy, "Hastings says ethics panel won't investigate DeLay", ''The Seattle Times'', October 6, 2005; "House Ethics Chair Fires Lawyers", ''Associated Press'', February 16, 2005, which can viewed [http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,147833,00.html here]; Mike Allen "House Ethics Panel in Gridlock; Democrats Refuse to Participate Under New GOP Rules," Washington Post, March 11, 2005, Page A02; Alicia Mundy, "Ethics claims target Doc Hastings," Seattle Times, June 25, 2005; Gail Russell Chaddock, "House ethics panel lapses at an awkward time", ''Christian Science Monitor'', April 26, 2005.</ref>

In 2008, Hastings, by now the ranking member of the Ethics Committee, pushed the investigation of [[Charlie Rangel]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Lee and Pershing|first=Christopher and Ben|title=Official Rangel Probe Appears Likely|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/09/18/AR2008091803961.html|accessdate=July 7, 2011|newspaper=Washington Post|date=September 9, 2008}}</ref> A four-person investigative subcommittee was formed with Hastings as co-chair. The subcommittee's subsequent report led to Rangel's loss of the chairmanship of the powerful [[Ways and Means Committee]] and censure by the House in 2010.

===Committee assignments===
* '''[[United States House Committee on Natural Resources|Committee on Natural Resources]]''' (Chairman)
** As Chairman of the full committee, Hastings may serve as an ''[[ex officio]]'' member of all subcommittees.

He switched to ranking member 2007–2009 when the Democrats won the majority for the [[110th United States Congress]]. {{Citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===Legislation sponsored===

The bill would direct the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] to establish at least one Forest Reserve Revenue Area within each unit of the [[United States Forest Service|National Forest System]] designated for sustainable forest management for the production of national forest materials (the sale of trees, portions of trees, or forest products from System lands) and forest reserve revenues (to be derived from the sale of such materials in such an Area).<ref name=sum1526>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1526 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/1526|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=September 17, 2013}}</ref> The bill states that the purpose of an Area is to provide a dependable source of 25% payments and economic activity for each beneficiary county containing System land that was eligible to receive payments through its state under the [[Secure Rural Schools and Community Self-Determination Act of 2000]].<ref name="sum1526"/>
* On June 19, 2014, Hastings introduced the [[Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].<ref name=cbo4899>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 4899|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr4899.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=June 26, 2014}}</ref> The bill is intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.<ref name=HousePassesMarcos>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to increase offshore energy projects|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/210690-house-passes-bill-to-increase-offshore-energy-projects|accessdate=June 26, 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=June 26, 2014}}</ref><ref name=GraeberUPI>{{cite news|last1=Graeber|first1=Daniel J.|title=House measure on gas aimed at lower prices|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/06/27/House-measure-on-gas-aimed-at-lower-prices/9031403872288|accessdate=June 27, 2014|publisher=UPI|date=June 27, 2014}}</ref> Hastings argued that "the current turmoil in Iraq has already caused the price of gasoline to increase, and it serves as an important reminder of why we need to increase production here at home" because it is the "best way to protect ourselves from price spikes caused by international conflicts."<ref name="HousePassesMarcos"/>

==Personal life==
In 1967, Hastings married his wife, Claire, in [[Sacramento, California]]; the couple has three children: Kirsten, Petrina, and Colin.
