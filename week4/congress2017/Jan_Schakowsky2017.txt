==Early life, education and career==
Schakowsky was born '''Janice Danoff''' in 1944 in [[Chicago]], the daughter of Tillie (''née'' Cosnow) and Irwin Danoff.<ref name=bookref1>{{cite book|title=The Jews of Capitol Hill: A Compendium of Jewish Congressional Members|author=Stone, K.F.|date=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810877382|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ACTF56SnaykC&pg=PA549|page=549|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref> Her parents were Jewish immigrants, her father from Lithuania and her mother from Russia.<ref name=bookref1/><ref name="huffingtonpost">{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/12/09/glenn-beck-admonished-by_n_386221.html|title=Glenn Beck Slammed By Polish Group For Butchering Schakowsky's Name|work=[[The Huffington Post]]|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref>

Schakowsky graduated from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] with a B.S. in elementary education where she was a member of [[Delta Phi Epsilon (social)|Delta Phi Epsilon]] sorority.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dphie.org/distinguished.cfm |title=Delta Phi Epsilon International Sorority |publisher=DPhiE.org |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>  She was Program Director of Illinois Public Action, Illinois' largest public interest group, from 1976 to 1985. She then moved to the Illinois State Council of Senior Citizens as executive director for five years until 1990, when she was elected to the [[Illinois House of Representatives]]. She served there until 1998.<ref>{{cite book|last1=Wasniewski|first1=Matthew Andrew|title=Women in Congress, 1917-2006|date=2006|publisher=Government Printing Office|isbn=978-0-16-076753-1|page=908|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wz9OB2xLGecC&lpg=PA908&dq=Illinois%20State%20Council%20of%20Senior%20Citizens%20schakowsky&pg=PA908#v=onepage&q&f=false|language=en}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Schakowsky is among the most [[Progressivism|Progressive]] members of the current U.S. Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/spectrum.xpd |title=GovTrack: The Political Spectrum |publisher=Govtrack.us |date=October 17, 2009 |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> She is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] and frequently earns ratings of between 90 and 100 from liberal and progressive interest groups. In April 2009 Schakowsky pointedly criticized the tax day [[Tea Party protests]], asserting that they were ''"an effort to mislead the public about the Obama economic plan that cut taxes for 95 percent of Americans and creates 3.5&nbsp;million jobs ... It's despicable that right-wing Republicans would attempt to cheapen a significant, honorable moment of American history with a shameful political stunt"'', she stated.<ref>Zimmerman, Eric (April 16, 2009). [http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/lawmaker-news/36720-schakowsky-tea-parties-despicable "Schakowsky: Tea parties 'despicable'"], TheHill.com; accessed October 22, 2016.</ref>

In February 2013, Schakowsky indicated her support for banning [[assault weapon]]s as only a beginning step towards more gun control measures including a ban on handguns.<ref>{{cite web|title=Democrat Congresswoman: Assault Weapons Ban 'Just the Beginning'|url=http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2013/03/11/schakowsky-assault-weapons-ban-is-just-the-beginning/|publisher=Breitbart|date=March 11, 2013|first= Joel B. |last=Pollak}}</ref>

As co-chair of the [[Congressional Caucus for Women's Issues]], Schakowsky has been known for her support of women's issues while in Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/07/09/jan-schakowsky-leads-the-fight-for-women.html |title=Jan Schakowsky Leads the Fight for Women |work=US News and World Report |author=Rettig, Jessica |date=July 9, 2010}}</ref>

''[[The Nation]]'' endorsed her for vice president in the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], stating that she is 'the truest heir to [[Paul Wellstone]] in the current Congress'.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thenation.com/blogs/thebeat?bid=1&pid=1295 |title=The Beat |work=The Nation |location=Abu Dhabi |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref> She was, however, not selected as [[John Kerry]]'s running mate. In response to concerns about electoral irregularities in the state of [[Ohio]] during the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]], Schakowsky was one of 31 members of the [[United States House of Representatives]] who voted not to accept Ohio's [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s.<ref name="house">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 7|publisher=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref>

[[File:20070210 Jan Schakowsky and Jeffrey Schoenberg.jpg|thumb|Schakowsky and [[Jeffrey Schoenberg]] in [[Springfield, Illinois]] on the day of the [[Barack Obama]]'s presidential candidacy announcement, 10 February 2007]]
Schakowsky has been outspoken in her opposition to the [[Iraq War]]. She was one of the earliest and most emphatic supporters of U.S. Senator [[Barack Obama]] prior to his victory in the 2004 Illinois Democratic primary election, and actively supported his bid for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination.<ref>[http://www.progressive.org/mag_wx010408 "Obama's Day in Iowa"], by Matthew Rothschild, ''[[The Progressive]],'' January 4, 2008.</ref>

In hearings held by the House Energy and Commerce Subcomittee in July 2006, Schakowsky expressed concern that a report from the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] showing discrepancies among scientists studying [[global warming]] might be "used in a way to discredit the whole notion that our country and the rest of the industrialized and developing world ought to do anything about global warming".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.tcsdaily.com/article.aspx?id=072606G |title=Science In the House of Pain |publisher=TCS Daily |date= |accessdate=July 16, 2010}}</ref>

Schakowsky indicated interest in replacing [[Barack Obama]] in the United States Senate.<ref>{{cite news | title=Schakowsky among those wanting Senate seat | date=November 5, 2008 | url=http://archives.chicagotribune.com/2008/nov/05/local/chi-ap-il-obamasuccessor-sc | agency=Associated Press | accessdate=November 11, 2008 | work=Chicago Tribune}}</ref> Before his arrest, Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]] had reportedly been considering Schakowsky among at least six candidates to fill the vacancy. Schakowsky was one of the first figures in Illinois to voice interest in running in a special election to replace Obama.<ref>[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/12/12/1001495/shakowsky-throws-her-hat-in Schakowsky throws her hat in], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), December 12, 2008.</ref>

In April 2009, she stated her support for a [[Public health insurance option|public option in health insurance]], arguing that it would put [[health insurance]] companies out of business and lead to [[single-payer health care]], which she supports.<ref>[http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/09228/990934-373.stm Post-gazette.com, The health-care shuffle], Jack Kelly, ''[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]]'', August 16, 2009</ref>

In March 2010 Schakowsky was appointed by Speaker Pelosi to President Obama's [[National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform]], commonly known as the deficit commission.<ref>[http://dailycaller.com/2010/03/24/pelosi-appoints-three-fiscal-commission-participants/ Pelosi Appoints Three Fiscal Commission Participants], ''The Daily Caller'', March 24, 2010</ref>

In June 2011, Jan Schakowsky condemned the [[Progressive Democrats of America]] for their role in the upcoming [[Gaza Flotilla]] 2.<ref>{{cite web |url = http://www.breitbart.com/big-government/2011/06/14/jan-schakowsky-condemns-her-closest-allies-for-their-role-in-hamas-flotilla/|title = Jan Schakowsky Condemns Her Closest Allies For Their Role In Hamas Flotilla|publisher = Breitbart}}</ref>{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=opinion piece|date=November 2015}}

In March 2015, Schakowsky was criticized by the [[Orthodox Union]] after saying that Jewish politician [[Joel Pollak]] was a "Jewish, Orthodox, Tea Party Republican" at a [[J Street]] event. She later apologized for her comments.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/217417/congresswoman-apologizes-referring-to-political-ri|title=Congresswoman Apologizes Referring to Political Rival as 'Orthodox Jew'|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015 |newspaper=[[The Jewish Daily Forward]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/193127#.VRNf4sofp9A|title=Democrat Apologizes for 'Orthodox Jew' Slur at J Street Event|first=Ari|last=Yashar|date=March 24, 2015|accessdate=March 30, 2015|publisher=[[Arutz Sheva]]}}</ref>

===Boycott of Netanyahu's speech to Congress===
In March 2015, Schakowsky did not attend the [[Prime Minister of Israel]], [[Benjamin Netanyahu]]'s speech to congress, because, she wrote in the ''[[Huffington Post]]'', it could scuttle delicate negotiations with Iran: ''"The prime minister wants the negotiations to end, and his purpose in speaking to the Congress is to convince us that the president is about to agree to a deal that threatens Israel's existence. He believes the president is naïve in thinking that he and the P5+1 can achieve any agreement that will stop Iran from rushing toward a bomb ... What is the alternative to an agreement? Yes, the United States will increase sanctions. But does anyone doubt that Iran will build a nuclear weapon regardless of sanctions? Then the choices will be ugly: accepting a nuclear-weaponized Iran or accepting military action (i.e., war with Iran). For me it's obvious that we must give the negotiations a chance. And, in the meantime, Iran has essentially halted its weapons program under the Joint Plan of Action while the talks are ongoing."''<ref>"An Israel Supporter Who Won't Be at the Prime Minister's Speech", ''Huffington Post'', February 26, 2015.</ref>{{third-party inline|reason=independent reliable secondary source needed for noteworthiness|date=November 2015}}

==Political campaigns==

===1998===
[[Sidney R. Yates|Sidney Yates]], who had represented the 9th District since 1949 (except for an unsuccessful run for the [[United States Senate|Senate]] in 1962), had announced in 1996 that he wouldn't run for re-election in 1998.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} Schakowsky easily won the Democratic primary, which all but assured her of election in the heavily Democratic 9th. She won in November with 75 percent of the vote and has easily won reelection four times with 70 percent or more of the vote. She is only the third person to represent the district since 1949.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}
