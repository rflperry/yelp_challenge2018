====Health care====
In June 2014, Nolan and Republican [[David McKinley]] introduced the Health Care Fairness and Flexibility Act, which would delay an [[Affordable Care Act]] fee on every person covered by large self-insured employers and insurance companies.

====Foreign policy====
Nolan was one of four members of Congress to vote against the 2014 Veterans Affairs appropriations bill. The bill allocates $73.3 billion to veterans programs and military construction projects, "$1.4 billion more than what Congress budgeted last year." In a statement, Nolan said, "I voted against the bill in protest, because it under-funds veterans health and benefit programs, while shoveling billions of new dollars into unnecessary new military construction in places all around the world where American presence and American resources do not belong."<ref name="veterans">{{cite web|last=Henry |first=Devin |url=http://www.minnpost.com/dc-dispatches/2013/06/nolans-protest-vote-one-four-against-va-budget-bill |title=Nolan's 'protest' vote one of four against VA budget bill |publisher=MinnPost |date=2013-06-05 |accessdate=2013-12-13}}</ref>
