Schiff has become an influential voice for his party in the House of Representatives on foreign policy and national security issues.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neuman|first1=Johanna|title=Congressman Is Gaining a Name in Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-schiff20jun20-story.html|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=5 June 2005}}</ref> He serves as Ranking Member of the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. He is currently on leave from the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] which he joined in 2007. He previously served on the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Committee]], and serves on the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.

==Early life, education and career==
He was born in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]], to a traditional [[Jewish]] family, and moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] during high school.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peschiutta|first1=Claudia|title=Meet Adam Schiff|url=http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2000-07-22/news/export46525_1_adam-schiff-democrats-harvard-law-school|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Glendale News-Press|date=22 July 2000}}</ref> He received a political science degree from [[Stanford University]] and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]].

After receiving his degree from Harvard, Schiff was a lawyer, working as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles branch of the [[U.S. Attorney's Office]]. During his time as an assistant U.S. Attorney, he gained attention by prosecuting a case against [[Richard Miller (agent)|Richard Miller]], a former FBI agent convicted of "passing secret documents to the Soviet Union in exchange for a promised $65,000 in gold and cash."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Soble|first1=Ronald|title=Ex-FBI Agent Miller Guilty of Espionage|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-10/news/mn-1957_1_fbi-agent|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=10 October 1990}}</ref> The first time Miller was tried, it resulted in a hung jury; the second time, it resulted in a conviction overturned on appeal,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleeman|first1=Michael|title=THIRD ESPIONAGE TRIAL BEGINS FOR FORMER FBI AGENT|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Third-Espionage-Trial-Begins-for-Former-FBI-Agent/id-59774f086411dbd2a5adcd1eaa91ce54|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=22 August 1990}}</ref> and the third time he was convicted.

==California State Senate==
Schiff was elected to the [[California State Senate]] after two unsuccessful attempts in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=James|title=Adam Schiff Enjoying Getting to Know West Hollywood|url=http://patch.com/california/westhollywood/adam-schiff-enjoying-getting-to-know-west-hollywood|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Patch-AOL|date=30 August 2012}}</ref>  He chaired that body's judiciary committee during his one term.

During his tenure in the state senate, Schiff authored Senate Bill 1847, Chapter 1021. Signed into law in 1998, this created the Pasadena Blue Line Authority, which continued work on the stalled then-Blue Line light rail extension to Pasadena, which would later be named the [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Gold Line]] instead.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Schiff is currently serving his eighth term in Congress.

===Armenian Genocide===
Schiff has been a leading voice in [[Armenian-American]] issues; he claims to have over 70,000 Armenian-Americans in his district.<ref>Washington Post: "Worse than irrelevant: A congressional resolution about massacres in Turkey 90 years ago endangers present-day U.S. security", p. A16, October 10, 2007</ref><ref>Wall Street Journal: "Political History", Review & Outlook, October 2, 2007</ref> He has strongly pushed for signing of the [[US House Resolution 106]] recognizing the [[Armenian Genocide]]. On October 11, 2007, the resolution sponsored by Schiff was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-10-11-voa71.cfm |title=US House Speaker: Armenian Genocide Measure Will Go Forward |accessdate=2007-10-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012155707/http://voanews.com/english/2007-10-11-voa71.cfm |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.-Turkey relations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL1262442020071012 |title=Turkey's PM says U.S. relations in danger |accessdate=2007-10-12 | work=Reuters | date=October 12, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013151132/http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL1262442020071012| archivedate= 13 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The resolution was again approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4, 2010 by a 23-22 margin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-armenian-genocide5-2010mar05,0,6057070.story |title=House panel narrowly passes recognition of Armenian genocide |accessdate=2010-03-04 | work=Los Angeles Times |first1=Richard |last1=Simon |first2=Teresa |last2=Watanabe |date=March 5, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100307033355/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-armenian-genocide5-2010mar05,0,6057070.story| archivedate= 7 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He continues to reintroduce the resolution each subsequent Congress.

===Campaign finance reform===

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] strike down [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] legislation in the [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]] and [[McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission]] cases, Schiff introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn both decisions, H.J.Res 31, drafted by Harvard Law School Constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wells|first1=Jason|title=Rep.

===Helicopter noise===

Beginning with Rep. [[Howard Berman]] before he was defeated for reelection, Schiff has worked on reducing unwanted helicopter noise across Los Angeles County by proposing legislation to force the [[FAA]] to study and regulate helicopter noise in Los Angeles, the Helicopter Noise Relief Act.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Aguilar|first1=Erika|title=Congressman Schiff says he will reintroduce helicopter noise bill|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/news/2012/12/07/11459/congressman-schiff-says-he-will-reintroduce-helico/|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Southern California Public Radio|date=7 December 2012}}</ref> After reintroducing his legislation, Schiff has worked with Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] to push the FAA to act, and together they attached a provision in the 2014 omnibus appropriations package directing the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and FAA to address helicopter noise in Los Angeles County skies.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Richard|title=Spending bill to likely give L.A. $130 million for key rail projects|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-transportation-funding-los-angeles-20140114-story.html|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=14 January 2014}}</ref> The FAA has announced that they will create a county-wide helicopter noise public complaint system, the first step towards regulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAA To Create Public Complaint System For Helicopter Noise|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/09/22/faa-to-create-public-complaint-system-for-helicopter-noise/|website=CBS Los Angeles|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

===Intelligence and surveillance reform===

Schiff has been a prominent supporter of surveillance reforms, especially in the wake of the leaks of classified intelligence by [[Edward Snowden]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holman|first1=Kwame|title=Crusader for More Transparency on Intelligence Sees Risk and Reward From Snowden Leaks|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/crusader-for-more-transparency-on-intelligence-sees-risk-and-reward-from-snowden-leaks/|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=PBS|date=2 July 2013}}</ref> In 2007, in response to disclosure of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]], Schiff and Rep. [[Jeff Flake]] offered a successful amendment in the House of Representatives to clarify that the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] is the exclusive means for collecting foreign intelligence information within the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Nate|title=House reaffirms FISA as "exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted"|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2007/05/house-reaffirms-fisa-as-exclusive-means-by-which-electronic-surveillance-may-be-conducted/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Schiff has been a critic of the bulk collection of telephone metadata by the [[National Security Agency]]. In January 2014, Schiff introduced the Telephone Metadata Reform Act,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shabad|first1=Rebecca|title=Schiff unveils NSA metadata reform bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/195381-schiff-unveils-nsa-metadata-reform-bill|accessdate=7 December 2014|agency=The Hill|date=14 January 2014}}</ref> which would prohibit the bulk collection of domestic phone records. Schiff has also introduced several bills aimed at reforming the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], including a bill to require outside counsel to be appointed to argue for privacy and civil liberties protections in certain cases before the Court.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sledge|first1=Matt|title=Adam Schiff Prepares FISA Court Bill To Create Special Privacy Advocate|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/adam-schiff-fisa-court_n_3653946.html|website=Huffington Post}}</ref>

===Investigation of Benghazi attack===

Schiff was appointed to the [[United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi|House Select Committee on Benghazi]] in 2014 by [[Nancy Pelosi]] to serve as one of the five Democrats on the Committee.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Jonathan|title=Pelosi Picks 5 Democrats for Panel on Benghazi|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/us/politics/bucking-deputies-pelosi-picks-5-democrats-for-benghazi-panel.html?_r=0|accessdate=23 August 2014|agency=New York Times|date=22 May 2014}}</ref> Schiff had participated in the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] investigation into the attacks on the Benghazi diplomatic compound, which found that the initial talking points provided by the intelligence community were flawed but without an intention to deceive and that diplomatic facilities across the world lacked adequate security.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Dierdre|title=Benghazi probe presses ahead despite new report|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/politics/benghazi-select-committee/index.html|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=6 August 2014}}</ref> The report's findings were unanimous and bipartisan. Before he was appointed as a Member of the Benghazi Select Committee, Schiff called the establishment of a select committee to investigate the 2012 attack a "colossal waste of time," and said Democratic leaders should not appoint any members, stating: "I think it's just a tremendous red herring and a waste of taxpayer resources."<ref name=Hicks>{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Josh|title=Schiff: Benghazi select committee a âcolossal waste of timeâ|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/04/schiff-benghazi-select-committee-a-colossal-waste-of-time/|accessdate=10 May 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 May 2014}}</ref> Despite those reservations, he still accepted an appointment to the Committee because if he felt he "could add value, [he] would serve."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mikailian|first1=Arin|title=House appoints Schiff to Benghazi investigation committee|url=http://www.burbankleader.com/news/tn-blr-house-appoints-schiff-to-benghazi-investigation-committee-20140524,0,7139046.story|accessdate=23 August 2014|agency=Burbank Leader|date=24 May 2014}}</ref>

===Press freedom===

Schiff formed the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press in 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=The Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press Calls on Secretary of State Rice to Urge Russia to Protect Journalist Rights|url=http://schiff.house.gov/s2006/the-congressional-caucus-for-freedom-of-the-press-calls-on-secretary-of-state-rice-to-urge-russia-to-protect-journalist-rights/|website=Schiff Congressional Website|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> aimed at advancing press freedom around the world.  The Caucus proposed the [[Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act]] and it was originally introduced to Congress by Schiff and Rep. [[Mike Pence]] (R., Ind.) and by Sen. [[Christopher Dodd]] (D., Conn.) on October 1, 2009 in response to the murder of [[Daniel Pearl]] by terrorists in Pakistan.<ref name=CypressTimes>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecypresstimes.com/article/News/National_News/PRESIDENT_OBAMA_SIGNS_THE_DANIEL_PEARL_FREEDOM_OF_THE_PRESS_ACT/30207|title=President Obama Signs the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act|work=The Cypress Times|accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=WallStJournal>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/17/obama-signs-daniel-pearl-press-freedom-act/|title=Obama Signs Pearl Press-Freedom Act|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2010-12-01|first=Laura|last=Meckler|date=2010-05-17}}</ref> The legislation requires the [[United States Department of State]] to expand its scrutiny of [[news media]] [[intimidation]] and [[freedom of the press]] restrictions during its annual report on [[human rights]] in each country.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|title=U.S. to Promote Press Freedom |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY}}</ref> After its introduction, the act passed through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with a vote of 403 to 12 and passed unanimously in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]; however, a provision requiring the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Department of Stateâs Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor in consultation with the Undersecretary for Public Affairs and Public Diplomacy, to establish a grant program aiming to promote freedom of the press worldwide.<ref name=WallStJournal/> On May 17, 2010 President Barack Obama, accompanied by the Pearl family, signed into law the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meckler|first1=Laura|title=Obama Signs Daniel Pearl Press Freedom Act|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/17/obama-signs-daniel-pearl-press-freedom-act/|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=17 May 2010}}</ref>

===Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen===
In 2015, Schiff supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], saying: "The military action by Saudi Arabia and its partners was necessitated by the illegal action of the Houthi rebels and their Iranian backers. ... But ultimately, a negotiated end to this crisis is the only way to restore order in Yemen and shrink the space for terrorism."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/27/saudi-arabia-gets-bipartisan-backing-for-yemen-airstrikes |title=Saudi Arabia Gets Bipartisan Backing for Yemen Airstrikes |work=U.S. News. |date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>

===War authorization reform and authorization against ISIS===

After the President's speech at the [[National Defense University]] examining the U.S. war powers during the [[War on Terror]], Schiff introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2001 [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], the legislation passed in the days after the [[September 11 attacks]] to combat [[Al Qaeda]], because he felt that "the current AUMF is outdated and straining at the edges to justify the use of force outside the war theater."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Spencer|title=Congressman Preps Bill to End Terror War Authority|url=http://www.wired.com/2013/05/schiff-aumf/|website=Wired|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> The bill, introduced with Rep.

==Congressional campaigns==

===2000===

In 2000, Schiff challenged Republican incumbent [[Jim Rogan]] in what was then the 27th District.  The district had once been a Republican stronghold, but had been trending Democratic since the early 1990s.  In what was the most expensive House race ever at the time<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topraces.php?cycle=2000&Display=allcands |title=Most Expensive Races 2000 |author=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> (several elections in 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topraces.php?cycle=2006&Display=allcands |title=Most Expensive Races 2006 |author=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> and 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topraces.php?cycle=2008&Display=allcands |title=Most Expensive Races 2008 |author=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> later eclipsed it), Schiff unseated Rogan, taking 53 percent of the vote to Rogan's 44 percent.  He became only the second Democrat to represent this district since its creation in 1913 (it was the 9th District from 1913 to 1933, the 11th District from 1933â43, the 20th District from 1943 to 1975, the 22nd District from 1975 to 1993, and the 27th District from 1993 to 2003).

After the 2000 census, the district was renumbered as the 29th and made significantly more Democratic.  As a result, Schiff has never faced another contest nearly as close as his 2000 bid, and has been reelected seven times.  His district became even more Democratic after the 2010 census, when it was renumbered as the 28th and pushed into Los Angeles itself.

===2010, 2012 and 2014===

In 2010, Schiff defeated Tea Party backed Republican John Colbert for a 6th term.<ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16512974] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184506/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16512974 |date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> In 2012, he defeated Republican Phil Jennerjahn.<ref>http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2012-11-07/news/tn-gnp-1107-gatto-liu-schiff-handily-hold-on-to-their-seats_1_phil-jennerjahn-schiff-carol-liu</ref> In 2014, he defeated independent candidate Steve Stokes.

'''Adam Bennett Schiff''' (born June 22, 1960) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|28}}. He has served in Congress since 2001. He is a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. Schiff represented the 27th and 29th Districts between 2003 and 2013, which included the areas of [[Alhambra, California|Alhambra]], [[Altadena, California|Altadena]], [[San Gabriel, California|San Gabriel]], [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], [[South Pasadena, California|South Pasadena]], [[Temple City, California|Temple City]], [[Monterey Park, California|Monterey Park]] and [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]]. In 2010, his district was re-districted to include new areas including [[Hollywood, California|Hollywood]], [[Echo Park, Los Angeles|Echo Park]], [[Hollywood Hills, Los Angeles|Hollywood Hills]], [[La Canada Flintridge, California|La Canada Flintridge]], [[La Crescenta-Montrose, California|La Crescenta]], [[Los Feliz, Los Angeles|Los Feliz]], [[Silver Lake, Los Angeles|Silver Lake]], [[Sunland-Tujunga, Los Angeles|Sunland-Tujunga]], and [[West Hollywood, California|West Hollywood]], in addition to areas he represented before like [[Burbank, California|Burbank]], [[Glendale, California|Glendale]], and the western part of [[Pasadena, California|Pasadena]].

Schiff has become an influential voice for his party in the House of Representatives on foreign policy and national security issues.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Neuman|first1=Johanna|title=Congressman Is Gaining a Name in Foreign Affairs|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/politics/la-me-schiff20jun20-story.html|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=5 June 2005}}</ref> He serves as Ranking Member of the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. He is currently on leave from the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] which he joined in 2007. He previously served on the [[United States House Foreign Affairs Committee]], and serves on the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Subcommittee of the Appropriations Committee.

==Early life, education and career==
He was born in [[Framingham, Massachusetts|Framingham]], [[Massachusetts]], to a traditional [[Jewish]] family, and moved to [[Oakland, California|Oakland]] during high school.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peschiutta|first1=Claudia|title=Meet Adam Schiff|url=http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2000-07-22/news/export46525_1_adam-schiff-democrats-harvard-law-school|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Glendale News-Press|date=22 July 2000}}</ref> He received a political science degree from [[Stanford University]] and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] degree from [[Harvard Law School]].

After receiving his degree from Harvard, Schiff was a lawyer, working as a prosecutor in the Los Angeles branch of the [[U.S. Attorney's Office]]. During his time as an assistant U.S. Attorney, he gained attention by prosecuting a case against [[Richard Miller (agent)|Richard Miller]], a former FBI agent convicted of "passing secret documents to the Soviet Union in exchange for a promised $65,000 in gold and cash."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Soble|first1=Ronald|title=Ex-FBI Agent Miller Guilty of Espionage|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-10-10/news/mn-1957_1_fbi-agent|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=10 October 1990}}</ref> The first time Miller was tried, it resulted in a hung jury; the second time, it resulted in a conviction overturned on appeal,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Fleeman|first1=Michael|title=THIRD ESPIONAGE TRIAL BEGINS FOR FORMER FBI AGENT|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Third-Espionage-Trial-Begins-for-Former-FBI-Agent/id-59774f086411dbd2a5adcd1eaa91ce54|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Associated Press|date=22 August 1990}}</ref> and the third time he was convicted.

==California State Senate==
Schiff was elected to the [[California State Senate]] after two unsuccessful attempts in 1996.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mills|first1=James|title=Adam Schiff Enjoying Getting to Know West Hollywood|url=http://patch.com/california/westhollywood/adam-schiff-enjoying-getting-to-know-west-hollywood|accessdate=22 August 2014|agency=Patch-AOL|date=30 August 2012}}</ref>  He chaired that body's judiciary committee during his one term.

During his tenure in the state senate, Schiff authored Senate Bill 1847, Chapter 1021. Signed into law in 1998, this created the Pasadena Blue Line Authority, which continued work on the stalled then-Blue Line light rail extension to Pasadena, which would later be named the [[Gold Line (Los Angeles Metro)|Gold Line]] instead.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

Schiff is currently serving his eighth term in Congress.

===Armenian Genocide===
Schiff has been a leading voice in [[Armenian-American]] issues; he claims to have over 70,000 Armenian-Americans in his district.<ref>Washington Post: "Worse than irrelevant: A congressional resolution about massacres in Turkey 90 years ago endangers present-day U.S. security", p. A16, October 10, 2007</ref><ref>Wall Street Journal: "Political History", Review & Outlook, October 2, 2007</ref> He has strongly pushed for signing of the [[US House Resolution 106]] recognizing the [[Armenian Genocide]]. On October 11, 2007, the resolution sponsored by Schiff was approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/english/2007-10-11-voa71.cfm |title=US House Speaker: Armenian Genocide Measure Will Go Forward |accessdate=2007-10-11 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071012155707/http://voanews.com/english/2007-10-11-voa71.cfm |archivedate=2007-10-12 |deadurl=no |df= }}</ref> Turkey's prime minister said that approval of the resolution would endanger U.S.-Turkey relations.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL1262442020071012 |title=Turkey's PM says U.S. relations in danger |accessdate=2007-10-12 | work=Reuters | date=October 12, 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071013151132/http://uk.reuters.com/article/oilRpt/idUKL1262442020071012| archivedate= 13 October 2007 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>  The resolution was again approved by the House Foreign Affairs Committee on March 4, 2010 by a 23-22 margin.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-armenian-genocide5-2010mar05,0,6057070.story |title=House panel narrowly passes recognition of Armenian genocide |accessdate=2010-03-04 | work=Los Angeles Times |first1=Richard |last1=Simon |first2=Teresa |last2=Watanabe |date=March 5, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100307033355/http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-armenian-genocide5-2010mar05,0,6057070.story| archivedate= 7 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref> He continues to reintroduce the resolution each subsequent Congress.

===Campaign finance reform===

After the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] strike down [[campaign finance reform in the United States|campaign finance reform]] legislation in the [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]] and [[McCutcheon v. Federal Election Commission]] cases, Schiff introduced a constitutional amendment to overturn both decisions, H.J.Res 31, drafted by Harvard Law School Constitutional scholar Laurence H. Tribe.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Wells|first1=Jason|title=Rep.

===Helicopter noise===

Beginning with Rep. [[Howard Berman]] before he was defeated for reelection, Schiff has worked on reducing unwanted helicopter noise across Los Angeles County by proposing legislation to force the [[FAA]] to study and regulate helicopter noise in Los Angeles, the Helicopter Noise Relief Act.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Aguilar|first1=Erika|title=Congressman Schiff says he will reintroduce helicopter noise bill|url=http://www.scpr.org/blogs/news/2012/12/07/11459/congressman-schiff-says-he-will-reintroduce-helico/|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Southern California Public Radio|date=7 December 2012}}</ref> After reintroducing his legislation, Schiff has worked with Senator [[Dianne Feinstein]] to push the FAA to act, and together they attached a provision in the 2014 omnibus appropriations package directing the Secretary of the Department of Transportation and FAA to address helicopter noise in Los Angeles County skies.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Simon|first1=Richard|title=Spending bill to likely give L.A. $130 million for key rail projects|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-transportation-funding-los-angeles-20140114-story.html|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Los Angeles Times|date=14 January 2014}}</ref> The FAA has announced that they will create a county-wide helicopter noise public complaint system, the first step towards regulation.<ref>{{cite web|title=FAA To Create Public Complaint System For Helicopter Noise|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2014/09/22/faa-to-create-public-complaint-system-for-helicopter-noise/|website=CBS Los Angeles|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref>

===Intelligence and surveillance reform===

Schiff has been a prominent supporter of surveillance reforms, especially in the wake of the leaks of classified intelligence by [[Edward Snowden]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Holman|first1=Kwame|title=Crusader for More Transparency on Intelligence Sees Risk and Reward From Snowden Leaks|url=http://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/crusader-for-more-transparency-on-intelligence-sees-risk-and-reward-from-snowden-leaks/|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=PBS|date=2 July 2013}}</ref> In 2007, in response to disclosure of the [[Terrorist Surveillance Program]], Schiff and Rep. [[Jeff Flake]] offered a successful amendment in the House of Representatives to clarify that the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act]] is the exclusive means for collecting foreign intelligence information within the United States.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Nate|title=House reaffirms FISA as "exclusive means by which electronic surveillance may be conducted"|url=http://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2007/05/house-reaffirms-fisa-as-exclusive-means-by-which-electronic-surveillance-may-be-conducted/|website=Ars Technica|accessdate=7 December 2014}}</ref> Schiff has been a critic of the bulk collection of telephone metadata by the [[National Security Agency]]. In January 2014, Schiff introduced the Telephone Metadata Reform Act,<ref>{{cite news|last1=Shabad|first1=Rebecca|title=Schiff unveils NSA metadata reform bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/195381-schiff-unveils-nsa-metadata-reform-bill|accessdate=7 December 2014|agency=The Hill|date=14 January 2014}}</ref> which would prohibit the bulk collection of domestic phone records. Schiff has also introduced several bills aimed at reforming the [[Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court]], including a bill to require outside counsel to be appointed to argue for privacy and civil liberties protections in certain cases before the Court.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Sledge|first1=Matt|title=Adam Schiff Prepares FISA Court Bill To Create Special Privacy Advocate|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/25/adam-schiff-fisa-court_n_3653946.html|website=Huffington Post}}</ref>

===Investigation of Benghazi attack===

Schiff was appointed to the [[United States House Select Committee on Events Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attack in Benghazi|House Select Committee on Benghazi]] in 2014 by [[Nancy Pelosi]] to serve as one of the five Democrats on the Committee.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Weisman|first1=Jonathan|title=Pelosi Picks 5 Democrats for Panel on Benghazi|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2014/05/22/us/politics/bucking-deputies-pelosi-picks-5-democrats-for-benghazi-panel.html?_r=0|accessdate=23 August 2014|agency=New York Times|date=22 May 2014}}</ref> Schiff had participated in the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] investigation into the attacks on the Benghazi diplomatic compound, which found that the initial talking points provided by the intelligence community were flawed but without an intention to deceive and that diplomatic facilities across the world lacked adequate security.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Walsh|first1=Dierdre|title=Benghazi probe presses ahead despite new report|url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/08/06/politics/benghazi-select-committee/index.html|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=6 August 2014}}</ref> The report's findings were unanimous and bipartisan. Before he was appointed as a Member of the Benghazi Select Committee, Schiff called the establishment of a select committee to investigate the 2012 attack a "colossal waste of time," and said Democratic leaders should not appoint any members, stating: "I think it's just a tremendous red herring and a waste of taxpayer resources."<ref name=Hicks>{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Josh|title=Schiff: Benghazi select committee a âcolossal waste of timeâ|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/05/04/schiff-benghazi-select-committee-a-colossal-waste-of-time/|accessdate=10 May 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=4 May 2014}}</ref> Despite those reservations, he still accepted an appointment to the Committee because if he felt he "could add value, [he] would serve."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mikailian|first1=Arin|title=House appoints Schiff to Benghazi investigation committee|url=http://www.burbankleader.com/news/tn-blr-house-appoints-schiff-to-benghazi-investigation-committee-20140524,0,7139046.story|accessdate=23 August 2014|agency=Burbank Leader|date=24 May 2014}}</ref>

===Press freedom===

Schiff formed the bipartisan, bicameral Congressional Caucus for the Freedom of the Press in 2006<ref>{{cite web|title=The Congressional Caucus for Freedom of the Press Calls on Secretary of State Rice to Urge Russia to Protect Journalist Rights|url=http://schiff.house.gov/s2006/the-congressional-caucus-for-freedom-of-the-press-calls-on-secretary-of-state-rice-to-urge-russia-to-protect-journalist-rights/|website=Schiff Congressional Website|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> aimed at advancing press freedom around the world.  The Caucus proposed the [[Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act]] and it was originally introduced to Congress by Schiff and Rep. [[Mike Pence]] (R., Ind.) and by Sen. [[Christopher Dodd]] (D., Conn.) on October 1, 2009 in response to the murder of [[Daniel Pearl]] by terrorists in Pakistan.<ref name=CypressTimes>{{cite web|url=http://www.thecypresstimes.com/article/News/National_News/PRESIDENT_OBAMA_SIGNS_THE_DANIEL_PEARL_FREEDOM_OF_THE_PRESS_ACT/30207|title=President Obama Signs the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act|work=The Cypress Times|accessdate=2010-12-01}}</ref><ref name=WallStJournal>{{cite news|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/17/obama-signs-daniel-pearl-press-freedom-act/|title=Obama Signs Pearl Press-Freedom Act|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=2010-12-01|first=Laura|last=Meckler|date=2010-05-17}}</ref> The legislation requires the [[United States Department of State]] to expand its scrutiny of [[news media]] [[intimidation]] and [[freedom of the press]] restrictions during its annual report on [[human rights]] in each country.<ref name=NYTimes>{{cite news|title=U.S. to Promote Press Freedom |newspaper=The New York Times |location=New York, NY}}</ref> After its introduction, the act passed through the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] with a vote of 403 to 12 and passed unanimously in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]; however, a provision requiring the Secretary of State, in coordination with the Department of Stateâs Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor in consultation with the Undersecretary for Public Affairs and Public Diplomacy, to establish a grant program aiming to promote freedom of the press worldwide.<ref name=WallStJournal/> On May 17, 2010 President Barack Obama, accompanied by the Pearl family, signed into law the Daniel Pearl Freedom of the Press Act.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Meckler|first1=Laura|title=Obama Signs Daniel Pearl Press Freedom Act|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/05/17/obama-signs-daniel-pearl-press-freedom-act/|accessdate=9 December 2014|agency=Wall Street Journal|date=17 May 2010}}</ref>

===Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen===
In 2015, Schiff supported the [[Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen]], saying: "The military action by Saudi Arabia and its partners was necessitated by the illegal action of the Houthi rebels and their Iranian backers. ... But ultimately, a negotiated end to this crisis is the only way to restore order in Yemen and shrink the space for terrorism."<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2015/03/27/saudi-arabia-gets-bipartisan-backing-for-yemen-airstrikes |title=Saudi Arabia Gets Bipartisan Backing for Yemen Airstrikes |work=U.S. News. |date=March 27, 2015}}</ref>

===War authorization reform and authorization against ISIS===

After the President's speech at the [[National Defense University]] examining the U.S. war powers during the [[War on Terror]], Schiff introduced bipartisan legislation to repeal the 2001 [[Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists]], the legislation passed in the days after the [[September 11 attacks]] to combat [[Al Qaeda]], because he felt that "the current AUMF is outdated and straining at the edges to justify the use of force outside the war theater."<ref>{{cite web|last1=Ackerman|first1=Spencer|title=Congressman Preps Bill to End Terror War Authority|url=http://www.wired.com/2013/05/schiff-aumf/|website=Wired|accessdate=9 December 2014}}</ref> The bill, introduced with Rep.

==Congressional campaigns==

===2000===

In 2000, Schiff challenged Republican incumbent [[Jim Rogan]] in what was then the 27th District.  The district had once been a Republican stronghold, but had been trending Democratic since the early 1990s.  In what was the most expensive House race ever at the time<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topraces.php?cycle=2000&Display=allcands |title=Most Expensive Races 2000 |author=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> (several elections in 2006<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topraces.php?cycle=2006&Display=allcands |title=Most Expensive Races 2006 |author=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> and 2008<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.opensecrets.org/bigpicture/topraces.php?cycle=2008&Display=allcands |title=Most Expensive Races 2008 |author=Center for Responsive Politics |accessdate=9 April 2012}}</ref> later eclipsed it), Schiff unseated Rogan, taking 53 percent of the vote to Rogan's 44 percent.  He became only the second Democrat to represent this district since its creation in 1913 (it was the 9th District from 1913 to 1933, the 11th District from 1933â43, the 20th District from 1943 to 1975, the 22nd District from 1975 to 1993, and the 27th District from 1993 to 2003).

After the 2000 census, the district was renumbered as the 29th and made significantly more Democratic.  As a result, Schiff has never faced another contest nearly as close as his 2000 bid, and has been reelected seven times.  His district became even more Democratic after the 2010 census, when it was renumbered as the 28th and pushed into Los Angeles itself.

===2010, 2012 and 2014===

In 2010, Schiff defeated Tea Party backed Republican John Colbert for a 6th term.<ref>[http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16512974] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313184506/http://www.pasadenastarnews.com/news/ci_16512974 |date=March 13, 2012 }}</ref> In 2012, he defeated Republican Phil Jennerjahn.<ref>http://articles.glendalenewspress.com/2012-11-07/news/tn-gnp-1107-gatto-liu-schiff-handily-hold-on-to-their-seats_1_phil-jennerjahn-schiff-carol-liu</ref> In 2014, he defeated independent candidate Steve Stokes.
