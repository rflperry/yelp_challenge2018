==Early life, education, and early career==
John David Dingell Jr. was born on July 8, 1926, in [[Colorado Springs, Colorado]], the son of Grace (née Bigler) and [[John D. Dingell Sr.]] (1894–1955), who represented Michigan's 15th district from 1933 to 1955. His father was of [[Austria]]n and [[Poland|Polish]] descent and his mother had [[Swiss Americans|Swiss]] and [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/dingell.htm |title= John Dingell |publisher= Rootsweb |date= |accessdate= April 22, 2013}}</ref> The Dingells were in Colorado in search of a cure for Dingell Sr.'s tuberculosis. (See [[Tuberculosis treatment in Colorado Springs]]). The Dingell surname had been Dzieglewicz, and was "Americanized" by John Dingell Sr's father.<ref>{{cite news |first= David |last= Rosenbaum |work= The New York Times |url= http://www.nytimes.com/1991/09/30/us/washington-at-work-michigan-democrat-presides-as-capital-s-grand-inquisitor.html |title= Washington at Work: Michigan Democrat Presides as Capital's Grand Inquisitor |date= September 30, 1991}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |first= Robert |last= Draper |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=tRPu1v4ofL8C&pg=PA172 |title= Do Not Ask What Good We Do: Inside the U.S. House of Representatives |year= 2012 |page= 172}}</ref>  Dingell Sr. capitalized on the change in his first campaign for office with the slogan "Ring (in) with Dingell."

In [[Washington, D.C.]], John Jr. attended [[Georgetown Preparatory School]] and then the [[United States House of Representatives Page|House Page School]] when he served as a page for the U.S. House of Representatives from 1938 to 1943. He was on the floor of the House when President Roosevelt gave his famous speech after the bombing of Pearl Harbor. In 1944, at the age of 18, Dingell joined the [[United States Army]]. He rose to the rank of Second Lieutenant and received orders to take part in the first wave of [[Operation Downfall|a planned invasion of Japan]] in November 1945; the Congressman has said President Truman's decision to [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|use the atomic bomb to end the war]] saved his life.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.house.gov/dingell/bio.htm |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080201160204/http://www.house.gov/dingell/bio.htm |title= Biography |publisher= Office of John D. Dingell |archive-date= February 1, 2008}}</ref>

He then attended [[Georgetown University]] in Washington, D.C., where he graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree in chemistry in 1949 and a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1952.<ref>{{cite news |publisher= [[CNN]] |url= http://edition.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/08/06/primary.races/index.html |title= Primary Voters Head to Polls in Midwest: Michigan's Dingell Faces Strong Challenge |date= August 6, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |work= Roll Call |url= http://www.rollcall.com/members/255.html |title= Member profile, John Dingell |accessdate=December 27, 2012}}</ref> He was a lawyer in private practice, a research assistant to U.S. Circuit Court judge [[Theodore Levin]], a Congressional employee, a forest ranger, and assistant prosecuting attorney for [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]] until 1955.

In [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|2010]] when the Republicans re-took control of the House of Representatives, Dingell received 57% of the vote.{{citation needed |date=November 2014}}<!--You can't cite another Wikipedia article in a Wikipedia article.--> Between them, he and his father represented the southeastern Michigan area for 80 years.<ref>{{cite news |first= Jennifer |last= Bendery |date= February 24, 2014  |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/02/24/john-dingell-retiring_n_4759374.html |title= John Dingell Retiring After Nearly 60 Years In Congress |work= The Huffington Post |accessdate= November 24, 2014}}</ref>

His district was numbered as the 15th District from 1955 to 1965, when [[redistricting]] merged it into the [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]]-based 16th District; in the primary that year, he defeated 16th District incumbent [[John Lesinski Jr.]]

In 2002, redistricting merged Dingell's 16th District with the [[Washtenaw County, Michigan|Washtenaw County]] and western [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]]-based 13th District, represented by fellow Democratic Representative [[Lynn Rivers]], whom Dingell also bested in the Democratic primary.<ref name=Barone_2002>{{cite news  |title= The Victory of an Old-Fashioned Social Democrat |accessdate= March 3, 2014  |date= August 9, 2002 |authorlink= Michael Barone (pundit) |first= Michael |last= Barone |newspaper= [[U.S. News & World Report]] |archive-date= October 20, 2012 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20121020094742/http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneweb/mb_020809.htm |url= http://www.usnews.com/usnews/opinion/baroneweb/mb_020809.htm}}</ref> The 15th District for the [[109th Congress]] included Wayne County suburbs generally southwest of Detroit, the [[Ann Arbor, Michigan|Ann Arbor]] and [[Ypsilanti, Michigan|Ypsilanti]] areas in Washtenaw County, and all of Monroe County.

Dingell has always won re-election by double-digit margins, although the increasing conservatism of the white suburbs of Detroit since the 1970s led to several serious [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] challenges in the 1990s. With the retirement of [[Jamie L. Whitten]], the death of [[William Huston Natcher|William Natcher]], and the defeat of Texas Representative [[Jack Brooks (American politician)|Jack Brooks]] at the start of a new Congress in January 1995, he became the [[Dean of the United States House of Representatives]]. (Fellow Representative [[Sidney R.

[[File:Congressman John Dingell 2011 Ypsilanti Independence Day Parade.JPG|thumb|right|Congressman Dingell and wife Debbie at the 2011 Ypsilanti Independence Day Parade]]

Dingell was generally classified as a moderately liberal member of the Democratic Party<ref name="ontheissues.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/MI/John_Dingell.htm|title=John Dingell overview|publisher=Ontheissues.org|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}</ref> and throughout his career he was a leading Congressional supporter of [[organized labor]], [[social welfare]] measures and traditional [[Progressivism|progressive]] policies. At the beginning of every Congress, Dingell introduced a bill providing for a [[national health insurance]] system, the same bill that his father proposed while he was in Congress. Dingell also strongly supported [[Bill Clinton]]'s managed-care proposal early in his administration.<ref name="ontheissues.org"/>

On some issues, though, he reflected the Democratic values of his largely Catholic and working-class district. He supported the [[Vietnam War]] until 1971.<ref>{{cite web |first= Ryan J. |last= Stanton |date= June 3, 2013 |url= http://www.annarbor.com/news/john-dingell-going-on-colbert-report-tonight-to-talk-about-becoming-longest-serving-congressman-in-h/ |title= John Dingell to Talk about Becoming Longest-Serving Congressman in Cistory on 'Colbert Report' |work= [[AnnArbor.com]] |accessdate= November 24, 2014 }}</ref> He supported all the [[civil rights]] bills, but opposed expanding school desegregation to Detroit suburbs via [[forced busing|mandatory busing]].<ref>see [http://electionsmeter.com/detail/John-Dingell-id7011 "Biography John Dingell" in ''Elections Meter'']</ref> He took a fairly moderate position on [[abortion]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/MI/John_Dingell_Abortion.htm|title=John Dingell on Abortion|publisher=Ontheissues.org|accessdate=November 25, 2014}}</ref> He worked to balance clean air legislation with the need to protect manufacturing jobs.<ref>{{cite news |first=  Ari |last= Phillips |date= February 24, 2014 |url= http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2014/02/24/3322341/john-dingell-retiring/ |title= John Dingell, Retiring from Congress, Fought for Environmental Causes since before Carbon Was Measured |publisher= Think Progress}}</ref>

[[Michael Barone (pundit)|Michael Barone]] wrote of Dingell in 2002:

{{cquote|There is something grand about the range of Dingell's experience and about his adherence to his philosophy over a very long career. He is an old-fashioned [[social Democrat]] who knows that most voters don't agree with his goals of a single-payer national health insurance plan but presses forward toward that goal as far as he can." 'It's hard to believe that there was once no [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]', he says. 'The Dingell family helped change that. My father worked on Social Security and for national health insurance, and I sat in the chair and presided over the House as Medicare passed (in 1965). I went with Lyndon Johnson for the signing of Medicare at the [[Harry S. Truman]] Library, and I have successfully fought efforts to privatize Social Security and Medicare'. Whether you agree or disagree, the social Democratic tradition is one of the great traditions in our history, and John Dingell has fought for it for a very long time.<ref name=Barone_2002/> }}

On December 15, 2005, on the floor of the House, Dingell read a poem sharply critical of, among other things, [[Fox News]], [[Bill O'Reilly (commentator)|Bill O'Reilly]] and the so-called "[[Christmas controversy|War on Christmas]]".<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getpage.cgi?dbname=2005_record&page=H11598&position=all |title=Retrieve Pages |publisher=Frwebgate.access.gpo.gov |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

Along with [[John Conyers]], in April 2006, Dingell brought an action against [[George W. Bush]] and others alleging violations of the [[United States Constitution|Constitution]] in the passing of the [[Deficit Reduction Act of 2005]]. The case (''[[Conyers v. Bush]]'') was ultimately dismissed for lack of [[standing (law)|standing]].<ref>[http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2633701 ABC News] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203215630/http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=2633701 |date=February 3, 2009 }}</ref>

After winning re-election in 2008 for his 28th consecutive term, Dingell surpassed Whitten's record for having the longest tenure in the House on February 11, 2009.<ref>{{cite news |first= Todd |last= Spangler |url= http://www.freep.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080326/NEWS06/80326053 |title= Dingell Goes for Record by Running for 28th Term |work= Detroit Free Press |date= March 26, 2008}}</ref> In honor of the record, Michigan Governor [[Jennifer Granholm]] declared February 11, 2009, to be John Dingell Day.

As of June 9, 2013, Dingell had served with 2,445 different U.S. Representatives in his career.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://editions.lib.umn.edu/smartpolitics/2013/06/09/2445-us-representatives-who-se/ |title= 2,445 US Representatives Who Served with John Dingell |work=Smart Politics |first=Eric |last=Ostermeier |date= June 9, 2013}}</ref>

====Energy and Commerce chairman====

During his first stint as chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee, Dingell was regarded by analysts as one of the four or five most powerful members of the House.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Dingell is well known for his approach to Congressional oversight of the executive branch.<ref>{{cite news |first= Henry I. |last= Miller |title= Dingell's Grand Inquisitor Politics |work= The Wall Street Journal |date= November 25, 2008}}{{full citation needed|date= November 2014}}</ref> He has subpoenaed numerous government officials to testify before the committee and grilled them for hours. Insisting that all who testify before his committee do so under oath, thus exposing them to [[perjury]] charges if they did not tell the truth, he and his committee have uncovered numerous instances of corruption and waste, such as the use of $600 toilet seats at [[the Pentagon]]. He also claims that the committee's work led to resignations of many [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] officials, and uncovered information that led to legal proceedings that sent many [[Food and Drug Administration]] officials to jail.<ref name="Newsweek">{{cite web|url= http://www.josephcphillips.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=2&t=18276 |title=Let's Talk: What Would Victorious Democrats Do? |publisher=Josephcphillips.com |date=October 22, 2006 |accessdate=April 22, 2013}}{{self-published source|date=November 2014}}{{dead link|date= November 2014}}</ref>

After serving as the committee's ranking Democratic member for 12 years, Dingell regained the chairmanship in 2007. According to ''[[Newsweek]]'', he had wanted to investigate the [[George W. Bush]] Administration's handling of port security, the Medicare prescription drug program and [[Dick Cheney]]'s energy task force.<ref name="Newsweek"/> [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] magazine has stated that he had intended to oversee legislation that addresses [[global warming]] and [[climate change]] caused by carbon emissions from automobiles, energy companies and industry.<ref name=VonDrehle>{{cite journal |first= David |last= Von Drehle |date=June 11, 2007 |title= An Auto Insider Takes on Climate Change |journal= Time  |volume= 169 |issue= 24 |pages= |url= http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1627016,00.html |accessdate= November 24, 2014 |subscription= yes}}</ref>

Dingell lost the chairmanship for the [[111th Congress]] to Congressman [[Henry Waxman]] of California in a [[Democratic Caucus of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic caucus]] meeting on November 20, 2008. Waxman mounted a challenge against Dingell on grounds that Dingell was stalling certain environmental legislation, which would have tightened [[vehicle emissions standards]]—something that could be detrimental to the [[Big Three automobile manufacturers]] that constitute a major source of employment in Dingell's district. Dingell was given the title of Chairman Emeritus in a token of appreciation of his years of service on the committee, and a portrait of him is in the House collection.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://history.house.gov/Collection/Detail/29097?ret=True |title= John David Dingell, Jr. |publisher= U.S. House of Representatives |work= History, Arts & Archives |accessdate= November 24, 2014}}</ref>

====Baltimore case====
In the 1980s, Dingell led a series of Congressional hearings to pursue alleged scientific fraud by [[Thereza Imanishi-Kari]] and Nobel Prize-winner [[David Baltimore]]. The NIH's fraud unit, then called the [[Office of Scientific Integrity]], charged Imanishi-Kari in 1991 of falsifying data and recommended that she be barred from receiving research grants for 10 years. Later, a newly constituted HHS appeals panel of political appointees dismissed the charges against Imanishi-Kari. The findings and negative publicity surrounding them forced David Baltimore to resign as president of [[Rockefeller University]] and caused Imanishi-Kari to lose a tenure-track position. The story of the case is described in Daniel Kevles' 1998 book ''The Baltimore Case'',<ref>''The Baltimore Case''. ISBN 0-393-04103-4.</ref> in a chapter of Horace Freeland Judson's 2004 book ''[[The Great Betrayal: Fraud In Science]]'',<ref>{{cite book |first= Horace Freeland |last= Judson |title= The Great Betrayal: Fraud in Science |year= 2004}}{{full citation needed|date= November 2014}}</ref> and in a 1993 study by [[Serge Lang]], updated and reprinted in his book ''Challenges'' (New York: Springer-Verlag; 1997).

====Robert Gallo and the controversy on who discovered the AIDS virus====

From 1991 to 1995 Dingell's staff investigated claims that [[Robert Gallo]] had used samples supplied to him by [[Luc Montagnier]] to fraudulently claim to have discovered the [[AIDS virus]]. The report concluded that Gallo had engaged in fraud and that the NIH covered up his misappropriation of work by the French team at the [[Institut Pasteur]]. The report contended that:

{{cquote|The real inventors of the HIV blood test were the (Pasteur) scientists. Even more important, the CDC data, together with the extensive data already accumulated by the (Pasteur) scientists, showed that the (Pasteur) virus—discovered long before the putative LTCB virus—was the cause of AIDS.}}

The report was never formally published as a subcommittee report because of the 1995 change in control of the House from Democratic to Republican.<ref>[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/health/chi-100608-hiv-discovery-nobel-prizeoct07,0,2392970.story Baltimore Sun] {{dead link|date=December 2013}}</ref> Other accusations against Gallo were dropped, and while Montagnier's group is considered to be the first to isolate the virus, Gallo's has been recognized as first to prove that this virus was the cause of AIDS.<ref>{{cite journal |last= Prusiner |first= SB |title=Historical Essay: Discovering the Cause of AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 298 |issue= 5599 |page= 1726 |date=November 2002 |pmid= 12459574 |doi= 10.1126/science.1079874}}</ref>

In July 2007, Dingell indicated he planned to introduce a new tax on carbon usage in order to curtail greenhouse gas emissions. The policy has been criticized by some, as polling numbers show voters may be unwilling to pay for the changes. A ''Wall Street Journal'' editorial claimed that vehicle emissions standards that he supports will not yield any substantial greenhouse gas emissions savings.<ref>{{cite news |url= http://online.wsj.com/article/SB118403408397861751.html?mod=opinion_main_review_and_outlooks |work= The Wall Street Journal | title= Truth in Global Warming |date= July 10, 2007}}</ref>
