===Elections===
;1992–2008
After the 1990 census, the Florida legislature carved out a new Third Congressional District in the northern part of the state. This district was designed to enclose an African-American majority within its boundaries. A horseshoe-shaped district touching on largely [[African-American neighborhood]]s in [[Jacksonville, Florida|Jacksonville]], [[Gainesville, Florida|Gainesville]], [[Orlando, Florida|Orlando]], and [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]],<ref name="lyonscheck">Bill Adair and Monica Davey [http://www.sptimes.com/State/72898/Rep_Brown_explains_ch.html "Rep.

Brown faced several candidates in the 1992 Democratic primary, but the strongest opponent to emerge was Andy Johnson, a white talk radio host from Jacksonville. Brown defeated Johnson in the primary and in a two-candidate runoff, and went on to win the general election in November 1992.<ref name="stanford">[http://www.gsb.stanford.edu/news/research/pubpolicy_minorityvoters.shtml "Concentrating Minority Voters Builds Liberal Strength in the South"], Stanford University Graduate School of Business News, April 11, 2004</ref>

In 1995, the boundaries of the Third District were struck down by the [[United States Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] due to their irregular shape.<ref name="redistrict">[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1365/is_n3_v27/ai_18727219 "The shape of things to come: Cleo Fields is the first to fall as redistricting changes the political map — Blacks in Congress are threatened — Elections '96"], Black Enterprise, Oct 1996.</ref> One of the main instigators of the lawsuit that led to the redistricting was Brown's old political rival, Andy Johnson. Brown railed against the change, complaining that "[t]he Bubba I beat [Johnson] couldn't win at the ballot box [so] he took it to court," as she was quoted as saying in the ''New Republic''. Although the district lines were redrawn, Brown still won the 1996 election.<ref name="senatetestimony">{{cite web|url=http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1955&wit_id=5462 |title="Testimony of Professor David Canon" |accessdate=2006-07-28 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060728010340/http://judiciary.senate.gov/testimony.cfm?id=1955&wit_id=5462 |archivedate=July 28, 2006 |df=mdy }} (June 21, 2006).

;2016
In 2015, District 5 was substantially redrawn following a court ruling striking it down as a gerrymander in violation of Florida's Fair Districts Amendment. Brown challenged the new court-ordered map in federal court, arguing that the new plan violated the federal Voting Rights Act. In April 2016, the court ruled against Brown.<ref name="Sunshine State News">{{cite web|url=http://www.tallahassee.com/story/news/politics/2016/04/18/court-rejects-bid-throw-out-florida-congressional-map/83209764/|title=Court rejects bid to throw out Florida congressional map|last=Cotterell|first=Bill|date=April 18, 2016|work=[[Tallahassee Democrat]]|accessdate=May 9, 2016}}</ref>  The new 5th is significantly more compact than its predecessor; it runs in an east-west orientation along the [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] border from downtown Jacksonville to [[Tallahassee]].

===Tenure===
Brown was one of the 31 representatives who voted against counting the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004]].<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml Final vote results for roll call 7], January 6, 2005</ref> In 2006, she voted "no" on the Child Custody Protection Act, Public Expression of Religion Act, [[Electronic Surveillance Modernization Act]], [[Military Commissions Act of 2006|Military Commissions Act]], and Private Property Rights Implementation Act of 2006. She voted "yes" on the [[SAFE Port Act]].<ref name=washpoproject /> On September 29, 2008, Brown voted for the [[Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008]].<ref name="Bailout Roll Call">[http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2008/images/09/29/bailout.rollcall.0929.pdf Bailout roll call], September 29, 2008, retrieved on September 29, 2008</ref><ref>[http://www.themiddleclass.org/legislator/corrine-brown-43?gclid=CLSPofu6sp0CFSXyDAodPkLIjw What has Corrine Brown done for the middle class], accessed October 10, 2009</ref>

On her 2004 political courage test at www.votesmart.org, Corrine stated that she supports decriminalization of marijuana (moving from schedule 1 to presumably a lower schedule). This means if someone is caught with small personal amounts it would presumably be a fine instead of an arrest. She supports increasing funding for drug treatment programs; rather than building more prisons. If a doctor says that a patient can benefit from marijuana, she supports we listen to the doctor rather than listening to the police.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=26797 |title=Project Vote Smart – Representative Corrine Brown – Issue Positions (Political Courage Test) |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=August 23, 2010}}</ref>

Brown has received some of her strongest support from religious leaders, organized labor and the sugar industry.<ref name="lyonscheck"/><ref name="lyonscheck2">Monica Davey, David Barstow and David Dahl [http://www.sptimes.com/State/41498/Lawmaker_got_10_000_f.html "Lawmaker got $10,000 from Lyons fund"] St. Petersburg Times, April 14, 1998</ref><ref>[http://www.congress.org/congressorg/bio/fec/?id=164&cycle=2007-2008 Corrine Brown PAC contributions 2007-8], Congress.org</ref>

Key votes that Brown has made recently include HB 822 National Right To Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011 on November 16, 2011, which she voted against,<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll852.xml Final Vote Results For Roll Call 852]; November 16, 2011</ref> HR 358, Prohibiting Taxpayer Funding for Abortion, which she voted against, and HJ Res 68 Authorizing Limited Use of U.S. Armed Forces in Libya, which she was in favor.

In 2003–2005, Brown cosponsored legislation regarding [[civil rights]] and [[Foreign policy|foreign relations]]. She also participated in [[Michael Moore]]'s "Slacker" college voter drive tour.

====Interest group ratings====
In terms of interest group ratings, Brown holds high percentages in pro-choice groups such as the Florida Alliance of Planned Parenthood Affiliates – Positions on Reproductive Rights  (for which she has a 100% rating), NARAL Pro-Choice America – Positions (100% ), National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association – House of Representatives Score (100% ). Brown overall holds high percentage rates from other issue groups involving animal and wildlife issues, senior and security issues, labor, education, and welfare and poverty. Meanwhile, Brown's ratings are lower in issues that deal with agriculture and economics such as National Taxpayers Union – Positions on Tax and Spending (5%), American Farm Bureau Federation – Positions (33%), and United States Chamber of Commerce – Positions (13%). Other relatively low rates for Brown from interest groups include trade, conservative issues, national security, indigenous peoples issues, gun issues, immigration, and foreign aid and policy issues. The ratings don't necessary correlate with Brown's positions or votes on certain issues during her time as a representative in the House.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.vote-smart.org/candidate/evaluations/26797/corrine-brown |title=Corrine Brown's Ratings and Endorsements – The Voter's Self Defense System – Vote Smart |work=Project Vote Smart |accessdate=September 19, 2015 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

===Political controversies===

;National Baptist Convention check
In 1998, Brown was questioned by the House Ethics Committee about receiving a $10,000 check from [[National Baptist Convention, USA, Inc.|National Baptist Convention]] leader, and long-time associate, [[Henry Lyons]].<ref name="lyonscheck"/> Brown confirmed receiving the check and denied she had used the money improperly.<ref name="lyonscheck"/> Brown said that she had taken the check and converted it into another check made out to Pameron Bus Tours to pay for transportation to a rally she organized in [[Tallahassee]]. She said that she didn't have to report the money, and that she had been cleared, explaining the rally was to protest the reorganization of her district lines, and she did not use it for herself.<ref name="lyonscheck"/>

;Forgery
The Federal Election Commission admonished Brown and Brown's former campaign treasurer quit after he discovered that his name had been forged on her campaign reports. The staffer alleged to have forged the treasurer's signature stayed with Brown and as of 1998 was her chief of staff.<ref name="lyonscheck2"/>

;Congressional Accountability Project
On June 9, 1998, the ''Congressional Accountability Project'' voted to conduct a formal inquiry regarding Brown. The Project called for the [[U.S. House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct]] to determine if Brown had violated House Rule 10.<ref>[http://www.congressproject.org/ethics/corbrowncom.html Ethics complaint]. Congressproject.org.</ref> One of the complaints was that Brown's adult daughter, Shantrel Brown, had received a luxury automobile as a gift from an agent of a [[Gambia]]n millionaire named Foutanga Sissoko. Sissoko, a friend of Congresswoman Brown, had been imprisoned in Miami after pleading guilty to charges of bribing a customs officer. Brown had worked to secure his release, pressuring U.S. Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] to deport Sissoko back to his homeland as an alternative to continued incarceration. The Project held this violated the House gift rule, but Brown denied she had acted improperly. The congressional subcommittee investigating Brown found insufficient evidence to issue a Statement of Alleged Violation, but said she had acted with poor judgment in connection with Sissoko.<ref name="lyonscheck"/><ref>[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&q=cache:MmW84qdNr_AJ:ethics.house.gov/Media/PDF/Press%2520StatementCorrineBrownend.pdf+%2B%22corrine+brown%22+site:ethics.house.gov&hl=en&gl=us&pid=bl&srcid=ADGEESi8Gz_RHqEEBRCmDnQ5fWh7ol0GUtiI0M4GlTMfegkAUaKpXRN23BmGmHo8UsQ77voYt5T09hb8USWMy-TgU6MR91_iNQQfygBucYM9edWmO-TAtmKStM4ErAB2lgRxiqFZsrVd&sig=AHIEtbQLcJIgDY6hV5Z_JbvP0w4HhPmL8w Ethics Report Press Release]; House.Ethics.Gov; September 21, 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.house.gov/ethics/Press_Statement_CorrineBrownend.html "Statement of the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct  in the Matter of Representative Corrine Brown"] (September 21, 2000).

;2000 election
In July 2004 Brown was rebuked by the House of Representatives after she referred to the [[United States presidential election in Florida, 2000|disputed 2000 presidential election]] in Florida as a "coup d'état". This comment came during floor debate over HR-4818, which would have provided for international monitoring of the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]].<ref>David Decamp [http://jacksonville.com/tu-online/stories/071604/met_16113272.shtml], ''The Florida Times-Union'', July 16, 2004</ref>

;Felony fraud indictment
In July 2016, Corinne Brown and her chief of staff, Elias "Ronnie" Simmons, pleaded not guilty to a 24 count federal indictment in relation to a non-profit charity, One Door for Education Foundation Inc. The indictment included charges of participating in a conspiracy to commit mail and wire fraud, multiple counts of mail and wire fraud, concealing material facts on required financial disclosure forms, theft of government property, obstruction of the due administration of the internal revenue laws, and filing false tax returns.<ref name="CNN1">{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/08/politics/rep-corrine-brown-indicted-for-alleged-role-regarding-fraudulent-education-charity/index.html|title=Rep.

The indictment says that Brown and Simmons "filled the coffers of Brown and her associates" with One Door donations for their personal and professional benefit, totaling $800,000, much of which was deposited in cash to Brown's personal bank accounts. Corrine and her associate plead not guilty and were released on a $50,000 bond.  After the hearing, Corrine predicted that she would be cleared at trial. In accordance with House of Representatives rules, Brown stated she was temporarily stepping down as a ranking member of the House Committee on Veteran's Affairs.<ref name="Bloom1">http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2016-07-08/urgent-us-rep-corrine-brown-indicted-after-fraud-investigation</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/us-rep-corrine-brown-indicted-fraud-investigation-40436088|title=US Rep.

===Campaign finances===
During her 2009–2010 campaign, Corrine Brown raised up to $966,669 from fundraising. Brown’s top contributors included CSX Corporation, a railroad-based freight transportation company with its headquarters in Jacksonville, FL; Carnival Corp., cruise line operator; Picerne Real Estate Group; Union Pacific Corp and Berkshire Hathaway, which owns BNSF Railway. Brown’s top industry contributors included those railroads, lawyers/farm firms, real estate, transportation unions, and sea transportation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/summary.php?cid=N00002713&cycle=2010|title=Rep.

During her campaigning, the largest source of funds was given by large individual companies, which accounted for 54% of the contributions, and PAC contributions, which accounted for 36%. Sources of funds also included small individual contributions, self-financing on Brown's part and other sources.
