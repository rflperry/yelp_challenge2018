===Elections===
;1990
Stockman's first run for Congress was in March 1990 in [[Texas's 9th congressional district]].

In 1995, Stockman wrote an article for ''[[Guns & Ammo]]'' claiming that the [[Waco siege]] had been orchestrated by the Clinton administration in order "to prove the need for a ban on so-called 'assault weapons.'"<ref>{{cite news|title=Whatever Happened to the Class of 1994?: The right-wing firebrands who charged into Congress in 1994 launched the missile that impeached Bill Clinton.

In 1995, Stockman called for a Congressional investigation into [[Alfred Kinsey]]'s 1948 study ''[[Sexual Behavior in the Human Male]]'' after learning that Kinsey had used data from the diary of a pedophile.<ref>{{cite news|last=Fisher|first=Marc|title=Critics: Sex Ed A Sham Since Kinsey Used Pedophile's Data|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=19951212&slug=2157358|accessdate=1 February 2014|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=12 December 1995}}</ref> Stockman believed that the allegations discredited current theories of [[sexual education]] in the United States, writing to his congressional colleagues that"[o]ur children have been taught that . . . any type of sex is a valid outlet for their emotions.

==Inter-congressional career (1997–2013)==
In 1998, Stockman ran unsuccessfully in the Republican primary for the [[Texas Railroad Commission]].<ref name=nr1/>

Between 2005 and 2007, Stockman worked with the conservative [[Leadership Institute]]<ref name=nr1/> as director of its [[Campus Leadership Program]].<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/texas-36th-house-district-20121101 Texas, 36th House District] ''[[National Journal]]''.

In 2006, he attempted to run as an [[Independent (politics)|Independent]] candidate for [[Texas's 22nd congressional district]], [[Tom DeLay]]'s former seat, and even though he had enough signatures to qualify for ballot access, the Texas Secretary of State invalidated enough signatures to make him ineligible.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/politics/3994768.html |title=Stockman fails to get enough names – Houston Chronicle |publisher=Chron.com |date=2006-06-23 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1654153/posts |title=Texas Secretary Of State Rules Stockman Can't Run For Congress - Fort Bend Now |publisher=Fortbendnow.com |date=2006-06-22 |accessdate=2016-06-27}}</ref> Stockman registered for the special election to fill out the remainder of DeLay's term; he was one of five candidates.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.sos.state.tx.us/elections/forms/candidates/2006con.pdf | title=Races with Candidates with Addresses Report | publisher=Texas Secretary of State | accessdate=2006-09-01|format=PDF}}</ref> He finished third, with 10.75% of the vote.

During his time away from Congress, Stockman also cared for his father, who had [[Alzheimer's disease]]. The cost of caring for him drove Stockman to declare [[bankruptcy]]<ref>''In re Stephen E. Stockman and Patti F. Stockman'', case no. 02-33843-H3-7, U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas (Houston Div.); petition filed April 5, 2002; discharge granted Oct. 24, 2002; case closed Oct. 24, 2002.</ref> and, when his father's disease became too severe, Stockman moved him to a veteran's home. When his father died, Stockman decided to run for Congress in the 2012 elections.<ref name=nr1/>

==U.S. House of Representatives (2013–2015)==

===Election===
In 2011 Stockman formed an [[exploratory committee]], Friends of Steve Stockman, to consider a run for the [[Texas's 14th congressional district|14th district]] seat being vacated by unsuccessful presidential candidate [[Ron Paul]]. Stockman instead ran in 2012 in the newly created 36th District.  This includes the Harris County portion of Friendswood, where Stockman's home was located.  It was drawn to be heavily Republican, and it was understood that whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's first congressman. In the May 29 primary, Stockman finished second in the first round, behind Stephen Vincent Takach, a financial planner. Takach finished with 22 percent of the vote, far short of the 50 percent threshold required to win.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm|title=Republican primary election returns, May 29, 2012|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=May 30, 2012}}</ref> Stockman defeated Takach in the July 31 runoff 55%–45%, all but assuring his return to Congress after a 16-year absence.<ref name=nyt>{{cite web|url=http://elections.nytimes.com/2012/primaries/congress/texas|title=Texas Congressional Primaries – Election Results|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|date=March 7, 2013|accessdate=August 2, 2012}}</ref>

In the November [[general election]], Stockman defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] Max Owen Martin, a retired pilot from [[Clear Lake City, Texas]], with 71% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov06_164_state.htm?x=0&y=8111&id=401|title=Texas general election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=Texas Secretary of State|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>

In January 2013, Stockman introduced "The Safe Schools Act," a bill that would repeal federal laws mandating "[[Gun-free zone|gun free zones]]" around schools in the wake of the [[Sandy Hook Elementary School shooting]] which took place in the previous month. He said "I have one concern, protecting children from dangerous predators. By disarming qualified citizens and officials in schools we have created a dangerous situation for our children. In the 22 years before enactment of ‘gun free school zones’ there were two mass school shootings. In the 22 years since enactment of ‘gun free schools’ there have been 10 mass school shootings.

In February 2013, Stockman voted against the re-authorization of the [[Violence Against Women Act]], objecting to provisions in the bill that expanded protections for transgender victims of domestic violence. Stockman said, "This is helping the liberals, this is horrible. Unbelievable. What really bothers—it's called a women's act, but then they have men dressed up as women, they count that.

On April 25, 2014, Stockman stated that the Ethics Committee of the U.S. House of Representatives was investigating a campaign finance reporting error made by a former campaign worker.

==Political positions==

===Energy independence===
Stockman supports American energy independence and used his position on the technology committee to question the EPA's technological criteria for evaluating applications on hydraulic fracking.<ref name="stockman.house.gov">{{cite web|url=http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/blog-posts/science-committee-questions-scientific-integrity-of-epa-hydraulic-fracturing |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140201094805/http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/blog-posts/science-committee-questions-scientific-integrity-of-epa-hydraulic-fracturing |archivedate=February 1, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> He has worked on improving the current technologies being used<ref name="stockman.house.gov"/> on shale oil and gas production. He was a member of the carbon caucus, supports the keystone pipeline, use of coal, opening up federal lands for drilling as well as hydraulic [[fracking]] for [[shale oil]] and gas production.

===Economy and jobs===
Stockman has spoken out about the need to dredge and secure the Texas Ports like Houston, Cedar Bayou, Beaumont and Orange from which many of the Gulf Coast petrochemicals are shipped, providing a considerable number of jobs, as these ports are important to the Texan economy.<ref name="viewer.zmags.com">{{cite web|url=http://viewer.zmags.com/publication/3dcf1362#/3dcf1362/28|title=Platts Horizon Spring 2013|work=zmags.com|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> The district includes Baytown, Pasadena, Deer Park, Mount Bellvieu and is the largest petrochemical industrial district in the United States.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/TX/36|title=Texas’s 36th Congressional District - TX-36 Representatives & District Map - GovTrack.us|work=govtrack.us|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> With the advent of production of shale gas, over 100 billion dollars are expected to be invested in the U.S. petrochemical sector over the next few years (most of it in Texas), and over 40 billion dollars in Stockman’s district, potentially creating numerous new jobs.<ref name="viewer.zmags.com"/> These plants include ethylene crackers, PDH plants, methanol manufacturing facilities and others. Stockman has repeatedly appealed to the EPA to expedite permits for new plant construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stockman-gets-promise-from-epa-to-unclog-texas-jobs-pipeline-offers-to|title=Press release|work=house.gov|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> He has also called on [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]] to obtain a lifting of what he argues is an EPA blockade on American jobs.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stockman-challenges-biden-to-lift-epa-blockade-on-port-jobs|title=Press release|work=house.gov|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref> In a statement, Stockman has said that unless the EPA is reformed by streamlining permits and studies and approving the REINS Act, the United States will cease to be an economic power. The "Regulations from the Executive In Need of Scrutiny," or REINS, Act would require that any proposed federal regulation costing more than $100 million be approved by Congress and signed by the President.

At 3.5 cents per kilowatt hour, Texas industrial facilities enjoy one of the cheapest power costs in the world, which Stockman argues is conducive to investment and job growth and encourages employment. Stockman has favored keeping power costs low.<ref>{{cite web | title=Congress of the United States &#124; (letter) | url=http://science.house.gov/sites/republicans.science.house.gov/files/documents/Letters/121913_mccarthy.pdf | format=PDF | date=December 19, 2013 | publisher=''science.house.gov'' | accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/blog-posts/scalise-anti-carbon-tax-amendment-passed-by-house|title=Press release|work=house.gov|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>

===Views on the Constitution===
Stockman was known for his strong support of [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] Rights. He worked with [[Rand Paul]] and introduced the "Restore The Constitution Act," the House companion to Paul's "Separation of Powers Restoration and Second Amendment Protection Act." Stockman and Paul worked together on the effort.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stockman-introduces-bill-to-stop-obama-s-executive-orders|title=Press release|work=house.gov|accessdate=August 2, 2016}}</ref>

===Fiscal===
Stockman has never voted for a tax increase and has been a proponent for spending cuts and small government.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stockman-will-vote-against-reckless-debt-spending-proposal |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706015618/http://stockman.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/stockman-will-vote-against-reckless-debt-spending-proposal |archivedate=July 6, 2014 |df=mdy }}</ref> He cosponsored 2013 Energy Freedom Prosperity Act that would have eliminated all energy-related tax subsidies.<ref name="viewer.zmags.com" /> He sponsored the bill to defund "Obamacare". Stockman advocates abolishing the [[Internal Revenue Service]] and  replacing the federal income tax with a [[flat tax]].{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}
