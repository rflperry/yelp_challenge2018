'''Kevin Owen McCarthy''' (born January 26, 1965) is an American [[Member of Congress|congressman]] from [[Bakersfield, California]]. He serves in the [[United States House of Representatives]] for [[California's 23rd congressional district|California's 23rd district]] and as the [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]].

It became somewhat more compact, losing its share of the [[Central Coast (California)|Central Coast]] while picking up large parts of [[Tulare County, California|Tulare County]]. This district was as heavily Republican as its predecessor, and McCarthy won a fourth term with 73.2% of the vote vs. 26.8% for independent, No Party Preference (NPP) opponent, [[Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf|title=Statement of Vote: November 6, 2012 General Election|work=California Secretary of State|accessdate=June 19, 2014}}</ref>

As a freshman congressman, McCarthy was appointed to the Republican steering committee. Republican leader John Boehner appointed him chairman of the Republican platform committee during the committee's meetings in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota|Minneapolis]] in August 2008, which produced the [http://www.gop.com/2008Platform/ Republican Party Platform for 2008]. He was also one of the three founding members of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee#Young Guns Program|GOP Young Guns Program]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.gopyoungguns.com/about/ |title=Young Guns – About |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date= |website=gopyoungguns.com/ |publisher=National Republican Congressional Committee |accessdate=}}</ref>

After the [[United States presidential election, 2008|2008 elections]], he was chosen as chief deputy minority whip, the highest-ranking appointed position in the House Republican caucus. His predecessor, [[Eric Cantor]], was named minority whip. On November 17, 2010, he was selected by the House Republican caucus to be the [[Majority Whip of the United States House of Representatives|House majority whip]] in the [[112th Congress]]. In this post, he was the third-ranking House Republican, behind [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House speaker]] [[John Boehner]] and [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|majority leader]] [[Eric Cantor]].

Cantor lost the June 2014 primary for his seat in Congress, and announced he would step down from House leadership at the end of July. McCarthy sought to succeed Cantor, and after some speculation that representatives [[Pete Sessions]] and [[Jeb Hensarling]] would challenge him, both dropped out leaving a clear path for McCarthy to become House majority leader.<ref name="RollCall612">{{cite news| url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/petesessions-drops-out-of-majority-leader-race/?dcz=| title=Pete Sessions Drops Out of Majority Leader Race, Clearing Way for Kevin McCarthy| last=Fuller|first=Matt|date=June 12, 2014|work=[[Roll Call]]|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}</ref> On June 13, representative [[Raul Labrador]] announced he would also seek the leadership position.<ref name="ReutersLabrador">{{cite news|url=http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/06/13/us-usa-congress-cantor-labrador-idUSKBN0EO21820140613|title=Republican Rep.

According to the [[University of Minnesota]]'s [[Humphrey School of Public Affairs]], McCarthy is the least-tenured majority leader in the history of the House of Representatives. When he assumed the majority leadership position in July 2014, he had served only seven years, six months and 29 days, the least experience of any floor leader in the House's history by more than a year.<ref>{{cite news |last=Bobic |first=Igor |date=June 20, 2014 |title=Kevin McCarthy Is The Least Tenured House Majority Leader Ever |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/20/kevin-mccarthy-tenured_n_5514788.html |newspaper=The Huffington Post |location=New York |publisher=AOL |accessdate=June 24, 2014}}</ref>

McCarthy kept four of his predecessor's staff members on his staff when he took over as majority leader, including deputy chief of staff Neil Bradley, who now has served in that role for three majority leaders.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Dumain|first1=Emma|title=Majority Leader-Elect McCarthy Inherits Top Cantor Aides|url=http://blogs.rollcall.com/218/kevin-mccarthy-staff-neil-bradley/?dcz=|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=August 4, 2014}}</ref>

==== Comments on House Select Committee on Benghazi ====
In a September 29, 2015, Fox TV interview with [[Sean Hannity]], McCarthy talked about the House of Representatives' special panel investigation into the incident when [[2012 Benghazi attack|Islamic militants attacked the American diplomatic compound in Benghazi in 2012]]. Republicans had long maintained that the only purpose of the government-funded committee was to investigate the deaths of four Americans.<ref>{{cite news |title= Kevin McCarthy And His Benghazi Gaffe Star In Hillary Clinton's New Ad "The Republicans finally admit it." |first= Amanda |last=Terkel |work= The Huffington Post |date= October 5, 2015 |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthy-hillary-clinton-benghazi_5612e53ae4b022a4ce5f1a6a }}</ref>

In the interview, McCarthy said, “Everybody thought Hillary Clinton was unbeatable, right? But we put together a Benghazi special committee, a select committee. What are her numbers today? Her numbers are dropping. Why? Because she’s untrustable.

Many media outlets and Democratic lawmakers interpreted this comment as an admission that the investigation was a partisan political undertaking rather than a substantive inquiry.<ref>{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2015/09/30/kevin-mccarthys-comments-about-benghazi-should-raise-a-red-flag-for-republicans/?postshare=9941443627166312 |title= Kevin McCarthy's comments about Benghazi should trouble Republicans |first= Chris |last= Cillizza |work= The Washington Post |date= September 30, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Dems pile on after McCarthy comments on Hillary Clinton, Benghazi panel |work= The Washington Post |first= Elisa |last= Viebeck |date= September 30, 2015 |accessdate= October 1, 2015 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Democrats' sweet Benghazi revenge: Kevin McCarthy's gaffe is the gift that keeps on giving |work= Salon |first= Simon |last= Maloy |date= October 6, 2015 |url= http://www.salon.com/2015/10/06/democrats_sweet_benghazi_revenge_kevin_mccarthys_gaffe_is_the_gift_that_keeps_on_giving/ }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title= Gowdy slams McCarthy on Benghazi comments: He 'screwed up' |first= Nick |last= Gass |work= Politico |date= October 7, 2015 |url= http://www.politico.com/story/2015/10/trey-gowdy-kevin-mccarthy-wrong-benghazi-hillary-clinton-214498 }}</ref>

Several days later, McCarthy followed up on his comments and said that "Benghazi is not political. It was created for one purpose and one purpose only — to find the truth on behalf of the families of four dead Americans. ... The integrity of [[Trey Gowdy|Chairman Gowdy]], the Committee and the work they've accomplished is beyond reproach. The serious questions Secretary Clinton faces are due entirely to her own decision to put classified information at risk and endanger our national security. ... I've been very clear about this. And don't use politics to try to change this around. I could have been more clear in my description of what was going forward."<ref>{{cite news |title= Kevin McCarthy Admits Benghazi Comment Was A Gaffe: John Boehner said it could have happened to anybody |first= Michael |last= McAuliffS |work= The Huffington Post |date= October 7, 2015 |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/kevin-mccarthy-admits-benghazi-comment-was-a-gaffe_56152b14e4b0cf9984d7c207 }}</ref>
