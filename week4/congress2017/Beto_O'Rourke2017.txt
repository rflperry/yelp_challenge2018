==El Paso City Council (2005-2011)==

===Elections===
In mid-2005, O'Rourke ran for the El Paso City Council, and defeated two-term incumbent City Councilman [[Anthony Cobos]], 57%-43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=765554 |title=El Paso City Council District 8 Race - May 07, 2005 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.elpasotexas.gov/muni_clerk/2005generalelection.asp?print=true |title=2005 General Election |publisher=Elpasotexas.gov |date= |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}</ref>

===Tenure===

====Minutemen====
In August 2005, a resolution was drafted by O'Rourke and fellow council member Steve Ortega, calling on city officials to discourage the anti-illegal immigrant [[Minuteman Project|Minutemen]] from patrolling the local stretch of the Texas-Mexico border and "reject civilian attempts to enforce immigration law." The Minutemen's spokesman [[Shannon McGauley]] said his group planned to go ahead with October operations in El Paso, despite the resolution. <!-- RESULT?? --> {{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====Recall====
In 2006 there was a failed attempt to recall O'Rourke over an El Paso Downtown Redevelopment plan. South Side activist Carmen Felix initiated a recall petition drive against him on May 3, 2006. Despite the threat of recall, O'Rourke continued to strongly advocate the use of [[eminent domain]] in conjunction with the plan to redevelop downtown El Paso. At the El Paso city council meeting held on July 9, 2006, still under threat of recall, he showed a distinct change in tone toward the El Paso Downtown Revitalization Plan. He responded to a question posed by fellow city councilman Lozano as to whether residents displaced by new construction "could come back to the area", responding in assurance that the city would make "every effort" to ensure displaced residents were allowed to remain in their same neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=November 2012}}

====Ethics complaint====
On September 5, 2006, the Land Grab Opponents of El Paso filed an ethics complaint with the City of El Paso, citing the business relationship between O'Rourke and the Paso del Norte Group, developers who had proposed a Downtown Revitalization Plan for El Paso.  O'Rourke's own company, Stanton Street Technology Group, was providing Internet and Information Technology services to Paso del Norte. O'Rourke's father-in-law, William Sanders, was a leader in the Paso del Norte Group. The complaint said "O'Rourke is impermissibly entangled in the Paso del Norte Group's Downtown Revitalization Plan, through both family and business ties".<ref name="LandGrab">{{cite web|url=http://www.landgrabopponents.org/pdfs/CitizenComplaintForm.pdf |title=Land Grab Opponents complaint |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927225026/http://www.landgrabopponents.org/pdfs/CitizenComplaintForm.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 |df=mdy }}</ref> The complaint raised objections to two votes by O'Rourke, one to extend Paso del Norte's contract with the city in 2005 and another to accept the group's redevelopment proposal in March. It alleged that O'Rourke's participation in these votes "violated his fiduciary duty to the citizens of El Paso".<ref name="LandGrab"/> The city's Ethics Review Commission summarily dismissed this complaint on October 12, 2006. The Land Grab Opponents filed a second complaint that suggested that the CFO of Sanders' company, The Verde Group, prepared O'Rourke's income tax return in 2006. This complaint was dismissed on October 18, 2006.

An attorney for the Land Grab Opponents said his the ethics complaints were filed to make O'Rourke recuse himself from debating and voting on the Downtown plan.<ref>[http://elpasotimes.com/search/ci_4449003 "O'Rourke's in-law to invest in plan"], El Paso Times</ref> O'Rourke abstained from voting when the Council considered establishing a Downtown Tax Increment Reinvestment Zone.{{Citation needed|date=April 2013}}

====War on drugs====

In January 2009, O'Rourke sponsored a resolution asking the federal government to rethink the [[War on Drugs]] and initiate an "open and honest debate" about ending the prohibition of illegal drugs. The resolution, which was unanimously supported by his colleagues on the El Paso City Council was vetoed by then-Mayor [[John Cook (Texas politician)|John Cook]], and spurred a larger national discussion on the topic. He told reporters that the reason he decided to speak up about what he called the failed war on drugs was the thousands of people who have been killed in the drug war in the adjoining city of [[Ciudad Juarez|Ciudad Juarez, Chihuahua]], Mexico. "I hope it has all had its intended affect of starting the national discussion of the wisdom of the war on drugs … and probably more importantly, helping to bring about a better solution than the status quo, which has led to the terror and tragedy in Juarez."<ref>[http://newspapertree.com/news/3300-o-rourke-in-national-headlights-over-12-words-in-drug-war-resolution "O'Rourke in national headlights over 12 words in Drug War resolution"], NewspaperTree.com</ref>
