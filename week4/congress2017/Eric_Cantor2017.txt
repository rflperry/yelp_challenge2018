'''Eric Ivan Cantor''' (born June 6, 1963) is an American politician, lawyer, and businessman, who served as the [[United States House of Representatives|United States representative]] for [[Virginia's 7th congressional district]] from 2001 until 2014. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he became [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] when the [[112th United States Congress|112th Congress]] convened on January 3, 2011. He previously served as [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Whip]] from 2009 until 2011.

His district included most of the northern and western sections of [[Richmond, Virginia|Richmond]], along with most of Richmond's western suburbs and, until redistricting in 2013, portions of the [[Shenandoah Valley]]. Cantor was the highest-ranking Jewish member of [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] in its history, and at the time of his resignation, the only non-Christian Republican in either house.<ref name=Cantorelected/><ref>{{cite news|last1=Lachman|first1=Samantha|title=With Eric Cantor Defeat, Congressional Republicans Lose Only Non-Christian|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/06/10/eric-cantor-republicans-religion_n_5482432.html|accessdate=June 11, 2014|work=The Huffington Post|date=June 11, 2014}}</ref>

In June 2014, in his bid for re-election, Cantor lost the Republican primary to economics professor [[Dave Brat]] in an upset that surprised political analysts. In response Cantor announced his early resignation as House Majority Leader, and several weeks later, he announced his resignation from Congress, which took effect August 18, 2014. Immediately thereafter, Cantor accepted a position as vice chairman of investment bank [[Moelis & Company]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ftalphaville.ft.com/2014/09/02/1953191/k-street-to-boutique/|title=K Street to boutique|publisher=|accessdate=September 14, 2014}}</ref>

As House Majority Leader, Cantor was named in House Resolution 368, which was passed by the [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]] on the night of September 30, 2013, the night before the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|October 2013 government shutdown]] began, as the only member of the House with the power to bring forth bills and resolutions for a vote if both chambers of Congress disagree on that bill or resolution. Prior to the resolution's passing in committee, it was within the power of every member of the House under House Rule XXII, Clause 4 to be granted privilege to call for a vote. This amendment to the House rules was blamed for causing the partial government shutdown and for prolonging it since Cantor refused to allow the Senate's continuing resolution to be voted on in the House. Journalists and commentators noted during the shutdown that if the Senate's version of the continuing resolution were to be voted on, it would have passed the House with a majority vote since enough Democrats and Republicans supported it, effectively ending the government shutdown.<ref>{{cite news|title=The House GOP's Little Rule Change That Guaranteed A Shutdown|author=Scott, D.|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/dc/the-house-gop-s-little-rule-change-that-guaranteed-a-shutdown?c=upworthy|newspaper=TPM|date=October 10, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=House Republicans Changed The Rules So A Majority Vote Couldn't Stop The Government Shutdown|author=Alman, A.|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/10/13/house-republicans-rules-change_n_4095129.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=October 13, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=As Democrats seethe over GOP tactics, video over rules change goes viral|author=Eilperin, J.|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2013/10/14/as-democrats-seethe-over-gop-tactics-video-over-rules-change-goes-viral/|newspaper=Washington Post|date=October 14, 2013|accessdate=October 16, 2013}}</ref>

As Majority Leader, Cantor steered the [[STOCK Act]] through the House, which requires Congressmen to disclose their stock investments more regularly and in a more transparent manner.<ref>{{cite web|last=Schroeder |first=Peter |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/1007-other/217659-lawmakers-hit-bipartisan-note-following-stock-act-passage |title=Lawmakers hit bipartisan note following STOCK Act passage – The Hill's On The Money |publisher=Thehill.com |date=March 22, 2012 |accessdate=August 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120327013019/http://thehill.com:80/blogs/on-the-money/1007-other/217659-lawmakers-hit-bipartisan-note-following-stock-act-passage |archivedate=March 27, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref> The legislation passed the House in a 417–2 bipartisan vote on February 9, 2012.

==Threats and campaign office incident==
After the passage of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|health care reform bill]] in March 2010, Cantor reported that somebody had shot a bullet through a window of his campaign office in [[Richmond, Virginia]].
