A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he was the [[U.S. House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MI|14}} from 2013 until his election to the Senate. The district includes the eastern half of [[Detroit]], as well as the [[Grosse Pointes]], [[Hamtramck]], [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]] and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]]. He previously represented {{ushr|MI|9}} from 2009 to 2013.

Prior to his election to Congress, Peters served in the [[United States Navy Reserve]], spent 22 years as an investment advisor, and worked briefly in academia. He was elected to the Rochester Hills City Council in 1991, going on to represent the 14th District in the [[Michigan Senate]] from 1995 to 2002. He was the Democratic nominee for [[Michigan Attorney General]] in 2002, narrowly losing to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Mike Cox (U.S. politician)|Mike Cox]]. He was then appointed Commissioner of the [[Michigan Lottery]] by [[Governor of Michigan|Governor]] [[Jennifer Granholm]], serving from 2003 to 2008, when he resigned to run for Congress.

In 2014 Peters [[United States Senate election in Michigan, 2014|was elected]] to the [[United States Senate]] seat previously held by retiring Democratic Senator [[Carl Levin]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Sen.

==Michigan Senate==

===Elections===
In November 1994, Peters was elected to the [[Michigan Senate]] to represent the [[Oakland County]]-based 14th district. He was re-elected in 1998 and served until 2002, when he was compelled to retire owing to the law on [[term limits]]. Peters was succeeded in the 14th district by [[Gilda Jacobs]].

===Tenure===
The district is one of the most diverse state Senate districts—containing nearly every racial, ethnic and religious group in Michigan. Located in southeastern [[Oakland County, Michigan|Oakland County]], it includes the cities of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]], [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]], [[Southfield, Michigan|Southfield]], and [[Oak Park, Michigan|Oak Park]].

Peters was chosen by his Democratic colleagues to chair his party's caucus. He was also a member of the Michigan Law Revision Commission and served on the Michigan Sentencing Commission.<ref name="MLRC bio"/> Both the [[Michigan State House of Representatives]] and the Senate passed a bill sponsored by Peters which banned any new wells under the state waters of the Great Lakes except in case of a state energy emergency. The bill passed into law without the signature of Governor [[John Engler]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Oakland Press |work=Local News September 1, 2006 |url=http://www.theoaklandpress.com/stories/090106/loc_2006090136.shtml |accessdate=2007-08-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311055248/http://www.theoaklandpress.com/stories/090106/loc_2006090136.shtml |archivedate=March 11, 2007 }}</ref>

==2002 statewide elections==
In his final year as a member of the Michigan Senate, Peters was a candidate for governor and later for [[Michigan Attorney General|Attorney General]]. As the Democratic nominee for attorney general, he lost to Republican [[Mike Cox (U.S. politician)|Mike Cox]]. Peters came within 5,200 votes of Cox—less than a 0.17 percent margin.<ref>{{cite news |title =New York Times|work = National Briefing Michigan: Candidate Won't Seek Recount|url=http://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9D05E0D71F39F935A15752C1A9649C8B63&n=Top%2fReference%2fTimes%20Topics%2fSubjects%2fE%2fElection%20Results| accessdate=2007-08-09 | first=David | last=Enders | date=November 26, 2002}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title =2002 Attorney General Election Results|work = U.S. Election Atlas|url=http://www.uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=26&year=2002&f=0&off=9&elect=0| accessdate=2007-08-09 }}</ref> Peters decided not to contest the election results despite reported irregularities. Several mistakes were reportedly found during analysis, including a precinct in [[Dearborn, Michigan|Dearborn]] which recorded Peters with 96 votes when he actually had 396.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2008#District 9}}
On August 7, 2007, Peters ended months of speculation by formally announcing he would run against eight-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] congressman [[Joe Knollenberg]] in the 9th District, which included almost all of Oakland County.  Peters resigned as state lottery commissioner to devote his full energy to the campaign.

Knollenberg was considered vulnerable due to an increasing Democratic trend in what was once a heavily Republican district.  He was nearly defeated in 2006 by [[Nancy Skinner (Midwestern politician)|Nancy Skinner]], a former radio talk-show host who spent virtually no money, leading the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] to target him for defeat. Knollenberg's opponents in 2002 and 2004 performed significantly below the Democratic base in the 9th District.

In the 2002 state attorney general race, Peters performed at or above the Democratic base in 72 percent of the 9th District precincts. In his 1998 state Senate campaign, he performed at or above base in 99 percent of the precincts.<ref>{{cite web |title =Swing State Project|work =9th District|url=http://www.swingstateproject.com/showDiary.do?diaryId=670|accessdate=2007-08-09 }}</ref>

Peters won the November 4 election by 33,524 votes, taking 52 percent of the vote to Knollenberg's 43 percent. [[Barack Obama]] carried Oakland County by 15 points; roughly two-thirds of Oakland County was in the 9th. He was the fourth person and first Democrat to represent the district since its creation in 1933.<ref>{{cite web|last=Gray|first=Kathleen|title=Democratic wave helps Peters win in 9th District|url=http://www.freep.com/article/20081106/NEWS15/811060398/Democratic-wave-helps-Peters-win-9th-District|work=Detroit Free Press}}</ref>

Peters defeated challenges by Republican [[Andrew Raczkowski|Andrew "Rocky" Raczkowski]], Libertarian Adam Goodman, Independent Bob Gray, Independent Matthew Kuofie, and Green Douglas Campbell.<ref>{{cite web

;2012
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Michigan, 2012#District 14}}
Due to the state's population decline, as reflected by the 2010 Federal Census, Michigan lost one congressional district. As a result of the subsequent redistricting of house seats, much of Peters' 9th district, including his home in Bloomfield Hills, was merged with the [[Michigan's 12th congressional district|12th district]], represented by fellow Democrat [[Sandy Levin]].  The new district retained Peters' district number—the 9th—but geographically was more Levin's district.

In September 2011, Peters opted to run in the newly redrawn 14th District.  The district had previously been the 13th District, represented by freshman Democrat [[Hansen Clarke]].  The redrawn district is based in Detroit, but contains a large chunk of Peters' old State Senate district and portions of his old congressional district.  Indeed, Peters had represented most of the Oakland County portion of the district at one time or another.  Due to Detroit's dwindling population, it was no longer possible to keep the district exclusively within [[Wayne County, Michigan|Wayne County]].  In the August 2012 Democratic primary, he defeated Clarke (who opted to follow most of his constituents into the reconfigured 14th even though his home had been drawn into the reconfigured 13th—the old 14th) and Southfield Mayor [[Brenda Lawrence]].  The 14th is a heavily Democratic, 58 percent black-majority district, and Peters was overwhelmingly favored in November.  As expected, he bested Republican John Hauler in the general election with 82 percent of the vote.  He was the first white congressman to represent a significant portion of Detroit since 1993.

In July 2010, the ''[[Michigan Messenger]]'' wrote that Peters was "criticizing the leadership of his own party.

Peters’ bill makes cuts in the federal energy budget.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Peters criticizes Dem. leadership on spending|url=http://michiganmessenger.com/39931/peters-criticizes-dem-leadership-on-spending|work=The Michigan Messenger|publisher=[[The American Independent News Network]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref> “We have been growing increasingly frustrated with the lack of action and talking about specifics and putting those on the table,” Peters said. “We’ve been frustrated with both Democratic leadership and Republicans.”<ref>{{cite web|first=Simmi|last=Aujla|title=Four House Democrats revolt|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0710/39950.html|publisher=[[Politico]]|accessdate=4 April 2012}}</ref>

Peters allied himself with the [[Occupy Wall Street]] movement, making an appearance at [[Occupy Detroit]] on November 6. Speaking to reporters, he stated: "It's speculation on [[Wall Street]] that we're still paying the price for here, particularly in Detroit that almost brought the auto industry to a collapse because of what we saw on Wall Street.
