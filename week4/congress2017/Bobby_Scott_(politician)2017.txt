The legislation passed the next day, Dec. 8, 2011 by 317&ndash;98. Video: C-SPAN]]

Scott is the first [[African American]] Representative from Virginia since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]].

Scott's congressional district is the only one with a majority black population in [[Virginia]]. The district was created in 1992 and has remained the most Democratic district in Virginia.<ref name="Almanac">The Almanac of American Politics, National Journal Group, 2009.</ref>

In regards to the bill, Lee said that "it is important that we put in place a safety net for those still looking for work. We cannot and will not allow our fellow Americans to fall by the wayside. Congressman Scott and I plan to continue to push for passage of this legislation because it is simply the right thing to do."<ref name="Introduces 99">{{cite news|title=Barbara Lee, Bobby Scott Introduce Bill For 99ers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/20/barbara-lee-bobby-scott-i_n_799097.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=20 December 2010}}</ref>

He went on to serve as the chief surgeon of two Newport News hospitals in the course of which he was mentor to many young doctors. In the [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregated]] South during a time when African-Americans labored under the iniquitous system of [[Jim Crow laws]], Dr. Scott was a tireless advocate of racial, social and educational equality and in 1952 became the first African-American appointed to the Newport News school board in the 20th century.<ref>{{cite news|last1=KNEMEYER|first1=Nelda|title=C.

Had the Clinton-Kaine ticket won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|general election]], Kaine would have resigned his Senate seat, and Democratic [[Governor of Virginia]] [[Terry McAuliffe]] would have been able to appoint a replacement to serve until a 2017 [[by-election|special election]].  In August 2016, former Democratic governor [[Douglas Wilder]] stated that he would want McAuliffe to appoint Scott to the seat, stating that it "would be good for the commonwealth, good for the Democratic Party, of which Bobby has been most supportive, and great for our nation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Vozzella|first=Laura|title=Douglas Wilder wants Rep.
