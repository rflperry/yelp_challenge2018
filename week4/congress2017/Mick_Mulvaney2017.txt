Mulvaney, a [[GOP Young Gun]], ran against Democratic incumbent [[John M. Spratt, Jr.|John Spratt]] for {{ushr|SC|5}}. The race was highlighted by [[Mitt Romney]]'s Free and Strong America PAC's "Take Congress Back: 10 in '10" initiative as one of the top 10 House challenger races. During the campaign, Mulvaney's involvement in the now defunct Edenmoor real estate development in [[Lancaster County, South Carolina]] came to public attention.<ref>{{cite news|last=Collins|first=Jeffrey|title=Congressman attacks opponent over land deal|url=http://www.aikenstandard.com/State/m1066-BC-SC-5thDistrict-LandD-1stLd-Writethru-10-07-0571|newspaper=Aiken Standard|date=October 8, 2010|agency=Associated Press}} {{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> Mulvaney's opponents alleged that Mulvaney misled the Lancaster County council and taxpayers to provide some $30 million in public funding for the Edenmoor real estate development and that once the public funds had been approved, Mulvaney sold his interest in the development to a third party at a substantial profit.<ref name="Edenmoor">{{cite news|last=Overman|first=Jenny|title=Mulvaney refutes latest Edenmoor accusation|url=http://www.heraldonline.com/2010/10/19/2540127/mulvaney-refutes-latest-edenmoor.html|newspaper=Rock Hill Herald|date=October 19, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Stanley|title=Mulvaney & Edenmoor – I Was There|url=http://heraldindependent.com/bookmark/10080880-Mulvaney-Edenmoor-%E2%80%93-I-Was-There|publisher=Herald Independent|date=October 29, 2010}} {{dead link|date=September 2014}}</ref> Mulvaney denied the allegations and claimed that the project's failure was due to Democratic economic policies.<ref name="Edenmoor"/> Mulvaney defeated Spratt, who had held the seat since 1983; he received 55% of the vote to Spratt's 45%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.enr-scvotes.org/SC/19077/40477/en/summary.html |title=2010 General Election |publisher=South Carolina State Election Commission |date=November 18, 2010 |accessdate=2012-05-28}}</ref>

Mulvaney's campaign against Spratt was aided by a [[501(c) organization#501(c)(4)|501(c)(4) organization]] named the Commission on Hope, Growth, and Opportunity. The group, which was established by anonymous donors and run by lobbyist Scott W.

===Tenure===
[[File:Mick Mulvaney by Gage Skidmore.jpg|left|thumb|Mulvaney speaking at a campaign event for Senator [[Rand Paul]] in Spartanburg, South Carolina in September 2015.]]
On December 10, 2013, Republican Representative [[Paul Ryan]] and Democratic Senator [[Patty Murray]] announced that they had negotiated the [[Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013]], a proposed two-year budget deal.<ref name=positivereviewHill>{{cite news|title=Ryan budget deal gets positive review at closed-door Republican conference|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/192760-gop-leaders-whip-members-on-budget-deal|accessdate=12 December 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=11 December 2013|author=Erik Wasson|author2=Russell Berman}}</ref><ref name=PRannouncement>{{cite web|title=Murray and Ryan Introduce Bipartisan Budget-Conference Agreement|url=http://budget.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=364030|publisher=House of Representatives Committee on the Budget|accessdate=12 December 2013}}</ref> The budget deal would cap the federal government's spending for Fiscal Year 2014 at $1.012 trillion and for Fiscal Year 2015 at $1.014.<ref name=CNNplainenglish>{{cite news|last=Desjardins|first=Lisa|title=The budget deal in plain English|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2013/12/10/the-budget-deal-in-plain-english/|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=CNN|date=10 December 2013}}</ref> The proposed deal would eliminate some of the spending cuts required by the sequester by $45 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in January and $18 billion of the cuts scheduled to happen in 2015.<ref name="CNNplainenglish"/> This does not decrease federal spending; instead, by reducing the amount of spending cuts the government was going to be forced to make by the sequester, it actually increases government spending by $45 billion and $18 billion over what would have been spent had the sequester remained in place. Some Republicans wanted Speaker Boehner to pursue a temporary measure that would cover the rest of Fiscal Year 2014 at the level set by the sequester – $967 billion, rather than pass this budget deal, which would have $45 billion in additional spending.<ref name=ryannottarnished>{{cite news|last=Wasson|first=Erik|title=Conservatives: Ryan not tarnished by 'bad' deal|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/192787-conservatives-say-ryan-not-tarnished-by-bad-deal|accessdate=11 December 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=December 11, 2013}}</ref>

The deal is supposed to make up for this increase in spending by raising airline fees and changing the pension contribution requirements of new federal workers.<ref name="positivereviewHill"/> According to ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'', Mulvaney is "spearheading opposition to the new budget bill."<ref name="ryannottarnished"/> Mulvaney did not blame Ryan for the budget deal, instead saying that the problem was too few conservatives had been elected to Congress to pass a budget with a greater focus on debt reduction.<ref name="ryannottarnished"/> Mulvaney said that he expected the budget deal to pass because "it was designed to get the support of defense hawks and appropriators and Democrats," not conservatives.<ref name="positivereviewHill"/>

On April 9, 2014, Representative Mulvaney offered a proposal based on the Obama proposal as a substitute amendment in order to force a vote on the President's budget request. The President's proposal failed in a vote of 2–413, although Democrats were urged by their leadership to vote against this "political stunt."<ref name=housekillsObamasbill>{{cite news|last=Marcos|first=Cristina|title=House kills Obama budget 2–413|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/203134-house-kills-obama-budget-0-xxx|accessdate=10 April 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=9 April 2014}}</ref>
