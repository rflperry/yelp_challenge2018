;Apology for the Chinese Exclusion Act
On June 18, 2012, the United States House of Representatives passed a resolution, introduced by Congresswoman Chu, that formally expresses the ''regret'' of the House of Representatives for the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], which imposed almost total restrictions on Chinese immigration and naturalization and denied Chinese-Americans basic freedoms because of their ethnicity. This was only the fourth time that the U.S. Congress issued an apology to a group of people.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/112/hres683|title=H.Res. 683 (112th)|accessdate=August 9, 2012|author=112th Congress (2012)|date=June 8, 2012 |work=Legislation|publisher=GovTrack.us|quote=Expressing the regret of the House of Representatives for the passage of laws that adversely affected the Chinese in the United States, including the Chinese Exclusion Act.}}</ref>

;Ethics
In June 2011 the House Ethics Committee began an investigation after receiving information suggesting that two of Chu's top aides had directed staffers to do campaign tasks during regular work hours.  In the course of the investigation it was found that Chu had sent two emails to her staff on how to respond to aspects of the Ethics Committee's inquiry.  While the Committee found no evidence to support that Chu was aware of the actions of her staff, they did find that the emails represented actions that interfered with the committee's investigation of the matter, and on December 11, 2014, Rep. Chu was formally reprimanded by the House Ethics Committee for interfering with their investigation of her office.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ethics.house.gov/sites/ethics.house.gov/files/APPENDIX%20A.pdf |title=Official Letter of Reproval US House of Representatives, Committee on Ethics |publisher=US House |date= |accessdate=March 14, 2015}}</ref><ref name="nj121114">{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/congress/chu-gingrey-rebuked-by-house-ethics-panel-20141211 |title=Chu, Gingrey Rebuked by House Ethics Panel |author=House, Billy |publisher=''[[National Journal]]'' |date=2014-12-11 |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Chu married [[Mike Eng]] in 1978. Eng took Chu's seat on the Monterey Park City Council in 2001, when Chu left the council after getting elected to the [[California State Assembly|Assembly]], and in 2006 he took Chu's seat on the Assembly, when Chu left the Assembly.

Chu's nephew, [[Lance Corporal Harry Lew]], a [[United States Marine Corps|US Marine]], committed suicide while serving in [[Afghanistan]] on April 3, 2011, allegedly as a result of [[hazing]] from fellow Marines after Lew allegedly repeatedly fell asleep during his watch. Chu described her nephew as a patriotic American and said that those responsible must be brought to justice.<ref>McAvoy, Audrey.
