'''Patrick Joseph "Pat" Tiberi''' (born October 21, 1962) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Ohio|12}}, serving since 2001. He is a member of the [[United States Republican Party|Republican Party]]. He previously served in the [[Ohio House of Representatives]].

The district includes many [[Columbus, Ohio|Columbus]] suburbs north and east of the City.

==Early life, education and career==
The son of Italian immigrants, Tiberi was born in Columbus and attended the city's Woodward Park Middle school, then [[Northland High School (Columbus, Ohio)|Northland High School]]. Tiberi attended [[Ohio State University|The Ohio State University]] where he was a member of [[The Ohio State University Marching Band]]. He graduated from The Ohio State University in 1985 with a degree in journalism and was the first in his family to graduate from college.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiberi.house.gov/biography/|title=Biography - U.S. Congressman Pat Tiberi|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> He was later awarded an [[honorary doctorate]] in the [[Humanities]] by [[Capital University]] in May 2005.

Upon graduation from college, Tiberi worked as a realtor for RE/MAX Achievers, a franchise of [[RE/MAX]], located in Lewis Center, Ohio. He was elected to the [[Ohio House of Representatives]] in 1993, and he soon rose to the position of House Majority Leader.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
Tiberi has authored legislation that made it easier for returning military veterans to receive federal jobs and provided for more federal assistance to caregivers of incapacitated adults. Both of the bills were passed in 2006.

Tiberi voted against the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], saying the bill was "loaded with [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s grab bag of big spending wishes." Following passage of the bill, Tiberi wrote a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture [[Tom Vilsack]] in an effort to bring stimulus money to his district.<ref>{{cite news|last=Koff|first=Stephen|title=Ohio congressman blasted stimulus, but now wants a piece of the pie|url=http://www.cleveland.com/open/index.ssf/2010/02/ohio_congressman_blasted_stimu.html|newspaper=The Plain Dealer|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last=McElhatton|first=Jim|title=Stimulus foes see value in seeking cash|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/feb/09/stimulus-foes-see-value-in-seeking-cash/|newspaper=The Washington Times|date=February 9, 2010}}</ref>

Tiberi has been described as loyal to Speaker [[John Boehner]].<ref>Jake Sherman and John Bresnahan (December 20, 2012), [http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/john-boehners-plan-b-toughest-hour-85391_Page2.html Boehner's toughest hour] ''[[Politico]]''</ref>

===Policy positions===

====Older Americans====
Then-chairman of the Select Education Subcommittee, Pat Tiberi wrote the bill that reauthorized the Older Americans Act through fiscal year 2011. This bill provides most of the funding for social services and nutritional programs for the nation's seniors.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiberi.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=3791|title=Strengthening Retirement Security - U.S. Congressman Pat Tiberi|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Pat Tiberi received an 86 from the Retire Safe-Positions and a 10 from Alliance for Retired Americans-Lifetime Score.<ref name="votesmart.org">{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/8404/pat-tiberi#.UKx0I47EWAG|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Congressman Tiberi has introduced other legislation to improve care for older Americans including writing and sponsoring The Older Americans Act Amendments of 2006. Pat Tiberi supports a full repeal of Obamacare under the statement that "government has no place in getting between a patient's relationship with their doctor."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiberi.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=286347|title=TIBERI STATEMENT: ANOTHER STEP IN REPEALING OBAMACARE|date=March 22, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

====Education reform====
Pat Tiberi supports reform to the No Child Left Behind bill. He has introduced legislation to improve local flexibility by allowing some school districts to go to the Secretary of Education and present their own plan for the allocation of Title 1 federal funding for approval. This amendment was signed into law in 2002.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiberi.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=1809|title=Sorry - U.S. Congressman Pat Tiberi|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> During the 109th Congress, Congressman Tiberi served as the Chair the Education and Workforce Subcommittee on Select Education—a subcommittee with jurisdiction over issues related to international and graduate education programs. The Teachers of English to Speakers of Other Languages (TESOL)-Positions rated Congressman Tiberi at 50%.<ref name="votesmart.org"/>

====Government reform====
During his first Congressional campaign, Pat Tiberi made the campaign promise to make government more accountable to citizens. During the 110th Congress he supported proposed reforms to make earmarks, lines inserted into a bill that direct money to a member of Congress, more transparent. Congressman Tiberi's goal is to introduce reform to give the president the authority to rid congressional bill of unrelated spending in bills.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tiberi.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=1916|title=Reining in the Federal Government - U.S. Congressman Pat Tiberi|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref> Congressman Tiberi also wants to bring reform through a searchable database that would include an assessment of every piece of federal funding and the Education Oversight Subcommittee that he was appointed Vice-Chairman to in his first year in Congress. Citizens Against Government Waste-Positions gave Pat Tiberi a 78% rating.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/13/rating/5940#.UKyCC47EWAE|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|publisher=|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}</ref>

====IRS investigation====
Tiberi spoke at a [[Ripon Society]] forum and addressed the [[2013 IRS scandal]] and tax reform. Tiberi declared the IRS is one of the worst scandals he has seen in [[History of the United States|American history]], stating that "...it's not like any other. It has Democrats, non-political independents, business owners, other individuals and people who don’t pay attention to government, kind of on their toes, because they know it can happen to them." The Congressman went on to say that the only way out was to show bipartisan partnership among the Administration in order to "...get this scandal off the front page [and] working with Republicans to get comprehensive tax reform done in a way that simplifies our code."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_5-21-13.htm |title=This is something that sends chills down regular Americans’ spines |date=May 21, 2013|publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=June 10, 2013}}</ref>

==Legislation==

===School safety===
Tiberi introduced a bill with [[Ron Kind|Rep. Ron Kind (D-WI)]] that gives a tax credit to law enforcement officers for any income they earn doing substitute teaching. Tiberi and Kind introduced the bill as one way to add security to schools. The bill was introduced in Washington, D.C. on April 12.<ref>Jim East, [http://riponadvance.com/news/tiberi-kind-school-safety-bill-would-incentivize-law-enforcement-to-substitute-teach/ "Tiberi-Kind school safety bill would incentivize law enforcement to substitute teach"], The Ripon Advance, July 30, 2013. (Retrieved August 26, 2013)</ref>

=== Workforce ===
In 2014, Tiberi cosponsored legislation called the [[Save American Workers Act of 2013]] that would make a 40 hours, instead of 30, the standard definition of [[Full-time and part-time work|full-time]] work.<ref>Martin, Aaron. [http://riponadvance.com/news/tiberi-outlines-employer-mandates-impact-businesses/6389 "Tiberi outlines employer mandate's impact on businesses,"] ''The Ripon Advance''. January 29, 2014. Retrieved January 31, 2014.</ref>

=== Tax policy ===
On April 10, 2014, Tiberi introduced the [[America's Small Business Tax Relief Act of 2014 (H.R. 4457; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend section 179 of the [[Internal Revenue Code]], which mostly affects small- to medium-sized businesses, to retroactively and permanently extend from January 1, 2014, increased the cap on the amount of investment that can be immediately deducted from [[taxable income]].<ref name=cbo4457>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4457|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45326|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=June 12, 2014}}</ref> The bill would return the tax code to its 2013 status and make the change permanent.<ref name=PomerleauTaxFound>{{cite web|last1=Pomerleau|first1=Kyle|title=Tiberi Bill on permanent Extension of Small Business Expensing|url=http://taxfoundation.org/blog/tiberi-bill-permanent-extension-small-business-expensing|publisher=Tax Foundation|accessdate=June 12, 2014|date=April 22, 2014}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 2000, Tiberi ran for and won the House seat that was vacated by nine-term incumbent and Chairman of the House Budget Committee [[John Kasich]], who retired to work as a consultant for Lehman Brothers.  He only won by nine points in a district that had long been considered to be far friendlier to the Democrats than the neighboring 15th, despite Kasich's long tenure.  However, Tiberi hasn't faced a close race since, in part because his district was redrawn after the 2000 census. In 2006, Tiberi won reelection after defeating former Democratic Congressman [[Bob Shamansky]].

===2010===
