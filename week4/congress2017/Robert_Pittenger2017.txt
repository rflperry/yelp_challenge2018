Pittenger won the general election on November 6, defeating Democratic Mecklenburg County Commission Chairwoman [[Jennifer Roberts]] 52%–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=740216|title=Our Campaigns - NC District 09 Race - Nov 06, 2012|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://results.enr.clarityelections.com/NC/42923/114047/Web01/en/summary.html |title=Election Results : North Carolina State Board of Elections |website=Results.enr.clarityelections.com |accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>  While Pittenger lost the district's share of Mecklenburg County (47%), he ran up huge margins in the [[Union County, North Carolina|Union]] (63%) and [[Iredell County|Iredell]] (64%) portions of the district. Still, it was the closest that a Republican had come to losing this district since 1986. He took office in January 2013.

===Tenure===
On December 2, 2013, Pittenger introduced the [[Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act of 2013]], which became {{USPL|113|104}}.<ref name=3627allactions>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3627 – All Actions|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3627/actions|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref> The law broadens the coverage of current laws that address domestic assaults by certain repeat offenders.<ref name=cbo3627>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 3627|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/44948|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref> The law also requires the [[United States Department of Justice]] to write a report on [[child abuse]] prevention laws in all U.S. states and territories, "with a particular focus on penalties for cases of severe child abuse."<ref name=PRpittenger1>{{cite web|title=Kilah's Law|url=http://pittenger.house.gov/KilahsLaw|publisher=House Office of Congressman Pittenger|accessdate=May 23, 2014}}</ref> Pittenger said that the bill "will strengthen laws and help prevent child abuse," noting that "it is sickening to realize that we need such laws."<ref name="PRpittenger1"/> After the bill's passage, Pittenger called it "a victory on behalf of children," but said that "no happy, bright, little girl should ever become the face of child abuse legislation."<ref name=WBTVmay20>{{cite news|title=President signs Kilah Davenport Child Protection Act into law|url=http://www.wbtv.com/story/25567793/president-signs-kilah-davenport-child-protection-act-into-law|accessdate=May 23, 2014|newspaper=WBTV|date=May 20, 2014}}</ref>

===FBI Criminal Investigation===
On August 11, 2015, [[WSOC-TV|WSOC]] confirmed with Pittenger that he was the subject of an active [[FBI]] criminal investigation, with the [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] local office investigating. Nothing specific was stated by the FBI at this time and Pittenger would only elaborate to say the inquiry has to do with his former real estate business, which he was said to have retired prior to taking the oath of office.

===Statement on black protests===
On September 22, 2016, in an interview in the wake of protests over the [[shooting of Keith Lamont Scott]], Pittenger said that the violence in Charlotte stems from protesters who “hate white people because white people are successful and they’re not.” The remark drew immediate international condemnation as racist. Fellow North Carolina congressman [[G. K. Butterfield]] called the remark "devastatingly ignorant and divisive." Pittenger quickly apologized for the statement.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.newsobserver.com/news/politics-government/politics-columns-blogs/under-the-dome/article103536037.html|title=Pittenger apologizes for saying Charlotte protesters ‘hate white people’|website=Newsobserver.com|accessdate=September 25, 2016}}</ref>
