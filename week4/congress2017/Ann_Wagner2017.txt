== Early life and education ==
Wagner was born and raised in [[St. Louis, Missouri|St. Louis]]. She attended [[Cor Jesu Academy]], a private Catholic all-girls school in South County, and graduated from the [[University of Missouri]] in 1984 with a [[Bachelor of Science in Business Administration|BSBA]] from the business school with an emphasis in [[logistics]]. After college, she went to work in the private sector and held management positions at [[Hallmark Cards]] in [[Kansas City]] and [[Ralston Purina]] in [[St. Louis]].<ref name="annwagner.com">{{cite web|url=http://annwagner.com/meet-ann/ |accessdate=October 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131004215542/http://annwagner.com/meet-ann/ |archivedate=October 4, 2013 }}</ref>

== Pre-congressional political career ==

===1990s===
Wagner entered [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politics in 1990, heading the GOP's efforts during the [[decennial]] redistricting of Missouri. In 1992, she was state director of the unsuccessful campaign for the reelection of President [[George H.W. Bush]] and Vice President [[Dan Quayle]].

===2000s===

====Chairwoman of Missouri GOP====
She was elected to her first term of office as chair of the Missouri Republican Party in 1999, becoming the first woman to occupy the position. Her most notable achievement in that role came during her second two-year term when she oversaw the party's taking of majority control of both chambers of the [[Missouri General Assembly]], winning the [[Missouri State Senate|Senate]] in a 2001 [[special election]] and the [[Missouri House of Representatives|House]] in the 2002 [[general election]], the first time this had been seen for over 40 years. During her third term, the party held its majorities in both chambers and also took the Governor's seat for the first time in 12 years with the election of [[Matt Blunt]] in 2004, giving the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since 1921. Her six years as chairperson witnessed [[George W. Bush]] carry Missouri in both of his presidential bids and also saw the Republican Party win a majority of the state's congressional delegation.

====National campaigning====
In 2001, she took office as a co-chair of the [[Republican National Committee]], and helped preside over the [[2004 Republican National Convention]]. In this position, she took a strong role in directing the development of the Winning Women initiative, whose aim was to improve the image of the GOP towards women and demonstrate the relevance of its platform to them. Her work with the committee took her to 48 states. In January 2005, she left her role as co-chair after one term.

In 2004, Wagner was a fundraising "[[Bush Pioneer|ranger]]" for President George W. Bush.

====U.S. Ambassadorship====
On February 20, 2005, Wagner was elected to a fourth term as Chair of the Missouri Republican Party. On May 16, she was nominated by President Bush to the position of [[United States Ambassador to Luxembourg]], although she had no previous diplomatic experience at the time. On July 16, 2005, she was confirmed in the post by a voice vote in the [[United States Senate]], after which [[U.S. Senator]] [[Jim Talent]] (R-Mo.) said that she was, "A considerate woman, whose character and abilities uniquely qualify her to represent our nation."

On August 1, she was sworn in as Ambassador by [[United States Secretary of State|U.S. Secretary of State]] [[Condoleezza Rice]] in the [[Benjamin Franklin]] Room of the [[Harry S. Truman]] Building of the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]] in [[Washington D.C.]].<ref name=bizjournal>{{cite news|title=Wagner confirmed as ambassador to Luxembourg|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/stories/2005/06/13/daily47.html?jst=b_ln_hl|accessdate=10 November 2012|newspaper=St. Louis Business Journal|date=June 17, 2005}}</ref>

===2010s===

====2010 U.S. Senate election====
{{See also|United States Senate election in Missouri, 2010}}
After returning from Luxembourg, Wagner served as Chairwoman for [[Roy Blunt]]'s successful [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2010|2010 U.S. Senate campaign]]. Blunt defeated [[Missouri Secretary of State]] [[Robin Carnahan]] 54%-41% to retain the seat in the Republican column following [[Kit Bond]]'s retirement from the seat.

====2011 RNC Chairman election====

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2012#District 2}}
Wagner announced her candidacy for [[Missouri's 2nd congressional district]] after incumbent Republican [[U.S. Representative]] [[Todd Akin]] announced his unsuccessful bid to challenge incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[U.S. Senator]] [[Claire McCaskill]]. Wagner received endorsements from [[Governor of New Jersey|Governor]] [[Chris Christie]] of [[New Jersey]], former [[Governor of Arkansas|Governor]] [[Mike Huckabee]] of [[Arkansas]], former [[U.S. Attorney General]] [[John Ashcroft]], and the [[pro-life]] women's group the [[Susan B.

==Recent events==
Congresswoman Wagner recently spoke at a [[Ripon Society]] forum and addressed the [[2013 IRS scandal]] and tax reform. Wagner stated that it was the Administration's lack of oversight and connection to the issue that has caused these problems. [It is] "...a failure of leadership when you have a president who is so disconnected‚Äînot from our conference and our party, but from his own Democrat Party and other leadership here on the Hill. This is the trickledown effect of real arrogance here."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.riponsociety.org/news_5-21-13.htm |title=This is something that sends chills down regular Americans‚Äô spines |date=May 21, 2013|publisher=The Ripon Society |accessdate=10 June 2013}}</ref>
