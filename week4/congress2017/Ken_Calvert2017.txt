'''Kenneth Stanton "Ken" Calvert''' (born June 8, 1953) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CA|42}}, and previously the 44th and 43rd, serving since 1993. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district is part of the [[Inland Empire (California)|Inland Empire]] and south Orange County areas of [[Southern California]].

==Early life, education, and business career==
Calvert was born in [[Corona, California]], to Marceline Hamblen and Ira D. Calvert, Jr.,<ref>{{cite web |title=Kenneth Stanton "Ken" Calvert |publisher=RootsWeb |url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/calvert.htm}}</ref> and still lives in Corona. In 1970, shortly after high school, he joined the campaigns of former state legislator [[Victor Veysey]]. Calvert worked in Veysey's Washington, D.C., office as an intern after a 1972 victory. He graduated from [[Corona High School]] in 1971.

Calvert received an [[Associate of Arts]] degree from [[Chaffey College|Chaffey Community College]] in 1973 and a Bachelor of Arts degree [[San Diego State University]] in 1975. After graduation, he managed his family's restaurant, the Jolly Fox, in Corona for five years. He then entered the real estate industry and ran Ken Calvert Real Properties until he was elected to Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
In 1982, the 29-year-old Calvert ran for the [[United States House of Representatives]] to represent a newly drawn district. He narrowly lost the Republican primary to Riverside County Supervisor [[Al McCandless]], who had been the choice of the Republican establishment. McCandless went on to win the general election.

Calvert was first elected to the House in 1992, when McCandless was re-elected in a different district. Calvert won the general election with 47% of the vote (a plurality, but he was the highest vote-getter), defeating Democrat [[Mark Takano]] by 519 votes. In 1994, he was challenged in the Republican primary by Joe Khoury and won renomination by only 51% to 49%. He was re-elected in the 1994 general election with 55 percent, again defeating Takano. Ironically, he now serves in the House alongside his former opponent; Takano was elected to Congress in an adjacent district in 2012.

In 1996, he was re-elected with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Democrat Guy Kimbrough. In 1998 he defeated Democrat Mike Rayburn with 55 percent of the vote. Calvert won again in 2000 with 74 percent of the vote, facing no major-party opposition.

Calvert was re-elected in 2002, defeating Louis Vandenberg with 64 percent of the vote. He defeated Vandenberg again in 2004 with 61 percent of the vote. Vandenberg, a college administrator, was again Calvert's opponent in the November 2006 election.[http://www.vandenbergforcongress.com/] Calvert won with 60 percent of the vote; Vandenburg got 38 percent.<ref>California Secretary of State, [http://vote.ss.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/4400.htm 2006 general election results], U.S. Congress District 44. Retrieved November 14, 2006.</ref>

In 2008, he had a surprisingly close race. He ran against Democratic candidate [[Bill Hedrick]], receiving 52% of the vote.<ref>California Secretary of State, [http://vote.sos.ca.gov/Returns/usrep/4459.htm 2008 general election results]{{dead link|date=October 2010}}, U.S. Congress District 44.

In 2010, [[Bill Hedrick]] ran against Calvert again. While most pundits such as Larry Sabato expected him to lose again,<ref>{{cite web |title=California (44) House 2010 |date=August 9, 2010 |work=Sabato's Crystal Ball |publisher=University of Virginia Center for Politics |url=http://www.centerforpolitics.org/crystalball/california-44-house-2010/ |quote=Bill Hedrick faces an uphill battle to defeat Ken Calvert....}}</ref> sources such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' ranked the race more competitive.

The ''[[National Journal]]''{{'}}s [[Cook Political Report]] named Calvert one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, largely due to his district's rapidly growing Hispanic population.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting |author= David Wasserman and Julia Edwards|date=April 15, 2011|work= Cook Political Report|publisher= National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011}}</ref> Despite this Calvert defeated opponent Michael Williamson with 61% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224021529/http://www.sos.ca.gov:80/elections/sov/2012-general/sov-complete.pdf |archivedate=December 24, 2012 |df=mdy }}</ref>

===Tenure===
;111th and 112th Congress
On June 10, 2009, Calvert introduced H.R. 2788, the Distinguished Flying Cross National Memorial Act. This Act designates a national memorial at March Field Air Museum in honor of current and former members of the armed forces who have been awarded the [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]]. Calvert worked to assemble a bipartisan group of 48 cosponsors for this legislation. On March 19, 2010, H.R. 2788 unanimously passed the House of Representatives.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.R.2788:@@@R Bill Summary & Status – 111th Congress (2009 – 2010) – H.R.2788 – Major Congressional Actions – THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Calvert introduced H. Res. 377, a bill recognizing Armed Forces Day and the exemplary service of the members of the United States Armed Forces on April 29, 2009. This bill received 70 bipartisan cosponsorships and passed the House of Representatives unanimously on May 14, 2009.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d111:H.RES.377:@@@R Bill Summary & Status – 111th Congress (2009 – 2010) – H.RES.377 – Major Congressional Actions – THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

Calvert introduced H. Res. 1219 to support the designation of a National Child Awareness Month to promote awareness of children's charities and youth-serving organizations across the United States on March 25, 2010. Calvert assembled 40 bipartisan cosponsors for this bill and on July 19, 2010, this bill passed the House of Representatives with unanimous support.<ref>[http://hdl.loc.gov/loc.uscongress/legislation.111hres1219 Bill Summary & Status – 111th Congress (2009 – 2010) – H.RES.1219 – THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

;E-Verify
Calvert is the original author of the [[E-Verify]] law, the only employment verification program available to employers to check the work authorization status of newly hired employees. In 1995, he introduced H.R. 502, which was later included in the immigration reform bill, H.R. 2202.<ref>1996 Congressional Quarterly Almanac</ref> The immigration reforms were later wrapped into the FY1997 Omnibus Appropriations Act.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/D?c104:15:./temp/~c1049CzcDF Bill Text – 104th Congress (1995-1996) – THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> The original program, known as the Basic Pilot Program, was only available to five states and employers used a call in system. In the 12 years since its implementation, the Basic Pilot Program, now known as E-Verify, has expanded nationwide and has over 100,000 employers using the system. Two states, Arizona and Mississippi, have made use of E-Verify mandatory. In the 111th Congress Calvert again introduced legislation to make use of E-Verify mandatory.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.19.IH Bill Text – 111th Congress (2009-2010) – THOMAS (Library of Congress)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

;CALFED
As Chairman of the Resources Subcommittee on Water and Power, Calvert introduced H.R. 2828, The Water Supply, Reliability, and Environmental Improvement Act, which reauthorizes the CALFED Bay-Delta program. The CALFED Bay-Delta Program is a unique collaboration among 25 state and federal agencies that came together with a mission: to improve California's water supply and the ecological health of the San Francisco Bay/Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta.<ref>[http://www.calwater.ca.gov/calfed/about/index.html About CALFED<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> H.R. 2828 provides a long-term federal authorization for the western region for water supply and reliability.

==Controversies==

===Real estate investments===
Calvert's May 2005 financial disclosure statement showed that he owned eight parcels of land, most in Riverside County, as of December 31, 2004.<ref name="LAT-5-15-06">Tom Hamburger, Lance Pugmire and Richard Simon, [http://coburn.senate.gov/ffm/index.cfm?FuseAction=LatestNews.NewsStories&ContentRecord_id=39757b60-802a-23ad-472d-4332fb0b097b "Calvert's Land of Plenty: He has earmarked funds for Riverside County projects near properties he sold for a profit"], ''Los Angeles Times'', May 15, 2006 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060727230105/http://coburn.senate.gov/ffm/index.cfm?FuseAction=LatestNews.NewsStories&ContentRecord_id=39757b60-802a-23ad-472d-4332fb0b097b |date=July 27, 2006 }}</ref> In 2005, Calvert and Harpole paid $550,000 for a {{convert|4.3|acre|m2|sing=on}} parcel just south of [[March Air Reserve Base]]. Calvert's real estate firm, where Calvert's brother, Quint, is the president,<ref name="PE-8-17-06">David Danelski and Sandra Stokely, [http://www.pe.com/localnews/inland/stories/PE_News_Local_D_calvert18.3c5082e.html "Sale of park site draws questions"], ''Press-Enterprise'', August 17, 2006</ref> and Halpole is vice president, received brokerage fees from the seller, Rod Smith of [[Greeley, Colorado]], for representing both buyer and seller in the deal. Less than a year later, Calvert and Harpole sold the property for nearly $1 million. During the time he owned the land, Calvert used the earmarking process to secure $8 million in federal funds for a freeway interchange {{convert|16|mi|km}} from the property, and an additional $1.5 million to support commercial development of the area around the base.

In early summer 2005, Harpole bought property with a group of investors at 20330 Temescal Canyon Road, a few blocks from the site of the what was then a proposed interchange at Cajalco and I-15. The purchase price was $975,000. Within six months, after the bill passed that provided federal funding for the interchange, they sold the parcel for $1.45 million. Calvert's firm took a commission on the sale.<ref name="LAT-5-15-06"/>

On May 19, 2006, [[The Press-Enterprise (California)|The Riverside Press-Enterprise]], the sixth largest newspaper in California, editorialized that The Los Angeles Times got the facts wrong and in fact, there was no impropriety on the part of Calvert.<ref>{{cite news |location=Riverside |newspaper=The Press Enterprise |author=editorial |title=False Alarm |date=May 19, 2006 |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/opinion/editorials/stories/PE_OpEd_Opinion_S_op_19_ed_calvert3.2283d8ef.html |archiveurl=http://calvert.house.gov/uploadedfiles/press_enterprise_-_false_alarm_editorial.pdf |archivedate=unknown}}</ref> Calvert has stated that all requests for federal funding come from local entities.

===Jurupa Community Services District===
In the spring of 2006, Calvert and Harpole purchased {{convert|4|acre|m2}} of land from Jurupa Community Services District (JCSD), a water and sewer district in northwestern Riverside County, for $1.2 million, along with five investment partners who jointly had a one-third interest. A newspaper investigation reported in August 2006 that the district apparently never first offered the land to other public agencies, a requirement of state law intended to provide more recreational land. The district's general manager said other agencies were notified, but representatives of those agencies said they received no such notice. The district could not provide evidence of the notification, saying relevant files had been misplaced.

The community services district did not advertise or list the land for sale, a practice required by counties and many other public agencies seeking top dollar on behalf of taxpayers. District general manager Carole McGreevy, who is stepping down from that position in late 2006 and retiring in late 2007, said the district proclaimed the land surplus in the early 1990s after it was no longer needed for flood control. The record of that decision was among the missing documents, as was the updated appraisal that McGreevy said was done in May 2005.

The Calvert partnership plans to build a mini-storage business.<ref name="PE-8-17-06"/> In August 2008, the Jurupa Area Recreation and Parks District (JARPD) filed a lawsuit against JCSD, alleging fraud in the sale of the land.  In August 2009, the FBI was looking into the lawsuit. A spokeswoman for Calvert said he had not been contacted by the FBI or a grand jury and did not believe that he was a focus of any investigation.<ref>{{cite news |title=Calvert denies he's subject of FBI investigation |author=[[Susan Crabtree]] |work=The Hill |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/63757-rep-calvert-denies-hes-subject-of-fbi-investigation}}</ref>

The JCSD and JARPD reached a settlement to the dispute on October 7, 2010, and the agreement stated that Stadium Properties, of which Calvert is one-third silent partner, had no knowledge that the JCSD had not properly noticed the sale of land.<ref>{{cite news |author=Sandra Stokley |author2=Ben Goad |date=October 8, 2010 |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/stories/PE_News_Local_D_settle08.2fdf80f.html |title=JURUPA: Lawsuit triggered by land deal settled |newspaper=The Press Enterprise |location=Riverside |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101120101352/http://www.pe.com/localnews/stories/PE_News_Local_D_settle08.2fdf80f.html |archivedate=November 20, 2010}}</ref>

=== Sex with known prostitute ===
In 1993, two [[Corona, California]], police officers found Calvert with a prostitute in his car. Calvert told the police that he and the woman were "just talking". ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' later went to court to force the Corona police to release the police report.<ref>Robinson, Jack. "Two years have brought Calvert crises, lessons". ''[[The Press-Enterprise]]'' (Riverside). November 3, 1994. p. B01.</ref> After the report was released, Calvert admitted to having sex in his car with the woman, although the police did not have enough evidence to arrest him, as there was no witness to any exchange of money.<ref>Tom Gorman, [http://articles.latimes.com/1994-04-27/news/mn-50942_1_riverside-county "Scandal Imperils Young Political Career : Politics: After months of denial, a Riverside congressman admits sexual relations with a known prostitute.
