====Immigration Reform====
As House Judiciary Chairman for the 113th congress, Goodlatte has contrasted the House approach to immigration reform from the Senate by requiring that the various issues be taken on a piece-by-piece basis with an emphasis on both border and interior enforcement measures. So far the House Judiciary Committee has passed four immigration related bills:<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/markups113.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131030110656/http://judiciary.house.gov/hearings/markups113.html |date=October 30, 2013 }}</ref>

* H.R. 2131, the "SKILLS Visa Act"<ref name="judiciary.house.gov"/>

====Balanced Budget Amendment====
One of Representative Goodlatte's top legislative initiatives was his Constitutional amendment to require a balanced federal budget. Goodlatte wrote and put forward both the "clean" Balanced Budget Amendment which had a higher chance of actually passing the House and the Senate as well as a version that makes it harder to increase taxes by requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/conservatives-congress-vote-weak-balanced-budget-a6580|title=Conservatives to Congress: Vote NO on a Weak Balanced Budget Amendment|author=Mattie Duppler|date=2011-11-09|accessdate=2012-06-03|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/192699-gop-favors-clean-balanced-budget-amendment-sponsor-says |title=Sponsor says 'clean' balanced budget amendment has edge for floor vote |publisher=TheHill |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> However, Representatives [[Paul Ryan]], [[Justin Amash]], [[David Dreier]] and [[Louie Gohmert]] voted against the "clean" amendment because it could have allowed taxes to be raised on Americans. Representative Ryan released a statement after the vote: "I’m concerned that this version will lead to a much bigger government fueled by more taxes. Spending is the problem, yet this version of the Balanced Budget Amendment makes it more likely taxes will be raised, government will grow, and economic freedom will be diminished. Without a limit on government spending, I cannot support this Amendment.”<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/why-ryan-voted-against-balanced-budget-amendment|title=Washington Examiner|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

Bob Goodlatte voted to increase the U.S. debt ceiling seven times and has voted to pass budgets from Democratic as well as Republican administrations. He voted for Bill Clinton's Budget Act in July, 1997 and Barack Obama's Budget Act of 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/112-2011/h690 |title=Budget Control Act of 2011 |date=August 1, 2011}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/votes/105-1997/h345 |title=H.R. 2015 |date=July 24, 1997}}</ref>

====Agriculture====
Before his appointment as Ranking Republican of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]] at the start of the [[110th United States Congress|110th Congress]], Goodlatte served as Chairman of the full Committee. He was elected to serve as Chairman of the full House Agriculture Committee in January 2003 at the start of the [[108th United States Congress|108th Congress]]. He served as Chairman of the Committee throughout the 108th and [[109th United States Congress|109th]] Congresses, convening 132 Full and Subcommittee hearings and guiding 38 bills under the Committee’s jurisdiction to the President’s desk to be signed into law. He has served on the House Agriculture Committee since first being elected to Congress in November 1992. Before becoming Chairman of the full Committee, Goodlatte served as Chairman of the [[United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on Department Operations, Oversight, and Credit|Subcommittee on Department, Operations, Oversight, Nutrition and Forestry]]. An active subcommittee chairman, he held fourteen hearings in the [[107th United States Congress|107th Congress]] alone. The hearings covered a wide range of issues including implementation of the national fire plan, domestic nutrition programs, [[invasive species]], and civil rights programs at the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]]. He served as a conferee on the [[Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002]].

He is also a coauthor of the bill, as referenced by Chairman Lamar Smith,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY38vdASyqA&feature=youtu.be&t=1h43m30s|date=2011-12-15|title=SOPA Markup Hearings}}</ref> Congresswoman Waters,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY38vdASyqA&feature&t=2h14m12s|date=2011-12-15|title=SOPA Markup Hearings}}</ref> and Goodlatte himself<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TY38vdASyqA&feature=youtu.be&t=1h42m37s|date=2011-12-15|title=SOPA Markup Hearings}}</ref> during Markup hearings for SOPA.

SOPA's critics charge that copyright owners are able to seek immediate recourse for copyrights violations through the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act]] as well as [[Title 17 of the United States Code]]. Technology engineers, website owners and venture capitalists charge that the bill will hurt Internet architecture, decrease tech industry job growth and unnecessarily burden and increase the costs of doing business for domestic website owners and operators. Free Speech advocates and conservatives charge that the bill centralizes authority at the executive branch, which might use it to prevent search engines and [[Internet Services Provider]]s from delivering dissenting websites to customers; violates the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]]; establishes Internet firewalls; and hinders online users from sharing information.<ref>{{cite speech|url=http://americanrhetoric.com/speeches/katherineoyamahorjudiciarycomtestmt.htm|first=Katherine|last=Oyama|date=2011-11-16|accessdate=2012-06-03|title=Opening Statement to the HOR Judiciary Committee Hearing on H.R. 3261, the Stop Online Piracy Act|publisher=American Rhetoric}}</ref>

The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. Prior to it being added to the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], the gambling provisions had not been debated by any [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].<ref>[http://www.gamblingandthelaw.com/columns/2006_act.htm Nelson Rose: The Unlawful Internet gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 Analyzed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122054343/http://www.gamblingandthelaw.com/columns/2006_act.htm |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref> The bill was made sure to exclude online gambling. They claimed moral reasons for pushing for a ban on Internet gambling, but critics charge that it was due to campaign contributions from Microsoft and Steam .<ref>[http://www.casinogamblingweb.com/gambling-news/gambling-law/inside_the_goodlatte_conspiracy_the_good_fund_the_uigea_47855.html Inside the Goodlatte Conspiracy]</ref>

Goodlatte sat on the [[105th Congress|105th United States Congress]] and introduced [[NET Act]] on July 25, 1997, which removed the requirement of financial gain for criminal prosecution of [[copyright infringement]].<ref>{{USbill|105|hr|2265}}</ref>  NET Act was passed only after the House suspended the rules.<ref>[http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d105:HR02265:@@@Z Bill Summary & Status 105th Congress (1997–1998) H.R.2265]</ref>

===Legislation===
On September 12, 2013, Goodlatte introduced the [[Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act (H.R. 3086; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would amend the [[Internet Tax Freedom Act]] to make permanent the ban on state and local taxation of Internet access and on multiple or discriminatory taxes on [[electronic commerce]].<ref name=3086sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3086 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3086|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=15 July 2014}}</ref> Goodlatte wrote an op-ed in ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' arguing strongly in favor of the bill. Goodlatte said that in "our new digital economy" a "computer and internet access serve as a gateway – if not a necessity – for the American Dream. Millions of Americans now rely on the internet to run their businesses, to educate themselves, to seek new opportunities, to research and write, and to communicate with family and friends."<ref name=GoodlatteHill>{{cite news|last1=Goodlatte|first1=Bob|title=Make Internet access tax ban permanent|url=http://thehill.com/opinion/op-ed/212228-make-internet-access-tax-ban-permanent|accessdate=16 July 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=15 July 2014}}</ref> According to Goodlatte, the bill was necessary to protect the American people and their ability to access the internet from the high monetary barriers that would be created if states were allowed to tax internet access.<ref name="GoodlatteHill"/>

On March 27, 2014, Goodlatte introduced the [[Debbie Smith Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4323; 113th Congress)]] into the House.
