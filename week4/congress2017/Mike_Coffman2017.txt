'''Michael''' "'''Mike'''" '''Coffman''' (born March 19, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|CO|6}}, serving since 2009. A member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], he previously served as the  [[Secretary of State of Colorado]] (2007–2009) and as [[Colorado State Treasurer]] (1999–2005 and 2006–2007).

==Early life, education, and business career==
Michael Coffman was born on March 19, 1955 at [[Fort Leonard Wood (military base)|Fort Leonard Wood]], [[Missouri]], to Harold and Dorothy Coffman, and is one of five children. His father served in the [[United States Army]] at Fort Leonard Wood, and after 1964, at [[Fitzsimons Army Medical Center]] in [[Aurora, Colorado]].

In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], under the [[G.I. Bill]] graduating in 1979 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].<ref>[http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-coffman--CO-H Mike Coffman (R), Winner U.S. Representative – CO6], Election 2012, [[Wall Street Journal]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coffman Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=Mike Coffman U.S. Representative|accessdate=December 2, 2014}}</ref> He also studied at [[DG Vaishnav College|Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and the [[University of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]] for a year. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserves]], serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based [[property management]] firm, serving as senior [[shareholder]] until 2000.

==State politics==

===Legislature===
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1994. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave-of-absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service to the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006 he returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service.  Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again. When State Senator [[Bill Owens (Colorado politician)|Bill Owens]] resigned his seat to become state treasurer, the party's vacancy committee named Coffman the replacement in December 1994. In 1996, he was elected to a full term to the [[Colorado State Senate]] unopposed.<ref>http://www.sos.state.co.us/pubs/elections/ElectionArchives/1996/General/1996StateSenateResults.pdf {{dead link|date=April 2014}}</ref> He became the Chairman of the Finance Committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=House of Representatives|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}</ref>

===Statewide offices===
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=882|title=CO Treasurer Race |date=November 3, 1998|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator [[Terry Phillips (politician)|Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=878|title=CO Treasurer Race |date=November 5, 2002|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], where he helped support the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]], which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected [[Colorado Secretary of State]] with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=179258|title=CO Secretary of State Race |date=November 7, 2006|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>
