'''Kevin Patrick Brady''' (born April 11, 1955) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|TX|8}}, serving since 1997. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. The district includes a large swath of suburban and rural territory north of [[Houston, Texas|Houston]].

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Brady was born in [[Vermillion, South Dakota]], one of five children of William F. and Nancy A. Brady. His father, a lawyer, was killed in 1967 in a courtroom shooting in [[Rapid City, South Dakota|Rapid City]] when Brady was 12 years old.<ref>{{cite journal|last1 = AP|title = Wild Shooting Spree Caught On Tape|journal = Daytona Beach Morning Journal|date = September 27, 1967|volume = XLII|issue = 232|url = https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=b24eAAAAIBAJ&sjid=mskEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3571%2C5262217|accessdate = 17 December 2015}}</ref> His mother was left to raise five children by herself. Student body president and a four-sport athlete, Brady graduated from Rapid City Central High School, in 1973. Working his way through college holding a variety of jobs—construction worker, meat packer, manufacturing worker, waiter, and bartender, Brady earned a degree in mass communications from the [[University of South Dakota]] in Vermillion,<ref>http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/elections/2004/candidates/22038/</ref> where he played varsity baseball, served in the student government association and became a member of the [[Lambda Chi Alpha]] fraternity. In 2005, he was named a distinguished alumnus of the university, and in 2001, was a recipient of the order of achievement by the national Lambda Chi Alpha organization.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

A chamber of commerce executive at the Rapid City area chamber of commerce, Brady was elected to the Rapid City common council, at age 26. In 1982, he moved to Texas to work for the Beaumont chamber of commerce and later the south Montgomery county, Woodlands chamber of commerce.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Texas House of Representatives==
Brady began his Texas political career in 1990 when he was elected to the [[Texas House of Representatives]], representing The Woodlands, parts of Montgomery County, and five other counties west and north of Houston.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;1996
Incumbent Republican congressman [[Jack Fields]] of [[Texas' 8th congressional district]] decided to retire. Brady decided to run and ranked second in the Republican primary with 22% of the vote in a six candidate field. But the candidate who ranked first, Dr. Gene Fontenot, received just 36% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222672|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 - R Primary Race - Mar 12, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In the run-off election, Brady defeated him 53%–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222682|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 - R Runoff Race - Apr 09, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Bush v. Vera]]'' that three congressional districts in Texas were unconstitutional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-03-09/texas-redistricting-a-timeline/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303224441/http://www.austinchronicle.com/news/2012-03-09/texas-redistricting-a-timeline/|title=Texas Redistricting: A Timeline|archivedate=March 3, 2016|publisher=}}</ref> After holding hearings, the court concluded that there was no longer time to hold primaries and instead forced all candidates (Democrats and Republicans) be listed together on the November general election ballot in a [[jungle primary]]. If no candidate reached 50%, a special runoff would be held on December 10 between the two highest ranking candidates regardless of political party. In the November election, Brady ranked first with 41% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30056|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 Race - Nov 05, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In the December run-off election, he defeated Fontenot again 59%–41%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30083|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 - Runoff Race - Dec 10, 1996|publisher=}}</ref>

;2010–2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Texas, 2010#District 8}}
For the first time since 1998, Brady was challenged in the Republican primary. Three candidates filed against him. He defeated all of them in the March primary with 79% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=612091|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 08 - R Primary Race - Mar 02, 2010|publisher=}}</ref> He won re-election with 80% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=524824|title=Our Campaigns - TX - District 08 Race - Nov 02, 2010|publisher=}}</ref> In the May 2012, Republican primary in a newly-redrawn district he defeated his challenger with 76% of the vote. In the November 6, 2012 general election he defeated his Democratic opponent with over 77% of the vote.

In the Republican primary on March 4, Brady won re-nomination to a tenth term in the U.S. House.

===Tenure===
Brady serves as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]].

He has advocated lower taxes, deficit reduction and [[free trade]], and called for replacing the [[income tax (U.S.)|income tax]] with a [[national sales tax]].

As a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee he has chaired the trade sub-committee and, beginning this year, became chairman of the health sub-committee, which places him in the center of congressional debate on Medicare and health care law. He was also tapped to lead the energy working group as the committee pursued comprehensive tax reform in 2013.

In 2002, Rep. Brady voted in favor of the authorization of force against the nation of Iraq.

In 2004 he led the successful effort to restore the sales tax deduction, which had been eliminated in 1986. Brady has been a leader on free trade within Congress, serving as President George W. Bush's point man on the successful passage of the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central America Free Trade Agreement]] and the recent agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. However, he is best known as the author of a federal "[[sunset clause|sunset law]]" that would require every federal program not specifically written into the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/directory/kevin-brady/ |title=U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady |publisher=The Texas Tribune |date=November 4, 1955 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> He has introduced this bill at the beginning of every Congress. It was approved overwhelmingly by the House as an amendment in 2004 but did not progress further. In 2006 it passed the Government Reform Committee but did not reach a floor vote.

Brady is the chairman of the U.S. House-Senate joint economic committee, the third Texan to lead the committee, after Sen. [[Lloyd Bentsen]] and Rep. [[Wright Patman]]. Brady and his staff developed the "Organizational Chart of the House Democrats' Health Plan", the complex chart that showed the creation of at least 31 new federal agencies, commissions and mandates included in the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]]. He also called on former Treasury secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] to step down, citing rising unemployment, exaggerated stimulus job claims, unsustainable debt and "failed economic policies" of the Obama administration.

He introduced three major pieces of legislation: The MAP Act which would have shrank the size of the federal government, abolish obsolete agencies, establish a line item-veto for each president and permanently end the threat of a future government shutdown; the Sound Dollar Act which reformed the Federal Reserve and most the centennial monetary commission which would have created a bi-partisan commission to examine the Federal Reserve Bank's effectiveness and role over the first 100 years of existence and make legislative recommendations for its second century of existence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In March 2012, he proposed the ''Sound Dollar Act'', which requires the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to [[Gold standard|monitor gold]] and the [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange value]] of the [[U.S. Dollar]]. The bill would also replace the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of controlling unemployment and inflation with one mandate for U.S. Dollar [[price stability]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812060553/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow|title=King Dollar Will Cut Oil Prices  - National Review Online|author=Larry Kudlow|archivedate=August 12, 2014|work=National Review Online}}</ref>

Brady's district was hit hard by [[Hurricane Rita]] and again by [[Hurricane Ike]], and he has helped lead the Texas recovery effort in the House for both disasters.  In 2011, in the interim redistricting map approved by a San Antonio federal court, the 8th District lost seven counties in east and southeast Texas and gained all or part of six counties going north toward Dallas.

On November 4, 2015, Brady was elected the 65th chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]].<ref name="WalshCNN11042015">{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Deirdre |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/04/politics/kevin-brady-ways-and-means/ |title=Texas Republican Kevin Brady to be new Ways and Means chairman |work=CNN |location=Atlanta |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |date=2015-11-04 |accessdate=2016-01-21 }}</ref>

During his career in the U.S. House, Brady has earned a career Liberty Score of "F" from the ''[[Conservative Review]]'', an American media group that provides conservatives with information on politicians.<ref>[https://www.conservativereview.com/members/kevin-brady/ Member Profile - Kevin Brady], [[Conservative Review]].</ref>

He and his family did not move to Washington, D.C. and he continues to commute from Texas to work in Congress each week.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On October 7, 2005 Brady was arrested and charged with [[driving under the influence]] of alcohol while in South Dakota to accept a distinguished alumni award. He was returning from a reception with his mother, wife, sister, and brother-in-law in the car when he was pulled over for a non-working tail light. He faced a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail.  He pleaded [[no contest]].  Upon his misdemeanor conviction on November 8, he was fined $350, and his right to drive in South Dakota was suspended for 30 days.  Before his sentencing, Brady had stated that "no one is above the law" and he would accept "every consequence" of his actions, even if that meant a jail sentence.  "To me, regardless of how this turns out, what it says is that you don't get behind the wheel."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-10-11-drunk-congressman_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Texas Congressman Kevin Brady charged with DUI|publisher=}}</ref>

===Elections===
;1996
Incumbent Republican congressman [[Jack Fields]] of [[Texas' 8th congressional district]] decided to retire. Brady decided to run and ranked second in the Republican primary with 22% of the vote in a six candidate field. But the candidate who ranked first, Dr. Gene Fontenot, received just 36% of the vote, short of the 50% threshold.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222672|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 - R Primary Race - Mar 12, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In the run-off election, Brady defeated him 53%–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=222682|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 - R Runoff Race - Apr 09, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> However, the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ruled in ''[[Bush v.

If no candidate reached 50%, a special runoff would be held on December 10 between the two highest ranking candidates regardless of political party. In the November election, Brady ranked first with 41% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30056|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 Race - Nov 05, 1996|publisher=}}</ref> In the December run-off election, he defeated Fontenot again 59%–41%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=30083|title=Our Campaigns - TX District 8 - Runoff Race - Dec 10, 1996|publisher=}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Brady serves as chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]].

He has advocated lower taxes, deficit reduction and [[free trade]], and called for replacing the [[income tax (U.S.)|income tax]] with a [[national sales tax]].

As a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee he has chaired the trade sub-committee and, beginning this year, became chairman of the health sub-committee, which places him in the center of congressional debate on Medicare and health care law. He was also tapped to lead the energy working group as the committee pursued comprehensive tax reform in 2013.

In 2002, Rep. Brady voted in favor of the authorization of force against the nation of Iraq.

In 2004 he led the successful effort to restore the sales tax deduction, which had been eliminated in 1986. Brady has been a leader on free trade within Congress, serving as President George W. Bush's point man on the successful passage of the [[Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement|Central America Free Trade Agreement]] and the recent agreements with South Korea, Colombia, and Panama. However, he is best known as the author of a federal "[[sunset clause|sunset law]]" that would require every federal program not specifically written into the [[U.S. Constitution|Constitution]] to justify its existence to taxpayers within 12 years or face elimination.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/directory/kevin-brady/ |title=U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady |publisher=The Texas Tribune |date=November 4, 1955 |accessdate=August 29, 2010}}</ref> He has introduced this bill at the beginning of every Congress. It was approved overwhelmingly by the House as an amendment in 2004 but did not progress further. In 2006 it passed the Government Reform Committee but did not reach a floor vote.

Brady is the chairman of the U.S. House-Senate joint economic committee, the third Texan to lead the committee, after Sen. [[Lloyd Bentsen]] and Rep. [[Wright Patman]]. Brady and his staff developed the "Organizational Chart of the House Democrats' Health Plan", the complex chart that showed the creation of at least 31 new federal agencies, commissions and mandates included in the [[America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009]]. He also called on former Treasury secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] to step down, citing rising unemployment, exaggerated stimulus job claims, unsustainable debt and "failed economic policies" of the Obama administration.

He introduced three major pieces of legislation: The MAP Act which would have shrank the size of the federal government, abolish obsolete agencies, establish a line item-veto for each president and permanently end the threat of a future government shutdown; the Sound Dollar Act which reformed the Federal Reserve and most the centennial monetary commission which would have created a bi-partisan commission to examine the Federal Reserve Bank's effectiveness and role over the first 100 years of existence and make legislative recommendations for its second century of existence.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In March 2012, he proposed the ''Sound Dollar Act'', which requires the [[Federal Reserve System|Federal Reserve]] to [[Gold standard|monitor gold]] and the [[Foreign exchange market|foreign-exchange value]] of the [[U.S. Dollar]]. The bill would also replace the Federal Reserve’s dual mandate of controlling unemployment and inflation with one mandate for U.S. Dollar [[price stability]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812060553/http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/293730/king-dollar-will-cut-oil-prices-larry-kudlow|title=King Dollar Will Cut Oil Prices  - National Review Online|author=Larry Kudlow|archivedate=August 12, 2014|work=National Review Online}}</ref>

Brady's district was hit hard by [[Hurricane Rita]] and again by [[Hurricane Ike]], and he has helped lead the Texas recovery effort in the House for both disasters.  In 2011, in the interim redistricting map approved by a San Antonio federal court, the 8th District lost seven counties in east and southeast Texas and gained all or part of six counties going north toward Dallas.

On November 4, 2015, Brady was elected the 65th chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Committee on Ways and Means]].<ref name="WalshCNN11042015">{{cite news |last=Walsh |first=Deirdre |url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/11/04/politics/kevin-brady-ways-and-means/ |title=Texas Republican Kevin Brady to be new Ways and Means chairman |work=CNN |location=Atlanta |publisher=Turner Broadcasting System |date=2015-11-04 |accessdate=2016-01-21 }}</ref>

He and his family did not move to Washington, D.C. and he continues to commute from Texas to work in Congress each week.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

On October 7, 2005 Brady was arrested and charged with [[driving under the influence]] of alcohol while in South Dakota to accept a distinguished alumni award. He was returning from a reception with his mother, wife, sister, and brother-in-law in the car when he was pulled over for a non-working tail light. He faced a fine of up to $1,000 and a year in jail.  He pleaded [[no contest]].  Upon his misdemeanor conviction on November 8, he was fined $350, and his right to drive in South Dakota was suspended for 30 days.  Before his sentencing, Brady had stated that "no one is above the law" and he would accept "every consequence" of his actions, even if that meant a jail sentence.  "To me, regardless of how this turns out, what it says is that you don't get behind the wheel."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/nation/2005-10-11-drunk-congressman_x.htm|title=USATODAY.com - Texas Congressman Kevin Brady charged with DUI|publisher=}}</ref>
