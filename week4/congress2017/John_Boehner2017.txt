Boehner previously served as the [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] from 2007 until 2011, and [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] from 2006 until 2007. Boehner's almost nine years as the Republican Leader in the House (four years as Minority Leader and nearly five years as Speaker) was the longest consecutive tenure for a Republican Leader in the House since [[Robert H. Michel|Bob Michel]] of Illinois served 14 years as House Minority Leader from 1981 through 1995. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican caucus.

In September 2016, [[Squire Patton Boggs]], the third-largest lobbying firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. Also, Boehner will become a board member of [[Reynolds American]], the second biggest tobacco firm in the U.S., for an estimated annual salary of $400,000.<ref>http://fortune.com/2016/09/20/john-boehner-squire-patton-boggs/</ref>

==Early life, education, and career==
Boehner was born in [[Reading, Ohio]], the son of Mary Anne (née Hall; 1926-1998) and Earl Henry Boehner (1925-1990), the second of twelve children. His father was of [[German American|German]] descent and his mother had German and [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8009943/John-Boehner-the-second-of-12-kids-from-Ohio-who-is-Barack-Obamas-elitist-target.html |title=John Boehner: the second of twelve kids |work=The Daily Telegraph  |accessdate=September 14, 2010 | location=London | first=Toby | last=Harnden}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=175380149169318&set=a.175380095835990.35084.175082565865743 |title=Office of Speaker Boehner's Photos – January 2011 |publisher=Facebook}}</ref><ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://johnboehner.house.gov/Biography |title=John Boehner – 8th District of Ohio |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=July 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513191556/http://johnboehner.house.gov/Biography/ |archivedate=May 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson |first=Clifford |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yZnDW7PT4QC&q=%22Earl+Henry+Boehner%22+HALL&dq=%22Earl+Henry+Boehner%22+HALL&hl=en |title=Current Biography Yearbook 2006 |year=2006 |publisher=H.W.

Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and [[plastics industry]]. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.<ref name="bio"/>

==Early political career==
From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of [[Union Township, Butler County, Ohio]]. He then served as an [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio state representative]] from 1985 to 1990.<ref>[http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9538 Boehner, John Andrew]. US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives. Retrieved March 16, 2015.</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor.  He defeated Lukens in the primary, taking 49 percent of the vote, and then handily beat his Democratic opponent, [[Greg Jolivette]], in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1990|November election]].  He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times, each by a substantial margin.

===Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America''===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], New York Times, Carl Hulse, July 4, 2009</ref> Later, he, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

===Republican leadership===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]] which is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives.  In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]]. During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160}}</ref>

In 1998, Boehner was ousted as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, after his party lost five congressional seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020201046.html |title=In an Upset, Boehner Is Elected House GOP Leader |work=The Washington Post |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2010 | location=Washington | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]] from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news |author=George F.

===House Republican Leader===
[[File:John Boehner portrait.jpg|thumb|right|2006 portrait of Boehner]]

In an upset, Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader on February 2, 2006.  The election followed [[Tom DeLay]]'s resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]] and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as [[Majority Whip]], the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call |accessdate=2006-02-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204102043/http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref> due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]], as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918155340/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

==Speaker of the House==

The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about "economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream".<ref name="Time"/> November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=215305 |title=Boehner: New Leadership "Reflects a New Majority Ready to Listen and Go to Work |publisher=Office of the House Republican Leader |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122033220/http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=215305 |archivedate=November 22, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/129727-boehner-elected-61st-speaker-of-the-house-on-his-61st-birthday|title=Boehner favored as 61st House Speaker on his 61st birthday |publisher=TheHill.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011.

Boehner appeared on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]'' on January 23, 2014. When asked by Leno if he would ever run for president, the Speaker said no, adding, "I like to play golf. I like to cut my own grass. I do drink red wine, I smoke cigarettes.

[[File:Speaker's Farewell.tif|thumb|300px|Speaker Boehner looks at the National Mall from the Speaker's balcony at the U.S. Capitol for one of the final times before leaving office]]
On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after [[Pope Francis|Pope Francis']] [[Pope Francis' visit to the United States|address to Congress the day before]], an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.  Conservative opposition to funding [[Planned Parenthood]] as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement.<ref name="resign1">{{cite news|title=John Boehner Will Resign From Congress|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/boehner-will-resign-from-congress.html|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> Originally, House Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] of California had announced he would run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite. On October 8, 2015, McCarthy abruptly announced he would not run for Speaker, citing that he felt he could not effectively lead a fractured Republican Caucus. After McCarthy's announcement, Boehner announced that would stay on as Speaker until a successor was chosen.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/10/08/house-majority-leader-kevin-mccarthy-drops-out-of-race-for-house-speaker/ |title=House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy drops out of race for House speaker |work=Washington Post |authors=Mike DeBonis, Robert Costa and Rosalind S.

==Controversies==
{{criticism section|date=June 2015}}

===Connections to lobbyists===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dana Milbank |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."<ref>{{Citation

A September 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation’s biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J. Reynolds, MillerCoors and UPS.".<ref>{{Cite news |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2010/09/12/us/politics/12boehner.html?pagewanted=all |title=A G.O.P.

===Smithsonian===
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it. Boehner spokesman Kevin Smith said, "Smithsonian officials should either acknowledge the mistake and correct it, or be prepared to face tough scrutiny beginning in January when the new majority in the House moves [in]."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/30/AR2010113006801.html | work=The Washington Post | first=Jacqueline | last=Trescott | title=Portrait Gallery removes crucifix video from exhibit after complaints | date=December 1, 2010}}</ref>

===Hurricane Sandy relief bill===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the house without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]]. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] harshly criticized Boehner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/chris-christie-slams-john-boehner-hurricane-sandy-presser-18120271|title=Gov.

===Cromnibus and 2015 House Chair election===
Many [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] were ready for a new [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] Chairman following the 2014 mid-term elections.

==Political positions==
[[Image:JBoehnerandbush.JPG|thumb|Boehner introducing then-president [[George W. Bush]] in [[Troy, Ohio]] in 2003]]

According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'': "From [[illegal immigration]] to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021100842.html |title=Washington Post |work=Washington Post |date= February 12, 2006|accessdate=June 14, 2010 | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Boehner opposes [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], as evidenced by his vote for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in both 2004 and 2006.  In a letter to the [[Human Rights Campaign]], Boehner stated, "I oppose any legislation that would provide special [[LGBT rights by country or territory|rights for homosexuals]]...

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."

===Financial crisis===
On September 18, 2008, Congressman Boehner attended a closed meeting with congressional leaders, then-Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke, and was urged to craft legislation to help financially troubled banks.

Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President [[Barack Obama]], including the "[[cap and trade]]" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act. One option would be to defund the administrative aspect of the Act, not paying "one dime" to pay the salaries of the workers who would administer the plan.<ref name="Wereschagin"/> He also led an opposition to the 2009 stimulus and to Obama's first budget proposal, promoting instead an alternative economic recovery plan<ref>{{cite web|url=http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |title=House GOP Economic Recovery Alternative Will Create 6.2 Million New American Jobs &#124; Republican Leader John Boehner |publisher=Republicanleader.house.gov |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100608232152/http://republicanleader.house.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=109659 |archivedate=June 8, 2010 }}</ref> and a Republican budget (authored by Ranking Rep.

==Post-speakership==

===Politics===
Boehner made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Presidential Candidate [[Ted Cruz]] as "[[Lucifer]] in the flesh" in an interview at [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Kristina|title=John Boehner Calls Ted Cruz ‘Lucifer in the Flesh’|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/28/john-boehner-calls-ted-cruz-lucifer-in-the-flesh/|accessdate=28 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=28 April 2016}}</ref> On May 12, after [[Donald Trump]] became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner's support for him became public, though he distanced himself on several policies and expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination: "Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/john-boehner-backs-donald-trump/|date=May 12, 2016|publisher=CNN|title=John Boehner backs Donald Trump, thanks God Cruz didn't win|first=Phil|last=Mattingly}}</ref>

===Business===

Boener joined the board of tobacco company [[Reynolds American]] on September 15, 2016.<ref>http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/15/investing/john-boehner-smoking-joins-tobacco-company/</ref>

==Legacy==
In reporting his pending retirement, [[Politico]] summarized his Speakership:
:Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.<ref>Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, John Bresnahan and Lauren French, "Speaker John Boehner retiring from Congress at the end of October" [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/speaker-john-boehner-retiring-from-congress-at-the-end-of-october-214056#ixzz3mlVEHpBf ''POLITICO'' Sept. 25, 2015]</ref>

Paul Kane in the ''Washington Post'' emphasizes how none of the "big deals" he sought were ever reached:
:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.<ref>Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the ‘big deal’ he wanted" [http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-nearly-five-years-boehner-could-never-land-the-big-deal-he-wanted/2015/09/25/6bf22bd2-63b3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html ''Washington Post'' Sept 25, 2015]</ref>

Furthermore, Kane argues,  Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, "a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner’s easygoing style did not fit."<ref>Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the ‘big deal’ he wanted"</ref>

==Personal life==
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the [[Wetherington, Ohio|Wetherington]] section of [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester Township]]. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.<ref>{{cite journal|author=James Rowley |date=October 28, 2010 |title=Boehner’s Blue-Collar Roots Frame Possible Next Speaker’s Views |journal=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628225642/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 }}</ref>

The district included several rural and suburban areas near [[Cincinnati]] and [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]].

Boehner previously served as the [[Minority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Minority Leader]] from 2007 until 2011, and [[Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] from 2006 until 2007. Boehner's almost nine years as the Republican Leader in the House (four years as Minority Leader and nearly five years as Speaker) was the longest consecutive tenure for a Republican Leader in the House since [[Robert H. Michel|Bob Michel]] of Illinois served 14 years as House Minority Leader from 1981 through 1995. Boehner resigned from the House of Representatives in October 2015 due to opposition from within the Republican caucus.

In September 2016, [[Squire Patton Boggs]], the third-largest lobbying firm in the U.S., announced that Boehner would join their firm. Also, Boehner will become a board member of [[Reynolds American]], the second biggest tobacco firm in the U.S., for an estimated annual salary of $400,000.<ref>http://fortune.com/2016/09/20/john-boehner-squire-patton-boggs/</ref>

==Early life, education, and career==
Boehner was born in [[Reading, Ohio]], the son of Mary Anne (née Hall; 1926-1998) and Earl Henry Boehner (1925-1990), the second of twelve children. His father was of [[German American|German]] descent and his mother had German and [[Irish American|Irish]] ancestry.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/8009943/John-Boehner-the-second-of-12-kids-from-Ohio-who-is-Barack-Obamas-elitist-target.html |title=John Boehner: the second of twelve kids |work=The Daily Telegraph  |accessdate=September 14, 2010 | location=London | first=Toby | last=Harnden}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.facebook.com/photo.php?fbid=175380149169318&set=a.175380095835990.35084.175082565865743 |title=Office of Speaker Boehner's Photos – January 2011 |publisher=Facebook}}</ref><ref name="bio">{{cite web|url=http://johnboehner.house.gov/Biography |title=John Boehner – 8th District of Ohio |publisher=U.S. House of Representatives |accessdate=July 13, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090513191556/http://johnboehner.house.gov/Biography/ |archivedate=May 13, 2009 }}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson |first=Clifford |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4yZnDW7PT4QC&q=%22Earl+Henry+Boehner%22+HALL&dq=%22Earl+Henry+Boehner%22+HALL&hl=en |title=Current Biography Yearbook 2006 |year=2006 |publisher=H.W.

Shortly after his graduation in 1977, Boehner accepted a position with Nucite Sales, a small sales business in the packaging and [[plastics industry]]. He was steadily promoted and eventually became president of the firm, resigning in 1990 when he was elected to Congress.<ref name="bio"/>

==Early political career==
From 1981 to 1984, Boehner served on the board of trustees of [[Union Township, Butler County, Ohio]]. He then served as an [[Ohio House of Representatives|Ohio state representative]] from 1985 to 1990.<ref>[http://history.house.gov/People/Detail/9538 Boehner, John Andrew]. US House of Representatives: History, Art & Archives. Retrieved March 16, 2015.</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1990, Boehner ran against incumbent congressman [[Buz Lukens]], who was under fire for having a sexual relationship with a minor.  He defeated Lukens in the primary, taking 49 percent of the vote, and then handily beat his Democratic opponent, [[Greg Jolivette]], in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1990|November election]].  He was subsequently re-elected to Congress 12 times, each by a substantial margin.

===Gang of Seven and ''Contract with America''===
During his freshman year, Boehner was a member of the [[Gang of Seven]] which was involved in bringing media attention to the [[House banking scandal]].<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/05/us/politics/05boehner.html A Rabble-Rouser, Then and Now], New York Times, Carl Hulse, July 4, 2009</ref> Later, he, along with [[Newt Gingrich]] and several other Republican lawmakers, was one of the engineers of the ''[[Contract with America]]'' in 1994 that politically helped Republicans during the 1994 congressional elections during which they won the majority in Congress for the first time in four decades.

===Republican leadership===
From 1995 to 1999, Boehner served as [[Republican Conference Chairman of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference Chairman]] which is the party caucus for Republicans in the United States House of Representatives.  In this post, he was the fourth-ranking House Republican, behind Gingrich, [[House Majority Leader|Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]] and [[House Majority Whip|Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]]. During his time as Conference Chairman, Boehner championed the [[Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996|Freedom to Farm Act]] that, among other provisions, revised and simplified direct payment programs for crops and eliminated milk price supports through direct government purchases.

In the summer of 1997 several House Republicans, who saw [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Newt Gingrich]]'s public image as a liability, attempted to replace him as Speaker. The attempted "coup" began July 9 with a meeting between Republican conference chairman Boehner and Republican leadership chairman [[Bill Paxon]] of New York. According to their plan, [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Leader]] [[Dick Armey]], [[Party whips of the United States House of Representatives|House Majority Whip]] [[Tom DeLay]], Boehner and Paxon were to present Gingrich with an ultimatum: resign, or be voted out. However, Armey balked at the proposal to make Paxon the new Speaker, and told his chief of staff to warn Gingrich about the coup.<ref>{{Cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/ALLPOLITICS/1997/07/21/time/gingrich.html |publisher=CNN|title=Attempted Republican Coup: Ready, Aim, Misfire|accessdate=May 20, 2010}}</ref>

On July 11, Gingrich met with senior Republican leadership to assess the situation. He explained that under no circumstance would he step down. If he was voted out, there would be a new election for Speaker, which would allow for the possibility that Democrats—along with dissenting Republicans—would vote in [[Dick Gephardt]] as Speaker. On July 16, Paxon offered to resign his post, feeling that he had not handled the situation correctly. Paxon was the only unelected member of the leadership group, having been appointed to his position by Gingrich.<ref>{{cite book |title=Lessons Learned the Hard Way |last=Gingrich |first=Newt |year=1998 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishers |isbn=978-0-06-019106-1 |pages=159–160}}</ref>

In 1998, Boehner was ousted as the chairman of the House Republican Conference, after his party lost five congressional seats.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020201046.html |title=In an Upset, Boehner Is Elected House GOP Leader |work=The Washington Post |date=March 2, 2006 |accessdate=November 4, 2010 | location=Washington | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Following the election of President [[George W. Bush]], Boehner was elected as chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Education and the Workforce Committee]] from 2001 until 2006. There he authored several reforms including the [[Pension Protection Act of 2006|Pension Protection Act]] and a successful school choice voucher program for low-income children in Washington, DC.<ref>{{cite news |author=George F.

Boehner and Senator [[Ted Kennedy]] authored the passage of the [[No Child Left Behind Act of 2001]], which was signed by President George W.

===House Republican Leader===
[[File:John Boehner portrait.jpg|thumb|right|2006 portrait of Boehner]]

In an upset, Boehner was elected by his colleagues to serve as House Majority Leader on February 2, 2006.  The election followed [[Tom DeLay]]'s resignation from the post after being indicted on criminal charges. Boehner campaigned as a reform candidate who wanted to reform the so-called "[[Earmark (politics)|earmark]]" process and rein in government spending. He defeated Majority Whip [[Roy Blunt]] of [[Missouri]] and Representative [[John Shadegg]] of [[Arizona]], even though he was considered an underdog candidate to Blunt. In the second round of voting by the House Republican Conference, Boehner defeated Blunt with 122 to 109 votes. Blunt kept his previous position as [[Majority Whip]], the No. 3 leadership position in the House. (There was some confusion on the first ballot for Majority Leader as the first count showed one more vote cast than Republicans present,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |title=Roll Call |accessdate=2006-02-04 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204102043/http://rollcall.com/issues/1_1/breakingnews/12015-1.html |archivedate=February 4, 2006 |df=mdy }}</ref> due to a misunderstanding as to whether the rules allowed Resident Commissioner [[Luis Fortuño]] of Puerto Rico to vote).<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0602/02/lol.01.html |title=CNN |publisher=CNN |date=February 2, 2006 |accessdate=June 14, 2010}}</ref>

After the Republicans lost control of the House in the 2006 elections, the House Republican Conference chose Boehner as Minority Leader.  While as Majority Leader he was second-in-command behind Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]], as Minority Leader he was the leader of the House Republicans. As such, he was the Republican nominee for Speaker in 2006 and 2008, losing both times to Pelosi.

According to the 2008 Congress.org Power Ranking, Boehner was the 6th most powerful congressman (preceded by Speaker Pelosi, Majority Leader Hoyer, Ways and Means Committee Chairman [[Sander M. Levin]], Dean of the House [[John Dingell]], and Appropriations Committee Chairman [[Dave Obey]], all Democrats) and the most powerful Republican.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-04-25 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918155340/http://www.congress.org/congressorg/power_rankings/overall.tt |archivedate=September 18, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref> As Minority Leader, Boehner served as an ''ex officio'' member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]].

==Speaker of the House==

The Republicans won a majority in the House of Representatives during the 2010 midterm elections, with a net gain of 63 seats. During his solemn victory speech, Boehner broke into tears when talking about "economic freedom, individual liberty and personal responsibility...I hold these values dear because I've lived them...I've spent my whole life chasing the American Dream".<ref name="Time"/> November 17, 2010, Boehner was unanimously chosen by the House Republicans as their nominee for Speaker,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=215305 |title=Boehner: New Leadership "Reflects a New Majority Ready to Listen and Go to Work |publisher=Office of the House Republican Leader |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122033220/http://gopleader.gov/News/DocumentSingle.aspx?DocumentID=215305 |archivedate=November 22, 2010 }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/129727-boehner-elected-61st-speaker-of-the-house-on-his-61st-birthday|title=Boehner favored as 61st House Speaker on his 61st birthday |publisher=TheHill.com |date=November 17, 2010 |accessdate=November 17, 2010}}</ref> all but assuring his formal election to the post when the new Congress convened with a Republican majority in January 2011.

As Speaker, he was still the leader of the House Republicans.

[[File:Speaker's Farewell.tif|thumb|300px|Speaker Boehner looks at the National Mall from the Speaker's balcony at the U.S. Capitol for one of the final times before leaving office]]
On September 25, 2015, Boehner announced that he would step down as Speaker and resign from Congress at the end of October 2015. Boehner's resignation took place after [[Pope Francis|Pope Francis']] [[Pope Francis' visit to the United States|address to Congress the day before]], an event considered by Boehner personally as the highest point in his legislative career. Sources in his office indicated he was stepping aside in the face of increasing discord while trying to manage passage of a continuing resolution to fund the government.  Conservative opposition to funding [[Planned Parenthood]] as part of the resolution, and stronger threats to Boehner's leadership on account of the controversy, prompted the abrupt announcement.<ref name="resign1">{{cite news|title=John Boehner Will Resign From Congress|first=Jennifer |last=Steinhauer |work=[[The New York Times]]|url=http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/us/boehner-will-resign-from-congress.html|date=September 25, 2015|accessdate=October 8, 2015}}</ref> Originally, House Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] of California had announced he would run for Speaker and was seen as the prohibitive favorite.

==Controversies==
{{criticism section|date=June 2015}}

===Connections to lobbyists===
In June 1995, Boehner distributed campaign contributions from [[tobacco industry]] [[lobbyist]]s on the House floor as House members were weighing how to vote on tobacco subsidies.<ref>{{cite news|author=Dana Milbank |url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/02/AR2006020202571_pf.html |title=Boehner Makes His Political Comeback |work=Washington Post |date=February 3, 2006 |accessdate=November 22, 2010}}</ref> In a 1996 documentary by [[PBS]] called ''The People and the Power Game'', Boehner said "They asked me to give out a half dozen checks quickly before we got to the end of the month and I complied. And I did it on the House floor, which I regret. I should not have done. It's not a violation of the House rules, but it's a practice that‘s gone on here for a long time that we're trying to stop and I know I'll never do it again."<ref>{{Citation

A September 2010 ''[[New York Times]]'' story said Boehner was "Tightly Bound to Lobbyists" and "He maintains especially tight ties with a circle of lobbyists and former aides representing some of the nation’s biggest businesses, including Goldman Sachs, Google, Citigroup, R.J.

===Smithsonian===
In November 2010, Boehner, along with Minority Whip Eric Cantor, called for the cancellation of an exhibit in the [[Smithsonian]]'s [[National Portrait Gallery (United States)|National Portrait Gallery]] after he learned that it featured a video by [[David Wojnarowicz]], ''A Fire in My Belly'', that contained an image of a [[crucifix]] with ants crawling on it.

===Hurricane Sandy relief bill===
On January 1, 2013, after passing the [[fiscal cliff]] [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|deal]], Boehner adjourned the house without passing the $60 million [[Hurricane Sandy relief bill]]. Some Representatives, especially from the Northeast and including Republicans as well as Democrats, and [[New Jersey]] Governor [[Chris Christie]] harshly criticized Boehner.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/video/chris-christie-slams-john-boehner-hurricane-sandy-presser-18120271|title=Gov.

According to the ''[[Washington Post]]'': "From [[illegal immigration]] to sanctions on China to an overhaul of the pension system, Boehner, as chairman of the House Committee on Education and the Workforce, took ardently pro-business positions that were contrary to those of many in his party. Religious conservatives – examining his voting record – see him as a policymaker driven by small-government economic concerns, not theirs."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/11/AR2006021100842.html |title=Washington Post |work=Washington Post |date= February 12, 2006|accessdate=June 14, 2010 | first=Jonathan | last=Weisman}}</ref>

Boehner opposes [[same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], as evidenced by his vote for the [[Federal Marriage Amendment]] in both 2004 and 2006.

On May 25, 2006, Boehner issued a statement defending his agenda and attacking his "[[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] friends" such as Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Boehner said regarding national security that voters "have a choice between a Republican Party that understands the stakes and is dedicated to victory, and a Democrat Party with a non-existent national security policy that sheepishly dismisses the challenges of a post-[[9/11]] world and is all too willing to concede defeat on the battlefield in [[Iraq]]."

Boehner has been highly critical of several initiatives by the Democratic Congress and President [[Barack Obama]], including the "[[cap and trade]]" plan that Boehner says would hurt job growth in his congressional district and elsewhere. He opposed the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] and said that, if Republicans took control of the House of Representatives in the 2010 elections, they would do whatever it takes to stop the act.

==Post-speakership==

===Politics===
Boehner made headlines in April 2016 when he referred to [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Presidential Candidate [[Ted Cruz]] as "[[Lucifer]] in the flesh" in an interview at [[Stanford University]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peterson|first1=Kristina|title=John Boehner Calls Ted Cruz ‘Lucifer in the Flesh’|url=http://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2016/04/28/john-boehner-calls-ted-cruz-lucifer-in-the-flesh/|accessdate=28 April 2016|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=28 April 2016}}</ref> On May 12, after [[Donald Trump]] became the presumptive Republican nominee, Boehner's support for him became public, though he distanced himself on several policies and expressed satisfaction with Cruz not securing the nomination: "Thank God the guy from Texas didn't win."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/12/politics/john-boehner-backs-donald-trump/|date=May 12, 2016|publisher=CNN|title=John Boehner backs Donald Trump, thanks God Cruz didn't win|first=Phil|last=Mattingly}}</ref>

===Business===

Boener joined the board of tobacco company [[Reynolds American]] on September 15, 2016.<ref>http://money.cnn.com/2016/09/15/investing/john-boehner-smoking-joins-tobacco-company/</ref>

==Legacy==
In reporting his pending retirement, [[Politico]] summarized his Speakership:
:Boehner came into power on the momentum of the 2010 tea party wave. But it was that movement that gave him constant problems. He clashed with [[Social conservatism|social conservatives]] over the debt limit, government funding, Obamacare and taxes. But his tenure will also be remembered for his complicated relationship with President Barack Obama. He and Obama tried — but repeatedly failed — to cut a deal on a sweeping fiscal agreement. But Boehner has had some significant victories, including the trade deal that Congress passed this year, and changes to entitlement programs.<ref>Jake Sherman, Anna Palmer, John Bresnahan and Lauren French, "Speaker John Boehner retiring from Congress at the end of October" [http://www.politico.com/story/2015/09/speaker-john-boehner-retiring-from-congress-at-the-end-of-october-214056#ixzz3mlVEHpBf ''POLITICO'' Sept. 25, 2015]</ref>

Paul Kane in the ''Washington Post'' emphasizes how none of the "big deals" he sought were ever reached:
:Boehner never landed the really big deal he craved. Not the $4 trillion tax-and-entitlement deal he reached for in 2011, not the repackaged version a year later and not the immigration overhaul he sought in 2014.<ref>Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the ‘big deal’ he wanted" [http://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/after-nearly-five-years-boehner-could-never-land-the-big-deal-he-wanted/2015/09/25/6bf22bd2-63b3-11e5-b38e-06883aacba64_story.html ''Washington Post'' Sept 25, 2015]</ref>

Furthermore, Kane argues,  Boehner's persona alienated conservative Republicans who demanded more vigorous attacks on Obama and instead perceived, "a country club Republican who loved to play 18 holes of golf and drink merlot afterward while cutting deals. In an era of shouting and confrontation, on talk radio or cable TV, Boehner’s easygoing style did not fit."<ref>Paul Kane, "After nearly five years, Boehner could never land the ‘big deal’ he wanted"</ref>

==Personal life==
Boehner and his wife Debbie were married in 1973, and live in the [[Wetherington, Ohio|Wetherington]] section of [[West Chester Township, Butler County, Ohio|West Chester Township]]. They have two daughters, Lindsay and Tricia.<ref>{{cite journal|author=James Rowley |date=October 28, 2010 |title=Boehner’s Blue-Collar Roots Frame Possible Next Speaker’s Views |journal=Business Week |publisher=Bloomberg L.P. |location=New York, NY |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |accessdate=November 22, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628225642/http://www.businessweek.com/news/2010-10-28/boehner-s-blue-collar-roots-frame-possible-next-speaker-s-views.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 }}</ref>
