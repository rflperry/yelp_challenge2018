'''Cedric Levon Richmond'''<ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/54388.html?SITE=NPRELN&SECTION=PREELECTION&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT]</ref> (born September 13, 1973) is an [[United States|American]] politician in the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[Louisiana]]'s [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district|2nd congressional district]] since 2011. His district includes most of [[New Orleans]].

==Early life and education==
He was raised in [[Eastern New Orleans]], going to public schools. Richmond's father died when he was seven years old. His mother was a public school teacher and small business owner. Richmond graduated from [[Benjamin Franklin High School (New Orleans, Louisiana)|Benjamin Franklin High School]], [[Morehouse College]], [[Tulane School of Law]] and the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard University executive program at the John F. Kennedy School of Government]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cedricrichmond.com/about-cedric |title=Meet Cedric Richmond &#124; Cedric Richmond for Congress - Louisiana 2nd District |publisher=Cedricrichmond.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>

He was the [[Louisiana House of Representatives|Louisiana State Representative]] for District 101 ([[Orleans Parish]]) from 2000 to 2011.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.wbrz.com/news/voters-pick-bishop-mills-in-legis-races/ |title=Voters pick Bishop, Mills in legis races &#124; WBRZ News 2 Louisiana : Baton Rouge, LA &#124; |publisher=Wbrz.com |date=2011-01-23 |accessdate=2014-08-18}}</ref>  Having been first elected shortly after his 27th birthday, at the time he took office he became one of the youngest legislators ever to serve in Louisiana. He served as the Chairman of the Committee on Judiciary and a member of the Ways and Means, House Executive, and Legislative Audit Advisory committees.<ref name="about">{{cite web|url=http://www.cedricrichmond.com/about-cedric|title=About Cedric|publisher=cedricrichmond.com|accessdate=January 11, 2011}}</ref>

In an across-the-aisle gesture which was rare in Congress at the time, Richmond in 2014 defended his [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] colleague [[Vance McAllister]], who had become embroiled in an alleged adultery scandal. Richmond associated the controversy with "gotcha moments" in which the "two parties in this country have gone overboard...and taken joy in the pain of their supposed opponents".<ref>{{cite news

On June 9, 2014, Richmond introduced the [[Honor Flight Act (H.R. 4812; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[Transportation Security Administration]] (TSA) to establish a process for providing expedited and dignified [[Transportation Security Administration#Screening processes and regulations|passenger screening services]] for [[veterans]] traveling on an [[Honor Flight]] to visit [[war memorials]] built and dedicated to honor their service.<ref name=4812sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4812 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4812|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=9 July 2014}}</ref>

Until his election in 2015 to the Louisiana House of Representative, Richmond's special projects director was the African-American Democrat [[Jimmy Harris (Louisiana politician)|Jimmy Harris]], a New Orleans lawyer.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://myemail.constantcontact.com/James--Jimmy--Harris--III-Announces-Candidacy-For-Louisiana-House-of-Representatives--District-99.html?soid=1011087220895&aid=Jk1MqmxYxPg|date=August 12, 2015|publisher=myemail.constantcontact.com|title=James "Jimmy" Harris, III, Announces Candidacy For Louisiana House of Representatives, District 99|accessdate=April 6, 2016}}</ref>

On November 30, 2016, Richmond was elected to chair the [[Congressional Black Caucus]] in the [[115th United States Congress]].<ref>{{cite news|last=Rainey|first=Richard|title=Cedric Richmond elected chair of Congressional Black Caucus|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=November 30, 2016|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/11/cedric_richmond_elected_chair.html|accessdate=November 30, 2016}}</ref>

Richmond came in third place in the seven-candidate primary election for the Democratic nomination for [[Louisiana's 2nd congressional district]], behind U.S. Representative [[William J. Jefferson]] and television newscaster [[Helena Moreno]]. During a primary debate, Richmond attempted to discredit Moreno with accusations of drug use, while she attempted to attack his personal integrity by bringing up his disqualification from the 2005 New Orleans City Council "D" District election.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donze|first=Frank|title=Moreno, Richmond trade barbs at 2nd District talk|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=September 26, 2008|url=http://www.nola.com/news/index.ssf/2008/09/moreno_richmond_trade_barbs_at.html|accessdate=October 12, 2010}}</ref> Later in 2008, Richmond's law license was suspended for 6 months by the State Supreme Court in a 5–2 decision after it was found that he falsified a sworn statement claiming greater than 2 years residency in New Orleans' "D" District in order to be eligible for the district's City Council position.<ref>{{cite news|last=Donze|first=Frank|title=State Rep.

Richmond challenged Republican incumbent [[Joseph Cao|Anh “Joseph” Cao]] for {{ushr|LA|2}}.

Richmond was the first candidate in the 2010 elections to have President [[Barack Obama]] appear in a television ad on his behalf.<ref>{{cite news|last=Burns|first=Alexander|title=La.'s Richmond gets Obama's 1st ad|url=http://www.politico.com/politico44/perm/1010/big_easy_pitch_97e78eff-3743-4040-834b-fe0474415f37.html|accessdate=October 4, 2010|newspaper=Politico|date=October 4, 2010}}</ref>

Most pundits reckoned Richmond as a heavy favorite to retake the seat for the Democrats, even in what was forecast to be a Republican year nationally. With a [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] of D+25, the 2nd was far and away the most Democratic district in the country to be represented by a Republican. The next most Democratic district on that list, [[Delaware's At-large congressional district]], had a PVI of D+7. In 2008 Obama had carried the 2nd with a 74 percent of the vote, his fifth-best performance in a Southern district and his 35th best nationally.

Richmond won the November 2, 2010 election in the heavily Democratic [[majority-minority district]] with 65 percent of the vote.<ref name="Krupa">{{cite news|last1=Krupa|first1=Michelle|last2=Donze|first2=Frank|title=Cedric Richmond wins 2nd District House race; Joseph Cao concedes|publisher=''The Times-Picayune''|date=November 2, 2010|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2010/11/cedric_richmond_wins_anh_josep.html|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}</ref>
