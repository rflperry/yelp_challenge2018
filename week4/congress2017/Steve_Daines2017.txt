Daines emphasized his desire "to rise above partisan politics, preserve the prestine landscape, and 'protect this critical watershed'," when he announced that he would be introducing the bill.<ref name="MissoulianScott1"/>  According to Daines, both conservationists and energy companies support the bill.<ref name="MissoulianScott1"/> The bill, also supported by Tester and Walsh, passed in the House; but Senate Republicans prevented it from being voted on, killing it in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web|last=Scott|first=Tristan|url=http://www.flatheadbeacon.com/articles/article/north_fork_watershed_protection_act_passes_u.s._house/38154|title=North Fork Watershed Protection Act Passes U.S. House|work=Flathead Beacon|date=March 4, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Walsh|first=John|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/861626/walsh-disappointed-that-senate-fails-to-pass-landmark-conservation-bill-to-protect-north-fork#.U5GybfmwI7s|title=Walsh Disappointed that Senate Fails to Pass Landmark Conservation Bill to Protect North Fork|work=votesmart.org|date=April 3, 2014|accessdate=June 6, 2014}}</ref>
