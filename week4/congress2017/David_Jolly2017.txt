==Elections==

===2014 special election===
On January 14, 2014, Jolly won the Republican nomination over [[Mark Bircher]] and [[Kathleen Peters]], winning a plurality of 45% of the vote.<ref name=AP/> Jolly faced Democratic nominee [[Alex Sink]]  and a libertarian candidate, Lucas Overby, in the special election.  The race received national attention as possibly forecasting the mid-term elections that were coming in November of that year and became the most expensive Congressional race in history, with around $11M spent, $9M of it by outside groups.<ref name=TBOwinst1st/> During the campaign there was friction between the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] and Jolly; the RNC thought Jolly's campaign was inept, and Jolly criticized the negative ads run by the RNC.<ref name="Isenstadt">{{cite web|last=Isenstadt|first=Alex|title=National GOP turns on Florida candidate|publisher=Politico.com|date=March 7, 2014|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/03/david-jolly-alex-sink-florida-special-election-2014-104397.html#ixzz2vRbfkXot|accessdate=March 10, 2014|quote=Over the past week, a half-dozen Washington Republicans have described Jolly’s campaign against Democrat Alex Sink as a Keystone Cops operation, marked by inept fundraising, top advisers stationed hundreds of miles away from the district in the state capital and the poor optics of a just-divorced, 41-year-old candidate accompanied on the campaign trail by a girlfriend 14 years his junior. The sources would speak only on condition of anonymity.}}</ref> and voters were generally unhappy with the overwhelming number of attack ads on both sides.<ref name=TBOwinst1st/>

Jolly won the election on March 11, 2014 with 48.4% of the vote after being behind in the early tallies; he was sworn into office on March 13.<ref name=swornin>{{cite news|last=Cassata|first=Donna|title=Florida's Jolly Sworn in as Newest Congressman|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/floridas-jolly-sworn-newest-congressman-22900163|accessdate=January 22, 2015|newspaper=Associated Press|date=March 13, 2014}}</ref>

===2014 general election===
Jolly ran for reelection to his first full term in November 2014. He was unopposed in the Republican primary, and no Democrat ran against him in the general election; his only challenger was Lucas Overby, the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] nominee who came in third in the special election one year prior. Jolly defeated Overby with 75% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|title=U.S. House Election Results|url=http://elections.huffingtonpost.com/2014/results/house|accessdate=February 29, 2016|publisher=Huffington Post}}</ref>

===2016 U.S. Senate election===
{{main article|United States Senate election in Florida, 2016}}

On July 20, 2015, Jolly announced that he was giving up his seat to run for the [[United States Senate]] seat being vacated by [[Marco Rubio]], who was not running for reelection due to [[Marco Rubio presidential campaign, 2016|his bid]] for the [[President of the United States|U.S. presidency]].<ref name=SenateRun>{{cite web|author=Associated Press |url=http://jacksonville.com/breaking-news/2015-07-20/story/florida-congressman-david-jolly-announces-run-marco-rubios-us-senate |title=Florida Congressman David Jolly running for Senate; ex-Gov.

===2016 general election===
In his bid for a second full term, Jolly faced former Florida governor [[Charlie Crist]], a St. Petersburg resident. He found himself in a district that had been made significantly more Democratic after a court threw out Florida's original congressional map. Notably, it absorbed a heavily Democratic portion of southern Pinellas County. It now included almost all of St. Petersburg.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://wusfnews.wusf.usf.edu/post/crist-revives-political-career-win-over-jolly|title=Crist Revives Political Career With Win over Jolly|publisher=[[WUSF-FM]]|author1=Steve Newborn|author2=Mark Schreiner|date=2016-11-09}}</ref> Previously, some of the more Democratic portions of St. Petersburg had been in the Tampa-based 14th District.

Ultimately, Jolly lost to Crist by 51.9% to 48.1%.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nytimes.com/elections/results/florida-house-district-13-jolly-crist|title=Florida U.S. House 13th District Results: Charlie Crist Wins|work=New York Times|date=11 November 2016|accessdate=11 November 2016}}</ref> Jolly's defeat ended a 62-year hold on this St. Petersburg-based district by the GOP.
