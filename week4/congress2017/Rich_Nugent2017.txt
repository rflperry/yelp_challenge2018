;Spending cuts
Nugent is against what he terms out of control spending presently happening in Washington.  He opposed the $700 billion bailout by President George W. Bush, a temporary fix for de-regulation of the banking and finance industries, two unfunded Bush-era wars, and a decades-long wage decrease.  He also opposed the Obama Administration's $862 billion stimulus package.

;Tax Reform
Nugent signed on as a co-sponsor of H.R. 25, better known as "[[FairTax|The Fair Tax]]".  This legislation introduced by Rep. Rob Woodall (R-GA) would abolish the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), repeal the federal income tax, and replace it with a transparent tax on consumption.<ref>[http://nugent.house.gov/issue/taxes ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602055335/http://nugent.house.gov/issue/taxes |date=June 2, 2011 }}</ref>

In 2010 Nugent signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Nugent_Richard.pdf</ref>

;Health Care Act
Nugent opposed the passage of President Barack Obama's health care legislation and has vowed to work for its repeal. He has stated that he is open to listening to anybody's plan to save and reform Medicare so long as benefits are completely unchanged for those 55 and up.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nugentforcongress.com/index.cfm/issues |title=Issues – Rich Nugent for Congress |publisher=Nugentforcongress.com |date= |accessdate=2012-05-07}}</ref>

==Personal life==
In 1975, Rich married Wendy Nugent and they have three boys. The Nugent family have been members of the First United Methodist Church of Spring Hill since 1985.

On November 2, 2015, Nugent announced that he would leave Congress at the end of his term on January 3, 2017.<ref name="Villages-News.com"/> Among the reasons given for leaving office, Nugent cited a desire to spend more time with family: “After five years of living out of a suitcase, saying goodbye almost weekly to my beloved wife, and seeing pictures of the grandkids instead of spending more of that quality time with them, the tug of being apart from family has just become too great."<ref name="Villages-News.com"/>
