;Agriculture
Coming from a state with a great economic emphasis on agriculture, Ribble advocates for continued success in the farming sector of [[Wisconsin]]. He favors less government regulation on farming, and wants to reform several [[Environmental Protection Agency]] restrictions, believing that “Wisconsin’s dairy farmers, livestock producers, and growers all will benefit from efforts to roll back EPA’s overreach.”<ref>{{cite web|title=Agriculture|url=http://ribble.house.gov/issue/agriculture|accessdate=November 20, 2012}}</ref> He is a vocal member of the [[House Agriculture Committee]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Representative Reid J.

;Budget
Ribble voted (March 2015) to support the Republican Study Committee budget. This was the most conservative of the various budget proposals considered by the House and was defeated by 294 to 132.

;Health Care

;Social Security
In a letter to House Speaker [[John Boehner]] dated October 8, 2013, Ribble proposed sweeping changes to Social Security, including continuing and accelerating increases in the retirement age, implementing the chained CPI benefit cut to Social Security, and means testing for Social Security recipients. Though claiming that these changes were necessary to "save and secure this vital, popular program", Ribble's letter also proposed cutting the FICA withholding rate and reducing the cap on wages that are used to fund the Social Security Trust Fund which would reduce revenues for the Fund.<ref>Letter from Congressman Reid J. Ribble to House Speaker John Boehner, October 8, 2013 (PDF) [http://www.onewisconsinnow.org/files/Ribble.pdf], Accessed October 11, 2013</ref>

==== Transportation ====
In June 2015, Congressman Ribble introduced the Bridge to Sustainable Infrastructure Act. Congressman Jim Renacci co-sponsored the bill with Ribble. If signed into law, the bill would provide long-term funding to the Highway Trust Fund and federal programs to rebuild roads, highways and bridges.<ref>{{Cite web|title = House duo introduce bill to fund infrastructure needs for 10 years {{!}} Ripon Advance News Service|url = http://riponadvance.com/stories/510549876-house-duo-introduce-bill-to-fund-infrastructure-needs-for-10-years|website = riponadvance.com|accessdate = June 19, 2015}}</ref> After introducing the bill, Ribble wrote in an opinion editorial on CNBC.com, " Our transportation infrastructure is ubiquitous, but it is not free."<ref>{{Cite web|title = Fix our roads and bridges now: Rep.

===Legislation===
On September 20, 2013, the House passed a bipartisan measure championed by Ribble. The measure, titled the Restoring Healthy Forests for Healthy Communities Act, aims to manage commercial timberland and the yields each field can produce. Backers of the bill say that the bill would foster job growth in rural communities where the paper industry is prevalent, such as the [[Chequamegon-Nicolet National Forest]] in [[Wisconsin]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Ribble’s Restoring Health Forests for Healthy Communities Act passes in bipartisan vote|url=http://riponadvance.com/news/ribbles-restoring-health-forests-for-healthy-communities-act-passes-in-bipartisan-vote/4857|accessdate=September 30, 2013|newspaper=The Ripon Advance|date=September 25, 2013}}</ref>
