== Early life, education, and early career ==
Smith grew up in the [[Iselin, New Jersey|Iselin]] neighborhood of [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey]], worked in his family's sporting goods business, and earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] award. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from Trenton State College (now [[The College of New Jersey]]) in 1975, he became executive director of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee in 1976. Originally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he [[Party switching in the United States|switched parties]] and became a Republican in 1978.<ref name=NYTimes>Gruson, Lindsey.

===Tenure===
Smith has a voting record as a [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservative]] and a fiscal moderate. [http://members-of-congress.insidegov.com/l/78/Christopher-H-Smith] In 2011, [[American Conservative Union]] gave Smith a lifetime score of 60%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rating Group: American Conservative Union 2011 Lifetime Score|url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/1481/rating/5997#.UTEWs-iUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

In September 2001 the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax letters]] sent to [[New York City|New York]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] passed through the post office sorting facility in [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton Township]], just east of Trenton. The facility was closed and some 800,000 pieces of mail delayed. Smith introduced a bill to waive financial penalties for people whose mail was delayed;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/hamiltonofficebinanthrax.html|title=Hamilton office bin contained anthrax|last=McNichol|first=Dunstan|date=3 November 2001|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> the banking industry agreed to waive the fees voluntarily.

Smith has worked to raise New Jersey's [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reimbursement rates to New York City levels. He voted to postpone the 2005 base closing round by two years. For over ten years he has worked to bring in $50 million for the [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst]]. The station, which designs and builds aircraft carrier catapults and arresting gear, was slated to remain open when the Pentagon released its base closing recommendations in May 2005, though it was to lose 186 jobs.

==== Healthcare ====
Smith is active in several health care issues, serving as co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force, Coalition for Autism Research and Education, and Congressional Lyme Disease, Heart and Stroke and [[Spina Bifida]] Caucuses.

He has written three major laws to address autism, including the most recent Autism CARES which included $1.3 billion in funding for research, services and supports and requires a report on aging out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=390105|title=Smith's $1.3 Billion Autism Bill on Way to President’s Desk|date=2014-08-01|website=Chris Smith|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

On May 9, 2014, Smith introduced the bill [[Autism CARES Act of 2014]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to [[autism spectrum disorders]] (autism) conducted by various agencies within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).<ref name="cbo4631">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45460|title=CBO – H.R. 4631|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Smith argued that "this is a critical investment that is working to determine the cause of ASD, identify autistic children as early as possible to begin treatment, and producing better awareness, new therapies and effective services. The quality of life of many children is at stake, as it is with young adults who age out of the support services in educational systems."<ref name="SmithPR1">{{cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=379715|title=Smith Introduces the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2014|publisher=House Office of Chris Smith|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>

;Abortion
In the house of congress, Smith is known as one of the strongest opponents of [[abortion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Smith has worked to stop abortions in military hospitals.<ref>Emanuel, Mike. [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/09/democrats-seek-lift-ban-abortions-military-hospitals-abroad/ "Democrats Seek to Lift Ban on Abortions at U.S. Military Hospitals Abroad"], [[Fox News]] Politics, June 9, 2010. Accessed October 6, 2013. "Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., says military facilities, including all hospitals, should be places of healing and should protect life. 'We will stand firm and I welcome the fight…if they want to bring it. I do believe that there will be an overwhelming vote to keep our military hospitals as nurturing centers not abortion mills,' Smith said."</ref> He has also worked to reinstate the [[Ronald Reagan]]-era restrictions that would deny federal funds to family planning organizations that distribute information about abortions abroad.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/04/opinion/unlock-family-planning-funds.html "Unlock Family Planning Funds"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 4, 1997. Accessed October 7, 2013. "But Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and an outspoken opponent of these programs, wants to offer a separate measure requiring overseas recipients of American money to promise not to perform abortions or give abortion counseling."</ref> The ensuing struggle lasted more than two years, with Smith leveraging his opposition to the family planning money to prevent passage of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]'s high-priority efforts to reorganize the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], pay U.S. dues to the [[United Nations]], and provide $18 billion for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Smith finally was forced to yield in the 1998 and 1999 omnibus spending bills, but he won in return White House agreement to restrict support for international abortion education. [[George W. Bush]] restored the [[Mexico City Policy]] in an executive order in his first full day in office, but it has since been repealed by President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>Statement released after the President rescinds "Mexico City Policy" (whitehouse.gov, 1-25-09) http://www.whitehouse.gov/statement-released-after-the-president-rescinds/</ref>

Smith also was a prime mover of legislation to ban [[Intact dilation and extraction|partial-birth abortions]]; the House voted to override Clinton's vetoes, but Smith's side fell a few votes short of the two-thirds needed in the Senate. In a January 22, 2004 press release, Smith stated, "Americans want the abortion holocaust to end" and referred to abortion as "child slaughter".<ref>[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/nj04_smith/silentnomore.html Chris Smith: Silent No More] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905050548/http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/nj04_smith/silentnomore.html |date=September 5, 2006 }}, press release dated January 22, 2004</ref>

Smith has fought not only Democrats but the House Republican leadership on the abortion issue. In July 2002 the bankruptcy bill, strongly backed by the leadership, came out of conference committee; the House had passed it 306–108 in March 2001.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} But it contained a provision, negotiated by Senator [[Charles Schumer]] and longtime abortion opponent [[Henry Hyde]], providing that court judgments or fines could not be wiped out in bankruptcy: Schumer inserted this as a favor to abortion rights groups, after some abortion protesters declared bankruptcy to avoid paying fines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Smith and [[Joe Pitts]] led a group of abortion opponents and said they would vote against the bill unless the provision was removed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In November the leadership brought forward the rule to vote on the bill, and Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]] took the unusual step of voting for it himself (the Speaker usually does not vote).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Smith and Pitts stood their ground despite furious efforts by Whip [[Tom DeLay]], and the rule went down 243–172, with 87 Republicans voting against.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It was only the second rule defeated during Hastert's first four years as speaker, and Hastert called Smith into his office to scold him in January 2003. Smith won a legislative victory in 2004 when a provision stating that state and local governments could not require hospitals and care providers to perform abortions was put in the omnibus appropriation. He continues to push for his legislation, the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, which requires doctors to inform pregnant women that some experts say fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks.

Smith serves as Co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.

He spoke at the annual [[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]] rally in Washington, DC, on January 22, 2009, and 2010. [http://www.marchforlife.org/]

Smith expressed support for the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enact Stupak-Pitts Amendment On Health Care Bill|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/468196/enact-stupak-pitts-amendment-on-health-care-bill#.UTEfN-iUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Smith introduced into the 113th Congress a similar but more expanded bill, H.R. 7, also titled the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, which, beyond its title prohibition, disallows as a medical income tax deduction any personal funds used for an abortion or expenses paid out of tax-exempt "cafeteria" health plans, or personally-funded [[Medical savings account (United States)|Archer Medical Savings Accounts]] (MSAs) or [[health savings account]]s (HSAs). The bill also excludes from the definition of a “qualified health plan” any insurance coverage that includes abortions, rendering such plans ineligible for a tax credit to individuals or employers.<ref>”H.R. 7 – No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, Congress.gov, [http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/7] Retrieved January 15, 2014</ref> The bill was co-sponsored by 151 Republicans and three Democrats.<ref>”H.R. 7 – No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, Congress.gov [http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/7/cosponsors], Retrieved January 15, 2014</ref> Supporters claim that H.R. 7 is necessary because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act.<ref>"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act", Susan B.

;Stem cell research
His belief in a "right to life" has also led Smith to oppose both capital punishment and [[embryonic stem cell]] research. On the issue of stem cell research, Smith has actively worked to increase research into non-embryonic stem cells. Smith's "Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005", which provides $265 million for stem cell therapy, umbilical [[cord blood]] and bone marrow treatment was signed into law by President George W. Bush in December 2005.

In July 2006, Smith voted to uphold President Bush's veto of legislation that promoted embryonic stem cell research<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) Floor Statement in Support of Presidential Veto of Embryonic Stem Cell Research Legislation (HR 810)|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/196320/rep-chris-smith-r-nj-floor-statement-in-support-of-presidential-veto-of-embryonic-stem-cell-research-legislation-hr-810#.UTEcMuiUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> and called for increased investment for cord blood and bone marrow stem cell research.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smith: Federal Funds for Cord Blood Banking, Stem Cell Research Will Save Lives|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/224816/smith-federal-funds-for-cord-blood-banking-stem-cell-research-will-save-lives#.UTEcj-iUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

Smith authored the law to reauthorize the programs in 2015: the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2820, Became Public Law No: 114-104). Under his law, the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program will be authorized for five years at $30 million annually, while the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) is authorized at $23 million annually for a five-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2820?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+2820%22%5D%7D&resultIndex=1|title=Congress.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

At the time, Smith stated: "It remains one of the best kept secrets in America that umbilical cord blood stem cells and adult stem cells in general are curing people of a myriad of terrible conditions and diseases in adults as well as children. Cord blood, what was once seen as medical waste, is now making miracles."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398630|title=Smith’s Bipartisan Stem Cell Bill Heads to the President’s Desk|date=2015-12-16|website=Chris Smith|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

==== Guns ====
Smith co-sponsored an amendment in 2003 to renew the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]].<ref>{{USBill|108|H.R.|2038}}, {{USBill|108|H.R.|3831}}</ref> He was endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign]] in 2006<ref>http://www.bradycampaign.org/media/press/view/847{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and 2008.<ref>http://www.bradycampaign.org/media/press/view/1073{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==== Human rights ====

In 1994, Smith voted for the original Violence Against Women Act (PL 103-322) and was the author of the public law which included the first reauthorization of VAWA in 2000, Division B of Rep. Smith’s Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (PL 106-386/ TVPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/lawsandresolutions/tvpa.htm|title=Chris Smith|website=chrissmith.house.gov|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

Smith has voted seven times to establish or reauthorize VAWA programs. He has also given floor speeches<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-09-19/pdf/CREC-2014-09-19.pdf|title=Congressional Record|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> and written an op-ed on its importance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20160919/NEWS/160919708|title=Letter to the editor: The fight to end domestic violence|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

In 1995, Smith urged then-First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] to speak out about human rights abuses while visiting [[China]]. He called her speech at the UN Conference in Beijing, which criticized China for seeking to limit free and open discussion of women's issues  "eloquent" and praised her for "raising the issue" in China.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/06/world/hillary-clinton-in-china-details-abuse-of-women.html</ref>

He was appointed chairman of the House International Relations Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations Subcommittee in 2005. He is also vice-chairman of the Committee on International Relations and as of 2011 became Chairman of the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (also known as the United States Helsinki Commission), which works to promote and foster democracy, human rights, and stability in Eastern and Central Europe.

Since being elected to Congress, Smith has also played a key role over the years promoting human rights reforms in the former Soviet Union, Romania, Vietnam, China, Sudan, Cuba, and elsewhere. He wrote the provision of the law that barred the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (the predecessor body of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) from training in the United States with U.S. law enforcement personnel until it was certified that the force met stringent human rights standards. That certification was issued in December 2001 by President George W. Bush.

One of Smith’s significant legislative achievements is his Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Law, the nations' first law that deals specifically with human trafficking. This law provided government prosecutors with the resources needed to prosecute offenders as well as resources to help victims rebuild their lives.

Smith began investigating and working to end the human trafficking epidemic in the mid-1990s. Trafficking is a $9 billion industry, the third largest source of income for organized crime and the second fastest growing criminal activity in the world, equal with illegal arms sales.

In 2003, a second Smith trafficking law—the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act—took effect and further strengthened his original law. Smith’s original trafficking law also reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, the most significant law to help protect women who are victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Like the trafficking component, the VAWA reauthorization works to ensure prosecution of offenders and help the victims recover.

In January 2006, President George W. Bush signed Smith’s third trafficking law—the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005, which strengthens the nation’s current trafficking law (which he also authored in 2000), authorizes new funds for investigation and prosecution of domestic trafficking within the United States and to helps the young women and children who are most often the victims of human trafficking operations.

Smith has strongly criticized [[China]] for its forced sterilizations and abortions and its persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, and opposed normal trade relations with China. In July 2003, after a provision for $50 million for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] passed by one vote in committee, he led the fight against it and it was defeated on the floor 216–211.

Smith has condemned [[Russia]] for barring entry of foreign [[Roman Catholic]] priests and the Saudis for treating foreign servants as slaves. In 2000 he had the signal success of pushing to passage a bill combating sex trafficking around the world, including a provision opposed by the Clinton administration requiring yearly reports on each nation's record; Clinton signed it anyway. Smith then in 2003 worked to extend it to 2005. He has also taken action on the subject—when he heard about [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] girls being held against their will in brothels in [[Montenegro]], he called the Montenegrin prime minister, who ordered a raid on the operation. He has worked to secure grant funding for Project Polaris, a New York-New Jersey group combating sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grant Will Help Fight Trafficking in NJ|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=56974|work=Congressman Chris Smith: News|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

Smith has also been a strong supporter of issues of importance to Armenian Americans, including U.S. recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Smith public statements on Armenian Genocide|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/public-statements/26952/chris-smith/?search=Armenian#.UTEevOiUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2003 he successfully sponsored a law providing $81 million for centers in the U.S. and abroad to counsel victims of torture. In July 2004 the House passed 323–45 his bill to bar increased aid to [[Vietnam]] unless the administration finds substantial progress toward releasing political prisoners and fostering religious freedom and democratic government.

Smith's moral views have led him to take stands unusual for a Republican on domestic issues. In July 2003 he cast a critical vote in committee for [[Henry Waxman]]'s resolution of approval for future global climate change agreements. In October 2004 he voted against [[James Sensenbrenner]]'s amendment broadening the category of illegal immigrants subject to immediate deportation.

In May 2012, while holed up in the United States Embassy in Beijing, Chinese dissident [[Chen Guangcheng]] telephoned Smith to seek his advice. Smith suggested that Chen seek to depart China and continue to push for human rights in China from outside the country.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304020104577384253042010624.html From China Activist's Flight, a Diplomatic Crisis]</ref>  After leaving the embassy, and while being treated at a Beijing hospital, he telephoned Smith during a session of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/03/politics/obama-china/?hpt=hp_t1 Chen case is another human rights issue for Obama]</ref> Smith spoke with Chen and allowed Chen to make statements and ask questions to those present in the Committee room.<ref>[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/hearings/general/hearing6/index.php Recent Developments and History of the Chen Guangcheng Case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506053605/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/hearings/general/hearing6/index.php |date=May 6, 2012 }}</ref>

Weeks after the [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign]] and [[Umbrella Movement]] broke out which demands [[2014 Hong Kong protests|genuine universal suffrage among other goals]], the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] chair Rep. Smith and co-chair U.S. Senator [[Sherrod Brown]] along with bipartisan Senators [[Ben Cardin]], [[Marco Rubio]], [[Roger Wicker]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Jeff Merkley]] and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], Congressmen [[Dan Lipinski]] and [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] introduced the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]], which would update the [[United States–Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992]] and U.S. commitment to [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|Hong Kong's freedom and democracy]]. "The [[Hong Kong–Mainland conflict|steady erosion]] of Hong Kong’s [[autonomy]] is the concern... Protecting these [[fundamental freedoms]] are a bedrock interest of U.S. foreign policy. The special privileges the U.S. grants to Hong Kong can only exist and endure if Beijing fulfills its commitments, including guaranteeing [[human rights]] and free and fair [[elections]].” Smith said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=6a3ecd77-5afb-47be-b4e5-6afae6fd8f1e |title=Wicker Joins Bill to Support Hong Kong's Freedom and Democracy |date=November 13, 2014 |publisher=[[Roger Wicker]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2922 S.2922 - Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act], [[Congress.gov]], 11/13/2014</ref><ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5696 H.R.5696 - Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act], [[Congress.gov]], 11/13/2014</ref><ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1159 H.R.1159 - Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act], [[Congress.gov]], 2/27/2015</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/gordon-crovitz-china-voids-hong-kong-rights-1418601004 |title=China ‘Voids’ Hong Kong Rights: Beijing abrogates the 1984 treaty it signed with Britain to guarantee the city’s autonomy |date=December 14, 2014 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-useful-hong-kong-rebuke-1422663941 |title=A Useful Hong Kong Rebuke: China’s betrayal of its promises becomes a U.S. political issue |date=January 30, 2015 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>

He does not support gay marriage or LGBTQ protections. Smith stated in February 2015: "I am a strong believer in traditional marriage and do not construe homosexual rights as human rights."

;Veterans
In January 2001, Smith became chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs Committee]] and there pushed for policies opposed by the Republican leadership, including voting against the Republican and for the Democratic budget resolution because the latter included more spending on veterans programs, which resulted in his losing the chairmanship in January 2005, two years short of the normal six-year term.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Dumping of Rep. Chris Smith A hard fall from grace|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-01-12/news/25434723_1_veterans-services-va-hospitals-veterans-population|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=Philly.com|date=12 January 2005}}</ref>  In his four years, Smith's committee passed veterans bills that increased [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] disability payments by $2.5 billion, increased G.I. Bill of Rights spending 46%, authorized $1 billion in aid to homeless veterans, and added $100 million in health care benefits for surviving spouses of veterans. Smith's 2004 bill increased from 18 to 24 months the coverage of the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]], set up a pilot program for recruitment of nurses, and authorized a new research center of veterans with multi-trauma combat injuries.

Veterans' laws authored by Smith include one providing a record 46 percent increase in the [[GI Bill]], which helps veterans pay for college. That increase is the largest since the GI Bill went into effect following [[World War II]].

Smith also wrote the nation's first law that addresses and combats the plague of chronic homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act authorizes $1 billion in programs to help veterans find and retain jobs and provides them with housing, counseling, and medical care they need to rebuild their lives.

For three years, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] explicitly forbade spending on Smith's four research centers to develop responses to chemical, biological and radiological attacks. In early 2003, Smith called for making veterans benefits an entitlement—mandatory spending that would not have to go through Appropriations. GOP leadership opposed and there were threats he'd lose the chair. In 2003, he voted for the Republican budget resolution that included a $1.8 billion increase in veterans spending, but in July 2003, appropriators did not include the money; Smith opposed that but disappointed Democrats by not voting against the vote sending the measure to the floor.

Smith did not expect a challenge for the chair when Congress convened in 2005. However, [[Steve Buyer]], the fourth ranking Republican on the committee, asked for an interview with the [[Steering and Policy Committee of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Steering Committee]], and on January 5, 2005 it voted to make him chairman. That decision was ratified by the Republican Conference on January 6, and Smith was removed from the committee altogether. He was obviously disappointed. "I don't look at power as something to hold. I see the power of the gavel as a strategic opportunity to do good, to use it in every way to help veterans," he said in his speech to the Conference. New Jersey Republicans expressed dismay, and New Jersey Democrats and the leaders of just about every veterans group expressed outrage.

===Controversy===
It was revealed in October 2015 that intern applicants for Smith's office were required to rate "27 different personalities, organizations and political issues to indicate whether they tend to agree with them, disagree with them or have no opinion or knowledge of them."<ref>http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2015/10/chris-smiths-intern-applicants-rate-rachel-maddow-nra-the-pope-093706</ref> Personalities and organizations included [[Rachel Maddow]], the [[Pope]], [[Planned Parenthood]], and The National Right to Life Committee.

"I just don’t think that kids, undergraduates, ought to be subjected to what is obviously an ideological test," commented political scientist [[Russ Baker]] of [[Rutgers University]]. "There’s something about this that’s really, really troubling."

===Legislation===
On May 6, 2014, Smith introduced the bill [[International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573; 113th Congress)]], which would require the notification of foreign governments when an American registered as a [[sex offender]] of children is going to be traveling to their country.<ref name=MoodyYahooMay20>{{cite news|last=Moody|first=Chris|title=House prepares for rare votes on standalone bills to curb human trafficking|url=http://news.yahoo.com/house-prepares-for-rare-votes-on-standalone-bills-to-curb-human-trafficking-142803176.html|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=Yahoo!

The [http://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/goldmanact.pdf Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction and Return Act (Public Law 113-150)] was signed by the president on August 8, 2014. This law provides the U.S. State Department with eight escalating penalties that can be applied to foreign governments who refuse to return American children who have been abducted to their country. It is named after New Jersey resident David Goldman, who was fighting to bring his son home from Brazil for years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/lawsandresolutions/the-sean-and-david-goldman-intl-child-abduction-prevention-and-return-act.htm|title=Chris Smith|website=chrissmith.house.gov|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

On September 6, 2016 the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] passed the [http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399637 Gold Star Families Voices Act], authored by Smith. The bill would allow the veterans oral history program to include histories by family members of servicemembers who became missing in action or died as a result of their wartime service.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4511|title=Congress.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

He is currently the dean of the New Jersey congressional delegation.

== Early life, education, and early career ==
Smith grew up in the [[Iselin, New Jersey|Iselin]] neighborhood of [[Woodbridge Township, New Jersey]], worked in his family's sporting goods business, and earned the [[Eagle Scout (Boy Scouts of America)|Eagle Scout]] award. After graduating with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] from Trenton State College (now [[The College of New Jersey]]) in 1975, he became executive director of the New Jersey Right to Life Committee in 1976. Originally a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he [[Party switching in the United States|switched parties]] and became a Republican in 1978.<ref name=NYTimes>Gruson, Lindsey.

"He switched parties but lost in 1978 as the token opposition to Frank Thompson, a veteran Democrat who was chairman of the House Administration Committee. But he won in 1980, when Mr. Thompson was convicted of bribery and conspiracy in the Abscam scandal and later served two years in prison."</ref>

While working at his family's sporting goods store, 25-year-old Smith ran for Congress as a Republican [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1978|in 1978]].

===Tenure===
Smith has a voting record as a [[Social conservatism in the United States|social conservative]] and a fiscal moderate. [http://members-of-congress.insidegov.com/l/78/Christopher-H-Smith] In 2011, [[American Conservative Union]] gave Smith a lifetime score of 60%.<ref>{{cite web|title=Rating Group: American Conservative Union 2011 Lifetime Score|url=http://votesmart.org/interest-group/1481/rating/5997#.UTEWs-iUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

In September 2001 the [[2001 anthrax attacks|anthrax letters]] sent to [[New York City|New York]] and [[Washington, D.C.]] passed through the post office sorting facility in [[Hamilton Township, Mercer County, New Jersey|Hamilton Township]], just east of Trenton. The facility was closed and some 800,000 pieces of mail delayed. Smith introduced a bill to waive financial penalties for people whose mail was delayed;<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.ph.ucla.edu/epi/bioter/hamiltonofficebinanthrax.html|title=Hamilton office bin contained anthrax|last=McNichol|first=Dunstan|date=3 November 2001|newspaper=The Star-Ledger|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> the banking industry agreed to waive the fees voluntarily.

Smith has worked to raise New Jersey's [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reimbursement rates to New York City levels. He voted to postpone the 2005 base closing round by two years. For over ten years he has worked to bring in $50 million for the [[Naval Air Engineering Station Lakehurst]]. The station, which designs and builds aircraft carrier catapults and arresting gear, was slated to remain open when the Pentagon released its base closing recommendations in May 2005, though it was to lose 186 jobs.

==== Healthcare ====
Smith is active in several health care issues, serving as co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Alzheimer's Task Force, Coalition for Autism Research and Education, and Congressional Lyme Disease, Heart and Stroke and [[Spina Bifida]] Caucuses.

He has written three major laws to address autism, including the most recent Autism CARES which included $1.3 billion in funding for research, services and supports and requires a report on aging out.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=390105|title=Smith's $1.3 Billion Autism Bill on Way to President’s Desk|date=2014-08-01|website=Chris Smith|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

On May 9, 2014, Smith introduced the bill [[Autism CARES Act of 2014]], a bill that would amend the [[Public Health Service Act]] to reauthorize research, surveillance, and education activities related to [[autism spectrum disorders]] (autism) conducted by various agencies within the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS).<ref name="cbo4631">{{cite web|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45460|title=CBO – H.R. 4631|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=24 June 2014}}</ref> Smith argued that "this is a critical investment that is working to determine the cause of ASD, identify autistic children as early as possible to begin treatment, and producing better awareness, new therapies and effective services. The quality of life of many children is at stake, as it is with young adults who age out of the support services in educational systems."<ref name="SmithPR1">{{cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=379715|title=Smith Introduces the Combating Autism Reauthorization Act of 2014|publisher=House Office of Chris Smith|accessdate=25 June 2014}}</ref>

;Abortion
In the house of congress, Smith is known as one of the strongest opponents of [[abortion]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Smith has worked to stop abortions in military hospitals.<ref>Emanuel, Mike. [http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/06/09/democrats-seek-lift-ban-abortions-military-hospitals-abroad/ "Democrats Seek to Lift Ban on Abortions at U.S. Military Hospitals Abroad"], [[Fox News]] Politics, June 9, 2010. Accessed October 6, 2013. "Rep. Chris Smith, R-N.J., says military facilities, including all hospitals, should be places of healing and should protect life. 'We will stand firm and I welcome the fight…if they want to bring it. I do believe that there will be an overwhelming vote to keep our military hospitals as nurturing centers not abortion mills,' Smith said."</ref> He has also worked to reinstate the [[Ronald Reagan]]-era restrictions that would deny federal funds to family planning organizations that distribute information about abortions abroad.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/04/opinion/unlock-family-planning-funds.html "Unlock Family Planning Funds"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 4, 1997. Accessed October 7, 2013. "But Representative Chris Smith, a New Jersey Republican and an outspoken opponent of these programs, wants to offer a separate measure requiring overseas recipients of American money to promise not to perform abortions or give abortion counseling."</ref> The ensuing struggle lasted more than two years, with Smith leveraging his opposition to the family planning money to prevent passage of the [[Bill Clinton|Clinton administration]]'s high-priority efforts to reorganize the [[United States Department of State|State Department]], pay U.S. dues to the [[United Nations]], and provide $18 billion for the [[International Monetary Fund]].{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Smith finally was forced to yield in the 1998 and 1999 omnibus spending bills, but he won in return White House agreement to restrict support for international abortion education. [[George W. Bush]] restored the [[Mexico City Policy]] in an executive order in his first full day in office, but it has since been repealed by President [[Barack Obama]].<ref>Statement released after the President rescinds "Mexico City Policy" (whitehouse.gov, 1-25-09) http://www.whitehouse.gov/statement-released-after-the-president-rescinds/</ref>

Smith also was a prime mover of legislation to ban [[Intact dilation and extraction|partial-birth abortions]]; the House voted to override Clinton's vetoes, but Smith's side fell a few votes short of the two-thirds needed in the Senate. In a January 22, 2004 press release, Smith stated, "Americans want the abortion holocaust to end" and referred to abortion as "child slaughter".<ref>[http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/nj04_smith/silentnomore.html Chris Smith: Silent No More] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060905050548/http://www.house.gov/apps/list/press/nj04_smith/silentnomore.html |date=September 5, 2006 }}, press release dated January 22, 2004</ref>

Smith has fought not only Democrats but the House Republican leadership on the abortion issue. In July 2002 the bankruptcy bill, strongly backed by the leadership, came out of conference committee; the House had passed it 306–108 in March 2001.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} But it contained a provision, negotiated by Senator [[Charles Schumer]] and longtime abortion opponent [[Henry Hyde]], providing that court judgments or fines could not be wiped out in bankruptcy: Schumer inserted this as a favor to abortion rights groups, after some abortion protesters declared bankruptcy to avoid paying fines.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} Smith and [[Joe Pitts]] led a group of abortion opponents and said they would vote against the bill unless the provision was removed.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} In November the leadership brought forward the rule to vote on the bill, and Speaker [[Dennis Hastert]] took the unusual step of voting for it himself (the Speaker usually does not vote).{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

Smith and Pitts stood their ground despite furious efforts by Whip [[Tom DeLay]], and the rule went down 243–172, with 87 Republicans voting against.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} It was only the second rule defeated during Hastert's first four years as speaker, and Hastert called Smith into his office to scold him in January 2003. Smith won a legislative victory in 2004 when a provision stating that state and local governments could not require hospitals and care providers to perform abortions was put in the omnibus appropriation. He continues to push for his legislation, the Unborn Child Pain Awareness Act, which requires doctors to inform pregnant women that some experts say fetus can feel pain after 20 weeks.

Smith serves as Co-chairman of the Congressional Pro-Life Caucus.

He spoke at the annual [[March for Life (Washington, D.C.)|March for Life]] rally in Washington, DC, on January 22, 2009, and 2010. [http://www.marchforlife.org/]

Smith expressed support for the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], an amendment to America's Affordable Health Choices Act of 2009.<ref>{{cite web|title=Enact Stupak-Pitts Amendment On Health Care Bill|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/468196/enact-stupak-pitts-amendment-on-health-care-bill#.UTEfN-iUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2013, Smith introduced into the 113th Congress a similar but more expanded bill, H.R. 7, also titled the “No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, which, beyond its title prohibition, disallows as a medical income tax deduction any personal funds used for an abortion or expenses paid out of tax-exempt "cafeteria" health plans, or personally-funded [[Medical savings account (United States)|Archer Medical Savings Accounts]] (MSAs) or [[health savings account]]s (HSAs). The bill also excludes from the definition of a “qualified health plan” any insurance coverage that includes abortions, rendering such plans ineligible for a tax credit to individuals or employers.<ref>”H.R. 7 – No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, Congress.gov, [http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th/house-bill/7] Retrieved January 15, 2014</ref> The bill was co-sponsored by 151 Republicans and three Democrats.<ref>”H.R. 7 – No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act”, Congress.gov [http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/7/cosponsors], Retrieved January 15, 2014</ref> Supporters claim that H.R. 7 is necessary because of provisions in the Affordable Care Act.<ref>"No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act", Susan B.

;Stem cell research
His belief in a "right to life" has also led Smith to oppose both capital punishment and [[embryonic stem cell]] research. On the issue of stem cell research, Smith has actively worked to increase research into non-embryonic stem cells. Smith's "Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005", which provides $265 million for stem cell therapy, umbilical [[cord blood]] and bone marrow treatment was signed into law by President George W. Bush in December 2005.

In July 2006, Smith voted to uphold President Bush's veto of legislation that promoted embryonic stem cell research<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) Floor Statement in Support of Presidential Veto of Embryonic Stem Cell Research Legislation (HR 810)|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/196320/rep-chris-smith-r-nj-floor-statement-in-support-of-presidential-veto-of-embryonic-stem-cell-research-legislation-hr-810#.UTEcMuiUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref> and called for increased investment for cord blood and bone marrow stem cell research.<ref>{{cite web|title=Smith: Federal Funds for Cord Blood Banking, Stem Cell Research Will Save Lives|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/224816/smith-federal-funds-for-cord-blood-banking-stem-cell-research-will-save-lives#.UTEcj-iUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

Smith authored the law to reauthorize the programs in 2015: the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act (H.R. 2820, Became Public Law No: 114-104). Under his law, the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program will be authorized for five years at $30 million annually, while the National Cord Blood Inventory (NCBI) is authorized at $23 million annually for a five-year period.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/2820?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22hr+2820%22%5D%7D&resultIndex=1|title=Congress.gov|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

At the time, Smith stated: "It remains one of the best kept secrets in America that umbilical cord blood stem cells and adult stem cells in general are curing people of a myriad of terrible conditions and diseases in adults as well as children. Cord blood, what was once seen as medical waste, is now making miracles."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=398630|title=Smith’s Bipartisan Stem Cell Bill Heads to the President’s Desk|date=2015-12-16|website=Chris Smith|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

==== Guns ====
Smith co-sponsored an amendment in 2003 to renew the [[Federal Assault Weapons Ban]].<ref>{{USBill|108|H.R.|2038}}, {{USBill|108|H.R.|3831}}</ref> He was endorsed by the [[Brady Campaign]] in 2006<ref>http://www.bradycampaign.org/media/press/view/847{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and 2008.<ref>http://www.bradycampaign.org/media/press/view/1073{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

==== Human rights ====

In 1994, Smith voted for the original Violence Against Women Act (PL 103-322) and was the author of the public law which included the first reauthorization of VAWA in 2000, Division B of Rep. Smith’s Victims of Trafficking and Violence Prevention Act (PL 106-386/ TVPA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/lawsandresolutions/tvpa.htm|title=Chris Smith|website=chrissmith.house.gov|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

Smith has voted seven times to establish or reauthorize VAWA programs. He has also given floor speeches<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CREC-2014-09-19/pdf/CREC-2014-09-19.pdf|title=Congressional Record|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> and written an op-ed on its importance.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.trentonian.com/article/TT/20160919/NEWS/160919708|title=Letter to the editor: The fight to end domestic violence|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>

In 1995, Smith urged then-First Lady [[Hillary Clinton]] to speak out about human rights abuses while visiting [[China]]. He called her speech at the UN Conference in Beijing, which criticized China for seeking to limit free and open discussion of women's issues  "eloquent" and praised her for "raising the issue" in China.<ref>http://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/06/world/hillary-clinton-in-china-details-abuse-of-women.html</ref>

He was appointed chairman of the House International Relations Africa, Global Human Rights and International Operations Subcommittee in 2005. He is also vice-chairman of the Committee on International Relations and as of 2011 became Chairman of the [[Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe]] (also known as the United States Helsinki Commission), which works to promote and foster democracy, human rights, and stability in Eastern and Central Europe.

Since being elected to Congress, Smith has also played a key role over the years promoting human rights reforms in the former Soviet Union, Romania, Vietnam, China, Sudan, Cuba, and elsewhere. He wrote the provision of the law that barred the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (the predecessor body of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]) from training in the United States with U.S. law enforcement personnel until it was certified that the force met stringent human rights standards. That certification was issued in December 2001 by President George W. Bush.

One of Smith’s significant legislative achievements is his Victims of Trafficking and Violence Protection Law, the nations' first law that deals specifically with human trafficking. This law provided government prosecutors with the resources needed to prosecute offenders as well as resources to help victims rebuild their lives.

Smith began investigating and working to end the human trafficking epidemic in the mid-1990s. Trafficking is a $9 billion industry, the third largest source of income for organized crime and the second fastest growing criminal activity in the world, equal with illegal arms sales.

In 2003, a second Smith trafficking law—the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act—took effect and further strengthened his original law. Smith’s original trafficking law also reauthorized the Violence Against Women Act, the most significant law to help protect women who are victims of rape, sexual assault, and domestic violence. Like the trafficking component, the VAWA reauthorization works to ensure prosecution of offenders and help the victims recover.

In January 2006, President George W. Bush signed Smith’s third trafficking law—the Trafficking Victims Protection Act of 2005, which strengthens the nation’s current trafficking law (which he also authored in 2000), authorizes new funds for investigation and prosecution of domestic trafficking within the United States and to helps the young women and children who are most often the victims of human trafficking operations.

Smith has strongly criticized [[China]] for its forced sterilizations and abortions and its persecution of Christians and other religious minorities, and opposed normal trade relations with China. In July 2003, after a provision for $50 million for the [[United Nations Population Fund]] passed by one vote in committee, he led the fight against it and it was defeated on the floor 216–211.

Smith has condemned [[Russia]] for barring entry of foreign [[Roman Catholic]] priests and the Saudis for treating foreign servants as slaves. In 2000 he had the signal success of pushing to passage a bill combating sex trafficking around the world, including a provision opposed by the Clinton administration requiring yearly reports on each nation's record; Clinton signed it anyway. Smith then in 2003 worked to extend it to 2005. He has also taken action on the subject—when he heard about [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] girls being held against their will in brothels in [[Montenegro]], he called the Montenegrin prime minister, who ordered a raid on the operation. He has worked to secure grant funding for Project Polaris, a New York-New Jersey group combating sex trafficking.<ref>{{cite web|title=Grant Will Help Fight Trafficking in NJ|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=56974|work=Congressman Chris Smith: News|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

Smith has also been a strong supporter of issues of importance to Armenian Americans, including U.S. recognition of the [[Armenian Genocide]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Chris Smith public statements on Armenian Genocide|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/public-statements/26952/chris-smith/?search=Armenian#.UTEevOiUuUY|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=1 March 2013}}</ref>

In 2003 he successfully sponsored a law providing $81 million for centers in the U.S. and abroad to counsel victims of torture. In July 2004 the House passed 323–45 his bill to bar increased aid to [[Vietnam]] unless the administration finds substantial progress toward releasing political prisoners and fostering religious freedom and democratic government.

Smith's moral views have led him to take stands unusual for a Republican on domestic issues. In July 2003 he cast a critical vote in committee for [[Henry Waxman]]'s resolution of approval for future global climate change agreements. In October 2004 he voted against [[James Sensenbrenner]]'s amendment broadening the category of illegal immigrants subject to immediate deportation.

Smith was a staunch supporter of David Goldman, a New Jersey resident, during the [[Goldman child abduction case]],<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/record.xpd?id=111-h20090603-55 Rep Chris Smith: On Sean Goldman – Justice Delayed Again]</ref> traveling with him to Brazil, advocating for him in Congress and writing H.R. 2702 to suspend Brazil's [[Generalized System of Preferences]] trading benefit,<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-2702&tab=summary H.R. 2702: To suspend the application of Generalized System of Preferences for Brazil until such time as...]</ref> as well as H.R. 3240, the "International Child Abduction Prevention Act of 2009".<ref>http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?c111:H.R.3240.IH:</ref> He has subsequently spoken several times on [[international child abduction]] generally and on [[International child abduction in Japan]] specifically.

In May 2012, while holed up in the United States Embassy in Beijing, Chinese dissident [[Chen Guangcheng]] telephoned Smith to seek his advice. Smith suggested that Chen seek to depart China and continue to push for human rights in China from outside the country.<ref>[http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052702304020104577384253042010624.html From China Activist's Flight, a Diplomatic Crisis]</ref>  After leaving the embassy, and while being treated at a Beijing hospital, he telephoned Smith during a session of the Congressional-Executive Commission on China.<ref>[http://edition.cnn.com/2012/05/03/politics/obama-china/?hpt=hp_t1 Chen case is another human rights issue for Obama]</ref> Smith spoke with Chen and allowed Chen to make statements and ask questions to those present in the Committee room.<ref>[http://www.cecc.gov/pages/hearings/general/hearing6/index.php Recent Developments and History of the Chen Guangcheng Case] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120506053605/http://www.cecc.gov/pages/hearings/general/hearing6/index.php |date=May 6, 2012 }}</ref>

Weeks after the [[2014 Hong Kong class boycott campaign]] and [[Umbrella Movement]] broke out which demands [[2014 Hong Kong protests|genuine universal suffrage among other goals]], the [[Congressional-Executive Commission on China]] chair Rep. Smith and co-chair U.S. Senator [[Sherrod Brown]] along with bipartisan Senators [[Ben Cardin]], [[Marco Rubio]], [[Roger Wicker]], [[Dianne Feinstein]], [[Jeff Merkley]] and [[Party leaders of the United States House of Representatives|Democratic Leader of the U.S. House of Representatives]] [[Nancy Pelosi]], Congressmen [[Dan Lipinski]] and [[Frank Wolf (politician)|Frank Wolf]] introduced the [[Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act]], which would update the [[United States–Hong Kong Policy Act of 1992]] and U.S. commitment to [[Democratic development in Hong Kong|Hong Kong's freedom and democracy]]. "The [[Hong Kong–Mainland conflict|steady erosion]] of Hong Kong’s [[autonomy]] is the concern... Protecting these [[fundamental freedoms]] are a bedrock interest of U.S. foreign policy. The special privileges the U.S. grants to Hong Kong can only exist and endure if Beijing fulfills its commitments, including guaranteeing [[human rights]] and free and fair [[elections]].” Smith said.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wicker.senate.gov/public/index.cfm/press-releases?ID=6a3ecd77-5afb-47be-b4e5-6afae6fd8f1e |title=Wicker Joins Bill to Support Hong Kong's Freedom and Democracy |date=November 13, 2014 |publisher=[[Roger Wicker]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2922 S.2922 - Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act], [[Congress.gov]], 11/13/2014</ref><ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5696 H.R.5696 - Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act], [[Congress.gov]], 11/13/2014</ref><ref>[https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1159 H.R.1159 - Hong Kong Human Rights and Democracy Act], [[Congress.gov]], 2/27/2015</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/gordon-crovitz-china-voids-hong-kong-rights-1418601004 |title=China ‘Voids’ Hong Kong Rights: Beijing abrogates the 1984 treaty it signed with Britain to guarantee the city’s autonomy |date=December 14, 2014 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.wsj.com/articles/a-useful-hong-kong-rebuke-1422663941 |title=A Useful Hong Kong Rebuke: China’s betrayal of its promises becomes a U.S. political issue |date=January 30, 2015 |publisher=[[The Wall Street Journal]] |accessdate=July 22, 2016}}</ref>

Smith voted against the Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act in February 2013, given its negative impact on the Trafficking in Persons Office at the State Department.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/2013-02-28_vawa_speech_congressional_record_1.pdf|title=Support VAWA Protect Human Trafficking Victims|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref> The extension nonetheless passed in the House of Representatives by a large margin.<ref>{{cite news|last=Sheets|first=Connor|title=Who Voted Against The 2013 Violence Against Women Act?

He does not support gay marriage or LGBTQ protections. Smith stated in February 2015: "I am a strong believer in traditional marriage and do not construe homosexual rights as human rights."

;Global Online Freedom Act
Since 2006, Smith has introduced versions of the [[Global Online Freedom Act]] to Congress, which is intended to prevent repressive governments from using Internet and information technologies purchased from US companies against their citizens.

;Veterans
In January 2001, Smith became chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs Committee]] and there pushed for policies opposed by the Republican leadership, including voting against the Republican and for the Democratic budget resolution because the latter included more spending on veterans programs, which resulted in his losing the chairmanship in January 2005, two years short of the normal six-year term.<ref>{{cite news|title=The Dumping of Rep. Chris Smith A hard fall from grace|url=http://articles.philly.com/2005-01-12/news/25434723_1_veterans-services-va-hospitals-veterans-population|accessdate=1 March 2013|newspaper=Philly.com|date=12 January 2005}}</ref>  In his four years, Smith's committee passed veterans bills that increased [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Veterans Affairs]] disability payments by $2.5 billion, increased G.I. Bill of Rights spending 46%, authorized $1 billion in aid to homeless veterans, and added $100 million in health care benefits for surviving spouses of veterans. Smith's 2004 bill increased from 18 to 24 months the coverage of the [[Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Act]], set up a pilot program for recruitment of nurses, and authorized a new research center of veterans with multi-trauma combat injuries.

Veterans' laws authored by Smith include one providing a record 46 percent increase in the [[GI Bill]], which helps veterans pay for college. That increase is the largest since the GI Bill went into effect following [[World War II]].

Smith also wrote the nation's first law that addresses and combats the plague of chronic homelessness among veterans. The Homeless Veterans Comprehensive Assistance Act authorizes $1 billion in programs to help veterans find and retain jobs and provides them with housing, counseling, and medical care they need to rebuild their lives.

For three years, the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]] explicitly forbade spending on Smith's four research centers to develop responses to chemical, biological and radiological attacks. In early 2003, Smith called for making veterans benefits an entitlement—mandatory spending that would not have to go through Appropriations. GOP leadership opposed and there were threats he'd lose the chair. In 2003, he voted for the Republican budget resolution that included a $1.8 billion increase in veterans spending, but in July 2003, appropriators did not include the money; Smith opposed that but disappointed Democrats by not voting against the vote sending the measure to the floor.

Smith did not expect a challenge for the chair when Congress convened in 2005. However, [[Steve Buyer]], the fourth ranking Republican on the committee, asked for an interview with the [[Steering and Policy Committee of the United States House of Representatives|Republican Steering Committee]], and on January 5, 2005 it voted to make him chairman. That decision was ratified by the Republican Conference on January 6, and Smith was removed from the committee altogether. He was obviously disappointed. "I don't look at power as something to hold. I see the power of the gavel as a strategic opportunity to do good, to use it in every way to help veterans," he said in his speech to the Conference. New Jersey Republicans expressed dismay, and New Jersey Democrats and the leaders of just about every veterans group expressed outrage.

===Controversy===
It was revealed in October 2015 that intern applicants for Smith's office were required to rate "27 different personalities, organizations and political issues to indicate whether they tend to agree with them, disagree with them or have no opinion or knowledge of them."<ref>http://www.politico.com/states/new-jersey/story/2015/10/chris-smiths-intern-applicants-rate-rachel-maddow-nra-the-pope-093706</ref> Personalities and organizations included [[Rachel Maddow]], the [[Pope]], [[Planned Parenthood]], and The National Right to Life Committee.

"I just don’t think that kids, undergraduates, ought to be subjected to what is obviously an ideological test," commented political scientist [[Russ Baker]] of [[Rutgers University]]. "There’s something about this that’s really, really troubling."

===Legislation===
On May 6, 2014, Smith introduced the bill [[International Megan's Law to Prevent Demand for Child Sex Trafficking (H.R. 4573; 113th Congress)]], which would require the notification of foreign governments when an American registered as a [[sex offender]] of children is going to be traveling to their country.<ref name=MoodyYahooMay20>{{cite news|last=Moody|first=Chris|title=House prepares for rare votes on standalone bills to curb human trafficking|url=http://news.yahoo.com/house-prepares-for-rare-votes-on-standalone-bills-to-curb-human-trafficking-142803176.html|accessdate=21 May 2014|newspaper=Yahoo!

The [http://chrissmith.house.gov/uploadedfiles/goldmanact.pdf Sean and David Goldman International Child Abduction and Return Act (Public Law 113-150)] was signed by the president on August 8, 2014. This law provides the U.S. State Department with eight escalating penalties that can be applied to foreign governments who refuse to return American children who have been abducted to their country. It is named after New Jersey resident David Goldman, who was fighting to bring his son home from Brazil for years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://chrissmith.house.gov/lawsandresolutions/the-sean-and-david-goldman-intl-child-abduction-prevention-and-return-act.htm|title=Chris Smith|website=chrissmith.house.gov|access-date=2016-10-28}}</ref>
