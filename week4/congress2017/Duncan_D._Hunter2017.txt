He is also a member of the [[Republican Study Committee]], a caucus of conservative House Republicans of which his father was a longtime member.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In a 2009 interview with [[KPBS-FM|KPBS]], Hunter expressed support for "overriding" the designation of smelt fish as an [[endangered species]], saying that overriding it would reduce unemployment in California.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep.

He opposed the [[Health Care and Education Reconciliation Act of 2010]], saying that it would "take away" the doctor-patient relationship and the right for people to choose "what type of operations they have", and that it would allow a "government bureaucrat" to make health care decisions for people. In the KPBS interview, Hunter said, "Things that you have problems with now would be exacerbated if you had government-run healthcare."<ref name=kpbs61109/>

At an April 2010 [[Tea Party movement]] rally in [[Ramona, California]], Hunter advocated for the deportation of United States citizens who are the children of illegal immigrants.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/ondeadline/post/2010/04/lawmaker-from-calif-wants-to-deport-children-of-illegal-immigrants/1|work=USA Today|title=Calif. congressman wants to deport children of illegal immigrants|date=April 28, 2010}}</ref>

At the rally, Hunter said, "It's a complex issue and...you could look and say, 'You're a mean guy. That's a mean thing to do. That's not a humanitarian thing to do' ...  We simply cannot afford what we're doing right now. We just can't afford it. California's going under." He confirmed the comments to San Diego County's ''[[North County Times]]'', telling the newspaper that he supported House Resolution 1868, a measure that called for the elimination of [[birthright citizenship in the United States]]. He expressed support for the controversial [[Arizona immigration law (2010)|2010 Arizona immigration law]], calling it a national security issue and "a fantastic starting point."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox5sandiego.com/news/kswb-hunter-calls-for-deportation,0,1239838.story|title=Congressman's call to deport children of illegals sparks firestorm|last=Ponting|first=Bob|date=April 29, 2010|publisher=Fox 5 San Diego|accessdate=February 12, 2011}}</ref>

Hunter opposed the repeal of [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell]], and advocated for delaying the repeal after it was ratified by U.S. President [[Barack Obama]].

Columnist Dan Murtaugh of the ''[[Press-Register]]'' has suggested that Hunter's 2011 call to rebid the [[littoral combat ship]] program is an attempt to get federal funds for a shipyard in his district.<ref>Murtaugh, Dan.

In 2013, Hunter accused the nation's military leaders of theatrics in the cuts that resulted from the failure of Congress to come to a deal to avert sequestration. He listed targeted spending reductions that he would prefer to make instead of the across the board cuts.<ref>{{cite news|title=Pentagon aims ax to make a point with sequester cuts, uses worst-case scenarios to force deal|author=Rowan Scarborough|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/feb/17/pentagon-aims-ax-to-make-a-point-with-cuts-worst-c/?page=all#pagebreak|newspaper=Washington Times|date=February 17, 2013|accessdate=November 21, 2016|quote=As for alternatives to postponing ship deployments, Mr. Hunter suggests cutting a Navy pet project—its Green Fleet—and stop funding the Army's $28 billion battlefield intelligence processor, which has flunked operational tests.}}</ref>

Hunter voiced concerns regarding potentially different standards for women and men for the same direct combat positions, following the Obama Administration's decision to allow women to serve in those positions.<ref>{{cite news|title=Hunter fears lax standards for women in combat|author=Rick Maze|url=http://www.armytimes.com/mobile/news/2013/03/military-lawmaker-hunter-fears-lax-standards-for-women-in-combat-030813w|newspaper=Army Times|date=March 8, 2013|accessdate=March 12, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=CONGRESS: Hunter has qualms about women in combat|author=Jeff Horseman|url=http://www.pe.com/local-news/politics/jeff-horseman-headlines/20130222-congress-hunter-has-qualms-about-women-in-combat.ece |newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]|date=February 22, 2013|accessdate=March 6, 2013}}</ref>

On December 4, 2013, Hunter commented that if war with [[Iran]] becomes inevitable, which he "sure as hell" hoped wouldn't happen, the American response should be a "massive aerial bombing campaign" including "[[Tactical nuclear weapon|tactical nuclear devices]]".<ref>{{cite news|url=http://freebeacon.com/hunter-if-you-hit-iran-do-it-with-tactical-nuclear-devices|title=Hunter: If You Hit Iran, Do It With Tactical Nuclear Devices|work=Washington Free Beacon|accessdate=2013-12-04}}</ref> He also said that the culture of Middle Easterners made them unreliable negotiating partners.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.defensenews.com/article/20131204/DEFREG02/312040017/Rep-Hunter-US-Should-Use-Tactical-Nukes-Iran-Strikes-Become-Necessary?odyssey=mod_sectionstories|title=Rep.

Hunter has strongly criticized the Army's use of its internally developed [[DCGS-A]] system for tracking battlefield intelligence. He says that an alternative technology developed by [[Palantir Technologies]] is more effective at identifying [[improvised explosive devices|IEDs]] and is preferred by Army personnel.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.theblaze.com/stories/2014/04/22/congressman-battles-army-officials-over-why-soldiers-dont-have-bomb-predicting-software|title='Matter of Life and Limb': The Congressman Who's Going to Battle With the Army Over a Software Program|last=Carter|first=Sara|date=April 22, 2014|work=The Blaze|accessdate=May 14, 2014}}</ref> He stated that if Lt.

Hunter has moved to block a plan by the military to [[Smoking in the United States military|ban sales of tobacco products on bases and ships]], indicating that he believes servicemembers should be able to make their own choices regarding use of tobacco.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.navytimes.com/article/20140507/NEWS05/305070077/Lawmakers-move-block-Navy-plan-restrict-tobacco-sales|title=Lawmakers move to block Navy plan to restrict tobacco sales|last1=Shane III|first1=Leo|date=May 7, 2014|website=www.navytimes.com|publisher=Gannett|accessdate=October 2, 2014}}</ref> In 2013, he called for the United States to train and arm Syrian rebels and stated his opinion that President Obama would be breaking the law if he bombed Syria without a Congressional mandate, and that it should be considered an impeachable offense.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.pe.com/articles/-734934--.html|title=SYRIA: Duncan Hunter visits border, urges arming opposition group|last1=Horseman|first1=Jeff|date=August 27, 2013|website=pe.com|publisher=The Press-Enterprise|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/sep/3/hunter-obama-inviting-impeachment-strikes-syria|title=Hunter: Obama inviting impeachment if he strikes Syria without Congress|last1=Dinan|first1=Stephen|date=September 3, 2013|website=washingtontimes.com|publisher=The Washington Times|accessdate=October 10, 2014}}</ref>

In February 2016, Hunter puffed on an [[electronic cigarette]] during a committee hearing, to dramatize his opposition to a proposed federal ban on such "vaping" on airplanes; however, his colleagues on the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee approved the ban.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://ktla.com/2016/02/11/republican-congressman-uses-vaporizer-during-hearing-about-use-of-device-on-airplanes|title=California Rep.

===Legislation===
Hunter introduced the [[Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4005; 113th Congress)]] into the House on February 6, 2014.<ref name=4005sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4005 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4005|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref> The bill would amend laws that govern the activities of the [[United States Coast Guard]] (USCG), the [[United States Maritime Administration|Maritime Administration]] (MARAD) within the [[United States Department of Transportation|Department of Transportation]], and the [[Federal Maritime Commission]] (FMC).<ref name=4005cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4005 – CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45168|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=April 1, 2014}}</ref>
