==Early life, education, and career==
Markey was born on July 11, 1946, in [[Malden, Massachusetts]], the son of Christina M. (née Courtney) and John E. Markey, a milkman.<ref>http://www.thecrimson.com/article/1976/11/22/ed-markey-the-milkmans-son-who/</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/bostonherald/access/56441073.html?FMT=ABS | work=Boston Herald | title=Obituary; John E.

Markey, congressman's mother | date=July 24, 1998}}</ref> The family was [[Irish Catholic]], and Markey was educated at Immaculate Conception School and [[Malden Catholic High School]]. He graduated from [[Boston College]] in 1968 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]], and from [[Boston College Law School]] in 1972 with a [[Juris Doctor]].<ref name="cong-bio">{{cite web| url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=m000133 | work=[[Biographical Directory of the United States Congress]] | title=Markey, Edward John |publisher=[[United States Congress]]}}</ref> After graduating, Markey worked as a lawyer in private practice.

Markey served in the [[United States Army Reserve]] from 1968 to 1973, attaining the rank of [[Specialist (rank)|Specialist Fourth Class]]. He joined while a junior in college, and has stated that he enlisted before receiving a [[Vietnam War]] draft notice. He further stated that even though he opposed the war, if he had been drafted without having secured a position in the Reserve, he would have answered the induction notice and gone to [[Vietnam]]. Ed Markey's [[South Boston, Massachusetts|South Boston]] unit included [[Thomas P. O'Neill III]], [[Steve Grossman (politician)|Steve Grossman]], and Markey's brothers Richard and John. Markey was discharged in 1973, a year before his enlistment agreement was due to expire, which was not unusual as the military discharged many members early during post-Vietnam force drawdowns.<ref>Noah Bierman, Boston Globe, [http://www.bostonglobe.com/news/nation/2013/04/20/markey-rode-anti-vietnam-post-watergate-yearnings-seat-congress/geRkNb4wX1HRtZElFpXpgI/story.html A Drive That Stunned Markey’s Family, and Never Ebbed: Representative Came in as a Rebel, Then Rose], April 21, 2013</ref><ref>Curt Nickisch, WBUR Radio, [http://www.wbur.org/2013/04/24/edward-markey-senate-profile Markey, U.S. Congressman For 36 Years, Sets His Sights On The Senate], April 24, 2013</ref><ref>Emily O'Donnell, Attleboro Sun-Chronicle, [http://www.thesunchronicle.com/election/faithful-embrace-markey-at-victory-party/article_23f2ae8e-a9f5-5f38-8ebb-da77c861f0f1.html Faithful Embrace Markey at Victory Party], May 1, 2013</ref><ref>William E.

Markey was elected to the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]], where he represented the 16th [[Middlesex County, Massachusetts|Middlesex]] district ([[Malden, Massachusetts|Malden]] and [[Melrose, Massachusetts|Melrose]]) from 1973 to 1976.<ref name="cong-bio" /><ref>{{cite book |title=Public Officers of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts |volume=1973, 1975 |url=http://archives.lib.state.ma.us/handle/2452/40890/browse?type=dateissued  |publisher=[[Massachusetts General Court]]}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
[[File:Ed Markey 101st Congress portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|left|Markey in the [[101st United States Congress]] (1989)]]
On May 21, 1976, incumbent Congressman [[Torbert Macdonald]] died in office. Markey, who had just been elected to a third term in the state house, entered a seven-candidate Democratic primary for what was then the [[Massachusetts's 7th congressional district|7th District]]  In the primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—Markey won the nomination with a plurality of 22% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=374833 |title=MA District 07 - D Primary Race - Sep 14, 1976 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> In the November 1976 election, he defeated Republican Richard Daly 77-18%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=32052 |title=MA District 07 - Special Election Race - Nov 02, 1976 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> That election also doubled as a special election for the balance of Macdonald's term, and so Markey took office later that night. This gave him greater seniority than other Representatives elected in 1976.

Markey has been challenged in a Democratic primary 3 times; in 1980 when he won 85%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=756685 |title=MA District 07 - D Primary Race - Sep 16, 1980 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> in 1984 when he won 54%,<ref name="ourcampaigns.com">{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=501530 |title=MA District 7 - D Primary Race - Sep 18, 1984 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref> and in 2002 when he won 85%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1455 |title=MA District 7 - D Primary Race - Sep 17, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=February 19, 2014}}</ref>

Markey was re-elected 19 more times from this district, which included most of the northern suburbs of [[Boston]]. His lowest vote total was 62% in 1992, in a three-way election. Markey faced no Republican opposition in his bids for re-election 8 times, in 1978, 1980, 1986–90, 2000, 2002, and 2006.<ref name="clerk">{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |title=Office of the House Clerk – Electoral Statistics |publisher=Clerk of the United States House of Representatives |accessdate=January 5, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730201058/http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electionInfo/index.html |archivedate=July 30, 2008 |df=mdy }}</ref><ref name="fedelect">{{cite web|url=http://www.fec.gov/pubrec/electionresults.shtml|title=Election Results|publisher=[[Federal Election Commission]]|accessdate=January 5, 2013}}</ref>  His district was renumbered the 5th after the 2010 census, in which Massachusetts lost a district.

====Environment and energy====
In December 2007, Markey became the first US politician to use [[Second Life]], through which he addressed the delegates of the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change|UNFCCC]] in [[Bali]] as part of [[OneClimate]]'s Virtual Bali event.

Markey sarcastically suggested in August 2010 that [[climate change denial|global warming deniers]] form their own country on an iceberg: “An iceberg four times the size of Manhattan has broken off Greenland, creating plenty of room for global warming deniers to start their own country.” Markey also said that, at the time, 2010 was the hottest recorded year, and "scientists agree arctic ice is a canary in a coal mine that provides clear warnings on climate”.<ref name="Start country">{{cite news|title=Markey: Deniers of global warming should 'start their own country'|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/113171-markey-global-warming-deniers-should-start-their-own-country-on-giant-ice-island-|newspaper=The Hill|date=7 August 2010}}</ref><ref name=Skeptics>{{cite news|title=MA pol: warming skeptics should move to ice island|url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2010/08/07/ma_pol_warming_skeptics_should_move_to_ice_island/'|newspaper=Boston|date=7 August 2010|deadurl=yes}} {{Dead link|date=April 2014|bot=RjwilmsiBot}}</ref> Markey has derided Republicans' stance on global warming, stating during a hearing: "I won’t physically rise, because I’m worried that Republicans will overturn the law of gravity, sending us floating about the room.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thinkprogress.org/climate/2011/03/10/174942/markey-flat-earthers/?mobile=nc | title=During Climate Hearing, Markey Asks If Anti-Science GOP Will Repeal Gravity, Heliocentrism, Relativity | date=March 10, 2011 | accessdate=September 24, 2012}}</ref>

====Domestic issues====
Markey was one of the 31 members of the House who voted not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral vote]]s from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 Presidential election]]; without Ohio's votes [[John Kerry]] would have been elected President.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml Final Vote Results for Roll Call 7].
