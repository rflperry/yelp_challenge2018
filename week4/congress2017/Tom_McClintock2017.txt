He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes behind Westley, who won with a plurality of 45.3% of the vote.

;2008
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2008#District 4}}
On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[California's 4th congressional district]], which is hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican [[John Doolittle]], decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the [[California Constitution]] required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term. Furthermore, in order to vote using a ballot in regards to a specific congressional district, one must live within that district. Because Thousand Oaks is outside of California's Fourth Congressional District, McClintock was thus ineligible to vote for himself.<ref name="SacBee030408"/>

Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans [[Rico Oller]] and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock.<ref name="SacBee030408">{{cite news|author=Hecht, Peter |title=McClintock in, Oller out in race to replace Doolittle |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=2008-03-04 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/759440.html |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206125635/http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/759440.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Gunzberger, Ronecemb|title=California|work=Politics1.com|date=2008-03-05|url=http://www.politics1.com/blog-0308.htm#0305|accessdate=2008-03-05}}</ref> McClintock was endorsed by the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]],<ref>[http://www.rlc.org/2008/11/05/rlc-election-results/ "RLC Election Results." Republican Liberty Caucus (November 5, 2008).]</ref> [[Club for Growth]], and U.S. Congressman [[Ron Paul]]. McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman [[Doug Ose]], a moderate represented the neighboring [[California's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]] from 1999 to 2005. Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a [[carpetbagger]] and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54%–39%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=341896|title=Our Campaigns – CA District 04 – R Primary Race – Jun 03, 2008|work=ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

The Democratic nominee was retired [[Usaf|Air Force]] [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Charles Brown (California)|Charlie Brown]], who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the [[California State Senate]], despite the fact that he lived in [[Elk Grove, California|Elk Grove]], near Sacramento, for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in [[Thousand Oaks, California|Thousand Oaks]], in his State Senate district. He stated, "Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mcclintock23mar23,0,6751476.story|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Patrick|last=McGreevy|title=McClintock criticized for taking per diem housing allowance|date=March 23, 2008}}</ref> However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent in home in the 19th district, but uses his mother's address. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband.<ref>[http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/963198.html Politics – Ballot Watch: "Ose's attack on McClintock for taking per diem riles rival's wife"], ''[[Sacramento Bee]]''</ref> McClintock ran ads attacking Brown’s participation at a 2005 protest by [[Code Pink]], an infamous [[anti-war]] group, and argued Brown supported [[Gay marriage in California|gay marriage]] but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].<ref name="nationaljournal.com"/>

By November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from [[El Dorado County]] shortly after [[Thanksgiving]]. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in [[Placer County]], the largest county in the district. Brown won just three of the district's nine districts: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%).<ref>[http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2008_general/23_34_us_reps.pdf "United States Representative (final results)"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081221042514/http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/sov/2008_general/23_34_us_reps.pdf |date=December 21, 2008 }} Office of the California Secretary of State, Retrieved on December 26, 2008</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theunion.com/article/20081122/NEWS/811220440/1066&ParentProfile=1053&title=McClintock%20declares%20victory|title=McClintock declares victory|work=The Union}}</ref>
