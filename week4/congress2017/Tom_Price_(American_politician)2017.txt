===Elections===
[[File:Tom Price original.jpg|thumb|left|100px|Price in 2005]]
;2004
In 2004, U.S. Congressman [[Johnny Isakson]] of [[Georgia's 6th congressional district]] decided not to run for re-election in order to run for the U.S. Senate. No [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] even filed, meaning that whoever won the Republican primary would be virtually assured of being the district's next congressman. The 6th district was so heavily Republican that any Democratic candidate would have faced nearly impossible odds in any event. Six other Republican candidates filed to run, most notably state senators Robert Lamutt and Chuck Clay. Price was the only major candidate from [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton County]], while Lamutt and Clay were both from [[Cobb County]]. On July 20, 2004, Price ranked first with 35% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win the Republican nomination. Lamutt qualified for the run-off, ranking second with 28% of the vote. Price won two of the district's three counties: [[Fulton County, Georgia|Fulton]] with 63% and [[Cherokee County, Georgia|Cherokee]] with 35%. Lamutt carried [[Cobb County, Georgia|Cobb]] with 31% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4653|title= GA - District 06 - R Primary Race - Jul 20, 2004|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref> In the August 10 run-off election, Price defeated Lamutt 54%–46%. They split the vote in Cherokee, but Price carried Fulton by a landslide of 79% of the vote. Lamutt couldn't eliminate that deficit as he won Cobb with just 59% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=114737|title=GA District 06 - R Runoff Race - Aug 10, 2004|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref> Price won the general election unopposed.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4101|title= GA - District 06 Race - Nov 02, 2004|publisher=Our Campaigns|accessdate=November 19, 2016}}</ref>

===Legislation===
[[File:Tom Price by Gage Skidmore 2.jpg|left|thumb|Price speaking on a panel about healthcare at the 2014 Conservative Political Action Conference]]
Price is the sponsor of the [[Empowering Patients First Act]] (EPFA), which he first introduced in the 111th Congress and has reintroduced in each Congress since then. Originally intended to be a Republican alternative to Democratic efforts to reform the health care system, it has since been positioned by Price and other Republicans as a potential replacement to the PPACA. The bill, among other things, creates and expands tax credits for purchasing health insurance, allows for some interstate health insurance markets, and reforms medical malpractice lawsuits.

Price introduced the [[Pro-Growth Budgeting Act of 2013 (H.R. 1874; 113th Congress)]] on May 8, 2013.<ref name=1874sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1874|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref> The bill would require the [[Congressional Budget Office]] to provide a macroeconomic impact analysis for bills that are estimated to have a large budgetary effect.<ref name=1874cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 1874 – CBO|url=http://cbo.gov/publication/45213|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=March 28, 2014}}</ref> Price said it was necessary because of the Congressional Budget Office's current method of reviewing bills just to see what they would cost.
