Forbes is the current Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee's Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee, which exercises oversight and legislative jurisdiction over the US Navy, US Marine Corps, US Air Force bomber and mobility (e.g., aerial refueling and airlift) assets, Navy Reserve equipment, and maritime programs. Before his appointment to this position in 2013, he was Chairman of the HASC Readiness subcommittee during the 112th Congress.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2012, he organized a nationwide listening tour titled "Defending Our Defenders" which was aimed at bringing public awareness to the looming impact of sequestration on national defense. Forbes voted against the measure, which he believes threatens to dismantle the military and lead to massive civilian and military layoffs. Forbes has been a longtime proponent for a substantially expanded U.S. Navy. He is critical of the Navy's current 30 Year Shipbuilding Plan, which he believes fails to adequately invest in the ships needed to meet the service's current minimum force structure requirements. In April 2013, he presented an extended argument for why the U.S. must maintain a robust Navy, in which he criticized the lack of funding that had allowed the Navy to slip below the 300-ship threshold.{{cn|date=November 2016}} 

A strong supporter of sustained U.S. engagement in the Asia Pacific, in July 2013, Forbes and three colleagues wrote a letter to National Security Advisor [[Susan Rice]], asking the White House to develop an coherent strategy document for its implementation. For his work on behalf of the Armed Services and the men and women who wear the uniform, the Army and Navy have presented their highest civilian awards to the Congressman.{{Citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In 2013, Forbes publicly opposed military action in both Libya and Syria.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://forbes.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=347488 |title=Forbes Releases Statement Opposing Intervention in Syria - Congressman J.

In 2014, Forbes voted to address cuts imposed by [[United States budget sequestration in 2013|sequestration]] with a $1.4 billion cut to operations, maintenance, and training funds, rather than mothballing 11 cruisers and three amphibious warships.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://breakingdefense.com/2014/05/hasc-debates-sequesters-terrible-dilemma-a-ready-force-or-a-large-one|title=HASC Debates Sequestration's ‘Terrible Dilemma’: A Ready Force Or A Large One|last1=Freedberg Jr.|first1=Sydney J.|website=breakingdefense.com|publisher=Breaking Media, Inc.|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}</ref>

===Veterans===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
Forbes’ district is home to 70,000+ veterans, who make up roughly 10% of his constituency. Forbes has been recognized year in and year out by various veteran organizations for his help to bring veterans’ needs to the forefront of public discourse. Forbes was awarded the prestigious AMVET's Silver Helmet award in 2013, and was named "Legislator of the Year" by Virginia's MOAA in 2012. VA claims, healthcare, education, and veteran employment are the major issues which Forbes has focused much of his time in Washington on.

===China===
Forbes is founder and chairman of the Congressional China Caucus, which takes special interest in the emergence of China as a political, economic and military actor on both the regional and global stage.<ref>{{cite web|title = About the Caucus|url = https://forbes.house.gov/chinacaucus/about.htm|website = forbes.house.gov|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> As one of Congress’ scholars on Chinese issues, Forbes keynoted a panel discussion at [[Harvard University]] in the April 2012 to discuss the implementation of US strategy to China's world power emergence.<ref>{{cite web|title = Forbes to Speak Tomorrow at Harvard on U.S.-China Relations|url = http://forbes.house.gov/updates/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=289736|website = forbes.house.gov|access-date = 2016-01-22}}</ref> Congressman Forbes has voiced concern for Chinese military ambition, cyber threats, contaminated exports, and human rights violations. His reputation has come under scrutiny with the recent acquisition of America's largest pork company, [[Smithfield Foods]], by a Chinese competitor – a company headquartered within his district. This $4.7 billion deal is the biggest Chinese acquisition of a U.S. company to date.<ref>{{cite web|title = Who's behind the Chinese takeover of world's biggest pork producer?|url = http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/whos-behind-chinese-takeover-worlds-biggest-pork-producer/|website = PBS NewsHour|access-date = 2016-01-22|language = en-US}}</ref>

===Government accountability===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
Forbes has introduced or cosponsored several pieces of legislation, which aim to hold government more accountable. He is one of only seventeen members of congress to vote against every federal bailout under both the Bush and Obama administrations. Though a staunch supporter of national defense, he has also called for a full audit of both the Department of Defense and Federal Reserve. Furthermore, Forbes has introduced a balanced budget amendment, and CAP Act to tie members of Congress’ salaries to spending.
The revelation that the National Security Agency was abusing intelligence gathering powers provided them under the PATRIOT and FISA acts, Forbes cosponsored bipartisan legislation which enacts greater accountability and oversight over the agency's intelligence gathering techniques.

===Religious freedom===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=November 2016}}
As Founder and Co-Chairman of the bicameral [http://forbes.house.gov/pages/congressional-prayer-caucus.htm Congressional Prayer Caucus], Congressman Forbes, and co-chairman Senator Lankford, lead more than 90 Members of Congress in protecting the free exercise of religion as a fundamental human right essential to a free society.

===Energy independence===
On June 12, 2008 Forbes introduced H.R. 6260, titled "[[New Manhattan Project for Energy Independence]]". The bill was offered as a substitute for the entire energy bill and outlined a series of prizes, similar to the [[X-PRIZE]], which would be awarded to a private entity, which completed one of seven tasks related to achieving energy independence. 

The bill included $14 billion in prizes and $10 billion in grants ($10 billion of which would have supported [[nuclear fusion]] research); provisions to establish a summit to discuss the challenge of energy independence; and creation of a commission to offer recommendations to fulfill the goal of becoming energy independent within 20 years. On June 26, 2009, the bill was offered as an amendment in the nature of a substitute for the Waxman/Markey-sponsored [[American Clean Energy and Security Act]]. The amendment was rejected by the House of Representatives 255–172.<ref>{{cite news|last=Bartel|first=Bill|title=Forbes' GOP alternative to climate bill shot down|url=http://hamptonroads.com/2009/06/forbes-gop-alternative-climate-bill-shot-down|newspaper=The Virginian-Pilot|date=June 27, 2009}}</ref>
