'''John Mondy Shimkus''' (born February 21, 1958) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|IL|15}}, since 1997. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life, education and career==
Shimkus is a lifelong resident of [[Collinsville, Illinois|Collinsville]], part of the [[St. Louis]] [[Greater St. Louis|metropolitan area]], its [[Metro East]] portion. He is the son of Kathleen N. (née Mondy) and Gene L. Shimkus. His paternal grandfather was of [[Lithuania]]n descent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/shimkus.htm |title=shimkus |publisher=Freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref> While in the Army, he earned the [[Expert Infantry Badge]], [[Ranger tab]], and [[Parachutist Badge (United States)|Parachutist Badge]] as well as served overseas with the [[54th Infantry Regiment (United States)|54th Infantry Regiment]] in [[West Germany]].<ref name="AUSA2011">{{cite web |url=http://www.ausa.org/legislation/congressionalinfo/Documents/OAS%20112th%20Congress.pdf |title=Once a Soldier... Always a Soldier |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |year=2011 |work=Legislative Agenda |publisher=[[Association of the United States Army]] |accessdate=27 January 2013}}</ref>

He first ran for office in 1989, when he was elected a [[Collinsville Township, Madison County, Illinois|Collinsville Township]] trustee. A year later, he was elected as [[Madison County, Illinois|Madison County]] treasurer—the first Republican elected to a countywide post in 10 years.  In 1994, he became the first Republican to be re-elected as county treasurer in 60 years.

==Political positions==

===Food safety===
Shimkus has been a proponent of legislation to increase the ability of the Food and Drug Administration to institute recalls of tainted foods. He has served as one of the chief Republican negotiators on the FDA Food Safety Modernization Act, which was recently passed by the U.S. House of Representatives. Of the bill, he said: "When you're talking about the health and safety of folks, if the FDA has enough evidence to make a declaration of recall, I think that most Americans would support the government having that authority."<ref name="food safety"/>

===Climate change===
Shimkus rejects the human-induced theory of climate change and opposes [[emissions trading]] legislation. On March 25, 2009, in introductory remarks made to [[Christopher Monckton, 3rd Viscount Monckton of Brenchley]], during a [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Environment]] hearing, he made the following statement regarding the role of [[carbon dioxide]] in [[global warming]]: <blockquote>It's plant food ... So if we decrease the use of carbon dioxide, are we not taking away plant food from the atmosphere? ... So all our good intentions could be for naught. In fact, we could be doing just the opposite of what the people who want to save the world are saying.<ref name="capping co2">{{cite web |url=http://www.progressillinois.com/2009/3/27/shimkus-carbon-emissions-plant-food|title=Shimkus: Capping C02 Emissions Will "Take Away Plant Food"|accessdate=2009-04-16|date=2009-03-27|publisher=Progress Illinois|author=Doster, Adam}}</ref></blockquote>

Shimkus has quoted the Bible to allay concerns of global warming induced rise in sea levels, stating that God had promised mankind through Noah that the earth would never again be destroyed by a flood.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/44958.html |title=John Shimkus cites Genesis on climate change - Darren Samuelsohn |publisher=Politico.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref> He acknowledged that climate change is real, but questioned the benefit of spending taxpayer money on something that cannot be changed versus the changes that have been occurring forever. Specifically, Shimkus said, "“Now, do I believe in climate change? In my trip to Greenland, the answer is yes. The climate is changing. The question is more about the costs and benefits and trying to spend taxpayer dollars on something that you cannot stop versus the changes that have been occurring forever. That's the real debate."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1328366/John-Shimkus-Global-warming-wont-destroy-planet-God-promised-Noah.html | work=Daily Mail | title='The planet won't be destroyed by global warming because God promised Noah,' says politician bidding to chair U.S. energy committee | location=London | date=November 10, 2010}}</ref>

===Keystone pipeline===
{{main article|Keystone pipeline}}

In May 2013, Shimkus stated he would renew his support for the [[Keystone pipeline]]. The project would be an oil pipeline, bringing Canadian [[crude oil]] through the Midwest, including Illinois. As a supporter, he stated that he would rather see Canada as an energy partner than ship in oil from overseas.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://stlouis.cbslocal.com/2013/05/31/illinois-reps-shimkus-and-davis-renew-push-for-keystone-pipeline/ |title=Illinois Reps.

===2006 Mark Foley scandal===
[[File:John Shimkus, official photo portrait color.jpg|thumb|right|Earlier official photo of Shimkus]]
{{main article|Mark Foley scandal}}

Shimkus said "that in late-2005 he learned—through information passed along by Alexander's office—about an e-mail exchange in which Foley asked about the youngster's well-being after [[Hurricane Katrina]] and requested a photograph."<ref name="pageconcerned">{{cite news | url=http://blogs.abcnews.com/theblotter/2006/09/sixteenyearold_.html | title=Sixteen-Year-Old Who Worked as Capitol Hill Page Concerned About E-mail Exchange with Congressman | publisher=The Blotter, [[ABC News]] | date=September 28, 2006 | accessdate = 2006-10-05}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
In 1992, while still serving as Madison County treasurer, he won the Republican nomination in what was then the 20th District. He was defeated by 10-year [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[incumbent]] [[Dick Durbin]].

Four years later, Durbin gave up the seat to make what would be a successful run for the [[United States Senate]]. Shimkus won a crowded six-way primary, and faced [[Illinois House of Representatives|State Representative]] [[Jay C. Hoffman]] in a close general election, which Shimkus won by just over 1,200 votes.

He has only faced one credible Democratic opponent since his initial reelection, in 2002. That year, Illinois lost a district as a result of the 2000 census, and his district was merged with the 19th District of two-term Democratic representative [[David D. Phelps]]. The new district retained Phelps' district number, but geographically and demographically was more Shimkus' district, as he retained 60 percent of his former territory. The campaign was very bitter, with both men accusing the other's staffers of stalking their families.<ref name="stay close"/> Despite a Democratic wave that swept through most of the state, he was easily reelected.

Shimkus announced in September 2005, that he would run for reelection in 2008, despite making a pledge<ref name="pledge">[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/1285.html] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929205206/http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/external/pre-election/bios/1285.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}</ref> when first elected in 1996 not to stay in office for more than 12 years.

When seeking his 11th term in 2016, Shimkus faced a Tea Party challenger in the Republican primary, who criticized his accommodation with the Obama administration as well as national Republican party leadership, but won.<ref>{{cite web|last=Donaldedonald |first=Elizabeth |url=http://www.bnd.com/news/politics-government/article66291932.html |title=Shimkus holds off challenge from McCarter; Vandersand concedes to Davis &#124; Belleville News-Democrat |website=Bnd.com |date=2016-03-15 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Greenfield |first=Jeff |url=http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-score/2016/03/shimkus-among-three-house-incumbent-primaries-to-watch-tuesday-emilys-list-dominating-maryland-senate-race-senate-spending-vote-drama-in-ohio-213186 |title=Shimkus among three House incumbent primaries to watch Tuesday |website=Politico.com |date=2015-12-31 |accessdate=2016-04-14}}</ref>

FEC records show that the John S. Fund, the PAC for Shimkus, contributed to former Republican House Majority Leader [[Tom DeLay]] in 2005. The fund also made contributions to [[Peter Roskam]], a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 6th district, from 2005 to 2008 and to [[David McSweeney (politician)|David McSweeney]], a Republican candidate for the House from Illinois's 8th district, in 2006.<ref name="query">{{cite web|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/com_supopp/C00390831/ |title=Committees and Candidates Supported/Opposed |publisher=Query.nictusa.com |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref><ref name="query1">{{cite web|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H6IL06117 |title=Committees Who Gave To This Candidate |publisher=Query.nictusa.com |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref><ref name="query2">{{cite web|url=http://query.nictusa.com/cgi-bin/can_give/H8IL08044 |title=Committees Who Gave To This Candidate |publisher=Query.nictusa.com |accessdate=2015-03-15}}</ref> Recently the funds treasurer, lobbyist Mark Valente, resigned. Shimkus earlier said he was considering removing Valente, but he didn't want to act too quickly because it might suggest there was something improper about their relationship.<ref name="lobbyist">Meinert, Dori. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927001051/http://www.sj-r.com/sections/news/stories/80614.asp |date=September 27, 2007 |title=Lobbyist who raised funds for Shimkus resigns }}, [[The State Journal-Register]], March 9, 2006</ref>

==Electoral history==
The {{ushr|Illinois|20|20th district}} was disbanded after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 census]], which is why Shimkus faced [[David D. Phelps]], incumbent of the 19th district, in the 2002 election. The 19th district was disbanded after the [[2010 United States Census|2010 census]], so Shimkus ran in the redistricted 15th district. The district includes much of the southern portion of the state, including a portion of the [[Metro-East]], which is the Illinois side of the [[St. Louis]] area.
