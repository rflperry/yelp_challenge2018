==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{Main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2010#District 1}}
In 2009, Gosar – who had never run for elected office before – announced he would challenge [[U.S. Democratic Party|Democratic]] incumbent [[Ann Kirkpatrick]] in the 1st district in the 2010 elections. Gosar has been identified as a [[Tea party movement|Tea Party candidate]] by ''[[The New York Times]]'' because the Arizona Tea Party features Gosar on its website.<ref>{{cite news|last=Zernike|first=Kate|url=http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2010/10/15/us/politics/tea-party-graphic.html|title=Where Tea Party Candidates Are Running |publisher=The New York Times|date=October 14, 2010|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Libertarian nominee Nicole Patti was also on the ballot.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Gosar won the Republican primary. He was endorsed by [[Sarah Palin]] and three Arizona county sheriffs: Maricopa County sheriff, [[Joe Arpaio]], Coconino County sheriff, Joe Richards, and Pinal County sheriff, [[Paul Babeu]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosarforcongress.com/endorsements|title=Endorsements |publisher=Gosar For Congress|accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> Kirkpatrick challenged him to five debates across the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.prescottenews.com/?option=com_content&task=view&id=3884|title=Paul Gosar Finds Easy Victory in CD1 Primary|publisher=Prescott eNews|date=2010-08-26|accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://azcapitoltimes.com/news/2010/08/26/kirkpatrick-wants-5-debates-with-gop-challenger|title=Arizona Capitol Times Blog Archive » Kirkpatrick wants 5 debates with GOP challenger|publisher=Azcapitoltimes.com|accessdate=2010-10-19}}</ref> Gosar initially agreed to one debate but later withdrew. Gosar released a statement explaining the decision to withdraw from the debate was based on the long drive to and from [[KAET]] in Phoenix, which organized the debate.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.azdailysun.com/news/local/article_1b2c982f-ebef-52d6-891b-24f7ee485fb5.html|title=Gosar pulls plug on televised debate|publisher=Arizona Daily Sun|date=2010-10-19|accessdate=2010-10-20}}</ref> A producer at KAET said Gosar's staff told the station the candidate could not participate in the debate because he would be attending a fundraiser instead.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://prescottdailycourier.com/main.asp?SectionID=1&SubSectionID=1&ArticleID=86518|title=Gosar backs out of today's TV debate in favor of fundraiser|publisher=Prescott Daily Courier|date=2010-10-20|accessdate=2010-10-21}}</ref>

;2012
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in Arizona, 2012#District 4}}
Following changes made in [[redistricting]], Gosar was going to seek re-election in the 1st district, which was made less favorable to Republicans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|title=House Democrats Gain With New Arizona Map|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011|work=[[National Journal]]|first=Jessica|last=Taylor}}</ref>  However, with Kirkpatrick priming for a rematch, Gosar changed his mind and announced in January 2012 he would run in the newly created [[Arizona's 4th congressional district|4th district]], which is heavily Republican.  As part of the move, he bought a second home in [[Prescott, Arizona|Prescott]], which he claimed as his official residence.<ref>{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Reid|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2012/01/gosar-will-swit.php|title=Gosar Will Switch Districts|publisher=National Journal|date=January 7, 2012|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

Gosar initially faced a tough primary fight against Babeu. However, Babeu pulled out in May 2012 due to allegations of abuse of power.<ref>[http://latino.foxnews.com/latino/politics/2012/05/11/sheriff-babeu-abandons-race-for-arizona-congressional-seat/ Sheriff Babeu Abandons Race for Arizona Congressional Seat].

===Tenure===

====Abortion====
Paul Gosar describes himself as [[pro-life]]. On abortions, Gosar states, “These procedures undeniably rob the world of a human life in a most cruel fashion... The right thing to do is to ban these procedures.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gosar.house.gov/press-release/dr-gosar-condemns-abortion-genocide-disgusted-congress%E2%80%99-failure-protect-unborn-and-ban |title=Dr. Gosar Condemns Abortion Genocide: Disgusted at Congress’ Failure to Protect the Unborn and Ban Pain Capable Abortions |publisher=Gosar.house.gov |date=July 31, 2012 |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> These beliefs are reflected in his voting record. Gosar cosponsored the [[No Taxpayer Funding for Abortion Act]], a bill that would make permanent restrictions on federal funding of abortions in the US.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR00003:@@@L&summ2=m& |title=Bill Summary & Status – 112th Congress (2011 – 2012) – H.R.3 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Gosar also cosponsored the District of Columbia Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, an act placing restrictions on abortions in the [[District of Columbia]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR03803:@@@L&summ2=m& |title=Bill Summary & Status – 112th Congress (2011 – 2012) – H.R.3803 – All Information – THOMAS (Library of Congress) |publisher=Thomas.loc.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Gosar was given a 100% rating by the [[National Right to Life Committee]], a pro-life interest group, and a 0% rating by [[NARAL]] (National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League), a pro-choice interest group.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/evaluations/123491/paul-gosar#.UKrGv4eUZH4 |title=Paul Gosar – Ratings and Endorsements |publisher=Project Vote Smart |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

====Gun rights====
Gosar has stated that the “[[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] is one of the most important rights set forth by the [[Bill of Rights]]” and has stated he will “continue to oppose efforts to restrict, infringe, or remove this constitutionally protected right.”<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gosar.house.gov/issue/second-amendment-gun-rights |title=Second Amendment Gun Rights |publisher=Gosar.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> Gosar cosponsored the National Right-to-Carry Reciprocity Act of 2011, a bill that would allow noncitizens of a state to, with [[concealed carry]] permits, carry concealed weapons in that state.<ref>{{cite web|author=Rep.

====Immigration====
Regarding immigration, Gosar has stated, "I strongly believe we need to immediately secure our border and oppose [[amnesty]] for anyone who blatantly violates our law."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.gosarforcongress.com|title=Gosar for Congress|publisher=gosarforcongress.com|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref> He has cosponsored multiple bills that would impose regulations on immigration. For example, Gosar cosponsored the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011, a bill that would eliminate [[birthright citizenship]] for children born in the US to undocumented immigrants.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.opencongress.org/bill/112-h140/show|title=H.R.140: Birthright Citizenship Act of 2011 – U.S. Congress|publisher=OpenCongress|accessdate=2012-12-18}}</ref>

====Native Americans====
In December 2014, Gosar drew controversy when he referred to American Indians as "wards of the federal government".  He was responding to concerns from members of the [[Fort Apache Indian Reservation]] in eastern Arizona when he made the comment that stunned people at the round-table talk in Flagstaff, Arizona.  The topic had addressed the proposal to swap 2,400 acres of southeastern Arizona's [[Tonto National Forest]] for about 5,300 acres of environmentally sensitive land.  The proposal, which was attached as a [[Rider (legislation)|rider]] to the 2015 [[National Defense Authorization Act]], would give land sacred to the Apache in Arizona to [[Resolution Copper]] Mine, a joint venture owned by [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]] and [[BHP Billiton]].  [[Troy Eid]], a Republican and former U.S. Attorney in Colorado, responded to Gosar's comments and said: "In the heated context of what this represents, it's especially inappropriate to be resorting to what amounts to race baiting."  A Gosar spokesperson said his comments were misconstrued.<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/12/10/paul-gosar-native-americans_n_6305738.html |title=Rep. Paul Gosar Calls Native Americans 'Wards Of The Federal Government' |newspaper=Huffington Post |first1=Felicia |last1=Fonseca |date=December 10, 2014 |accessdate=January 25, 2015}}</ref>

====Finance====
In 2010 Gosar signed a pledge sponsored by [[Americans for Prosperity]] promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.<ref>[http://americansforprosperity.org/files/Gosar_Paul.pdf ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}</ref>

====Attempt to Impeach EPA Administrator====
On September 11, 2015, Gosar announced that he had filed articles of impeachment against [[EPA]] administrator Gina McCarthy for "high crimes and misdemeanors:", claiming that she had "lied to the American people in order to force misguided and overreaching regulations, which have no scientific basis, down our throats.".<ref>Smith, Steven [http://gosar.house.gov/press-release/rep-gosar-files-articles-impeachment-against-epa-administrator-gina-mccarthy, "Rep. Gosar Files Articles of Impeachment against EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy"], House.gov Press Release, September 11, 2015. Retrieved September 22, 2015</ref> An EPA spokeswoman said Gosar's resolution "has zero merit and is nothing more than political theater" while fellow Republican and House majority leader, [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] confirmed that “There’s no plan to impeach Gina McCarthy." <ref>[http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/09/15/gop-lawmaker-moves-to-impeach-epa-chief-mccarthy/, "GOP lawmaker moves to impeach EPA chief McCarthy"], Fox News, September 15, 2015, Retrieved September 22, 2015.</ref>

====Boycott of Pope Francis====
On September 17, 2015, in an [[op-ed]] on the conservative website [[Townhall.com]], Gosar announced that he would not attend [[Pope Francis|Pope Francis']] planned address to Congress, unless the Pope spoke about issues such as "violent Islam" or [[Planned Parenthood]], instead of [[global warming]]. While he stated that he remains proud to be a Catholic and to have attended a [[Jesuit]] university, where he learned to "think critically [and] welcome debate and discussion," nonetheless, he would treat the Pope the same way he believes "leftist politicians" should be treated.

Fearing the possibility the Pope would discuss [[climate change]], he said "I will not attend."<ref name=time>{{cite news|title=Why I Am Boycotting Pope Francis’s Address to Congress|url=http://time.com/4040743/paul-gosar-pope-francis-congress|website=TIME.com|accessdate=2015-09-18|first=Paul Gosar/Town|last=Hall}}</ref> According to Gosar, Pope Francis had “adopted all of the socialist talking points, wrapped false science and ideology into ‘climate justice’ and is being presented to guilt people into leftist policies,”<ref>Viebeck, Elise, [http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2015/09/21/who-is-paul-gosar-the-congressman-boycotting-pope-francis/ "Who is Paul Gosar, the congressman boycotting Pope Francis?"], 'Washington Post', September 21, 2015; retrieved September 22, 2015.</ref> and  ''[[Laudato si']]'', Francis's encyclical on the environment, had been "written with the consultation of that great seminary the EPA and its embattled head Gina McCarthy."<ref name=time/> Gosar did not attend Pope Francis's September 24 address, the only member of Congress to do so;<ref name=fundraising>{{cite web|url=http://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/arizona-news/27036260-story|title=Gosar goes after Pope; uses boycott to raise campaign money|last1=Flores|first1=Jessica|date=September 30, 2015|website=fox10phoenix.com|publisher=[[KSAZ-TV]]|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref> the gesture generated comment on television and the Internet.<ref name=post>{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/09/30/arizona-congressman-raises-funds-off-his-boycott-of-pope-francis|title=Arizona congressman raises funds off his boycott of Pope Francis|last1=Weigel|first1=Dave|date=September 30, 2015|website=washingtonpost.com|publisher=''[[Washington Post]]''|accessdate=July 10, 2016}}</ref>

Shortly after the Pope's visit, Gosar sent out a fundraising email that focused on his recent action. The message repeated, four times, the Townhall op-ed's catchphrase, "When the Pope chooses to act and talk like a leftist politician, then he can expect to be treated like one." Citing criticism from [[Stephen Colbert]], an article in [[Salon.com]], and an unnamed website, the message positioned Gosar as the victim of "unprecedented attacks" from "the liberals, the left-wing media and the Obama political machine": "I chose not to attend the speech of Pope Francis. And then 'all hell broke loose.' Will you support me by giving $15 to my campaign today? Will you help me fend off the liberal sharks who are out for my blood?"<ref name=post/> Phoenix news station [[KSAZ-TV|Fox 10]] wrote, "The whole thing was part of Gosar's latest fundraising pitch."<ref name=fundraising/>
