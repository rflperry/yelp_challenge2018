In November 2013, in response to Americans losing their [[health insurance]] coverage because of the [[Affordable Care Act]], Upton proposed a bill what would allow them to retain their health insurance coverage.<ref>{{cite news |last1=Parker |first1=Ashley |last2=Shear |first2=Michael D. |date=November 13, 2013 |title=With Enrollment Slow, Some Democrats Back Change in Health Law |url=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/14/us/politics/democrats-threaten-to-abandon-obama-on-health-law-provision.html?hpw&rref=us&_r=0 |newspaper=New York Times |accessdate=November 14, 2013 |subscription=Yes |quote=In addition, a vote is scheduled Friday in the Republican-controlled House on a bill that would allow Americans to keep their existing health coverage through 2014 without penalties.

On September 27, 2013, Upton introduced the [[Drug Quality and Security Act (H.R. 3204; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would grant the [[Food and Drug Administration]] more power to regulate drug [[compounding]] in the wake of the [[New England Compounding Center meningitis outbreak]].<ref name=senateinches>{{cite news|last=Cox|first=Ramsey|title=Senate inches toward passing drug bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/senate/190254-senate-inches-toward-passing-drug-bill|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=14 November 2013}}</ref> Upton indicated that 3 of those who died were in his district.<ref name=uptonPR>{{cite web|title=House Passes Upton Bill to Prevent Repeat of Deadly Meningitis Outbreak, Strengthen Prescription Drug Supply Chain|url=http://upton.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=351658|publisher=Office of Representative Upton|accessdate=15 November 2013|date=September 28, 2013}}</ref> The bill passed in the House and was being debated in the Senate.

'''Environment'''

Upton's website once stated: "I strongly believe that everything must be on the table as we seek to reduce [[carbon emissions]]."<ref name=MoJo>Sheppard, Kate (2011-01-04) [http://motherjones.com/blue-marble/2011/01/fred-upton-global-warming Fred Upton's Climate Changeup], ''[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]]''</ref> In April 2009, he maintained that "[[climate change]] is a serious problem that necessitates serious solutions.

Regarding the [[regulation of greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act]] being upheld in Federal Appeals court, Upton said that Congress’s refusal to approve [[greenhouse gas]] limits constituted a decision and that lawmakers should act now to reverse the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] emissions rules. Carbon regulation “threatens to drive energy prices higher, destroy jobs and hamstring our economic recovery,” per Upton.  The [[Automotive industry in the United States|American automobile industry]] supports the regulations.<ref>[http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/27/science/earth/epa-emissions-rules-backed-by-court.html Court Backs E.P.A.

In 2007 Upton was a co-sponsor of the [[Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007]] which among other things mandated phased-in energy efficiency standards for most light bulbs. At the time, Upton noted that the legislation, ultimately signed into law by President George W. Bush, would "help preserve energy resources and reduce harmful emissions, all while saving American families billions of dollars on their electric bills."<ref name="Time050913">Grunwald, Michael [http://business.time.com/2013/05/09/long-live-the-lightbulb/ "Long Live the Lightbulb.

'''Gun laws'''

Upton does not support restrictions on the purchase and possession of guns in most circumstances, and in 2010 received "A" and "A-" ratings from the [[National Rifle Association of America|National Rifle Association]] and the [[Gun Owners of America]], respectively.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}} Upton supports some gun safety laws. From 1991-2003, Upton supported the interests of the [[Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence]] 55 percent and in 1993, Upton supported a waiting period for gun purchase to provide background checks for criminal records.<ref name="Project Vote Smart"/>

'''Fiscal issues'''

Upton supports a [[balanced budget amendment|balanced-budget amendment to the Constitution]], a proposal that failed to acquire the two-thirds support necessary to pass the House in the [[112th Congress]]. Upton also supports the [[line-item veto]], which would authorize the President to propose the rescission of full or partial funding in a bill passed by Congress.

In the 111th session of Congress, Upton tabled $7,225,000 in federal funds through eleven earmarks,<ref>OpenSecrets.org. (n.d.). Fred Upton: Earmarks (fiscal year 2010). http://www.opensecrets.org/politicians/earmarks.php?cid=N00004133&cycle=2010</ref> but political pressure from inside of the Republican party led Upton to announce his support for a Republican initiative to install a moratorium in Congress on legislative earmarks to reduce unnecessary budget expenditures and the fiscal deficit.<ref>Bonyun, S.C.
