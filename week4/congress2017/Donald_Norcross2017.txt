==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
{{main article|United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2014}}
On February 4, 2014, South Jersey Congressman [[Rob Andrews]] announced he would be resigning from Congress by the end of the month, and he did so on February 18.<ref name="robandrews">[http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2014/02/04/n-j-democrat-rob-andrews-expected-to-resign-from-congress "N.J. Democrat Rob Andrews to resign from Congress"], washingtonpost.com; accessed November 17, 2014.</ref>

Norcross announced his candidacy February 5, and within a week, he was endorsed by every New Jersey congressional Democrat, State Senate President [[Stephen Sweeney]], General Assembly Majority Leader [[Louis Greenwald]], [[Mayor of Camden, New Jersey|Mayor of Camden]] [[Dana Redd]], U.S. Senator [[Cory Booker]], and former Governor [[Jim Florio]].<ref name="phillyblogs">[http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/capitolinq/Andrews-to-leave-Congress-in-Feb.html Rob Andrews to leave Congress], philly.com; accessed November 17, 2014.</ref>

===Tenure===
Norcross easily won the Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—with 72 percent of the vote.  He ran in two elections on November 4--a special election for the balance of Andrews' 12th full term, and a regular election for a full two-year term—winning both over Republican challenger [[Garry Cobb]].  He was sworn in on November 12, 2014 by [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]].  Since he was added to the House roll on that date, he gained more seniority than other members of the House freshman class of 2014.

**[[United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces|Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces]]
