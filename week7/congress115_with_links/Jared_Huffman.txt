Huffman became a consumer attorney specializing in public interest cases. Among his court victories was a case on behalf of the [[National Organization for Women]], which required all [[California State University]] campuses to comply with [[Title IX]].<ref>{{Cite web|title = Board Members|url = http://www.cvfpb.ca.gov/members/bio-AssemblyJaredHuffman.cfm|publisher=Central Valley Flood Protection Board |accessdate = December 11, 2015|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151222082230/http://www.cvfpb.ca.gov/members/bio-AssemblyJaredHuffman.cfm|archivedate = December 22, 2015|df = mdy-all}}</ref> Huffman was a senior attorney for the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]].

==California State Assembly==

===Elections===
Huffman won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for the 6th district in a hotly contested [[primary election|primary]] in June 2006 in which he surprised the political establishment with a victory over opponents Pamela Torliatt, a [[Petaluma, California|Petaluma]] city councilwoman, and Cynthia Murray, a Marin County Supervisor who was initially considered the frontrunner. Huffman also defeated Assistant State Attorney General Damon Connelly, [[Marin County]] Democratic Chairman John Alden, and [[sociologist]] Alex Easton-Brown.

Huffman defeated Republican opponent Dr. Michael Hartnett by a more than 2:1 margin in the general election on November 7, 2006.

Huffman faced two opponents in the November 2008 general election: Republican Paul Lavery and Libertarian Timothy Hannan. He won with 70% of the vote and the 137,873 votes he received were among the most by any California Assembly candidate in 2008. In the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[primary election|primary]], Huffman was unopposed and received 57,213 votes—the most of any California Assemblymember in that election.

Due to California [[term limit]]s, Huffman would have been unable to seek a fourth Assembly term in 2012.

===Tenure===
In his first four years as a legislator, Huffman authored and passed more than 40 pieces of legislation.<ref>[https://web.archive.org/web/20080704140149/http://democrats.assembly.ca.gov/members/a06/leg.aspx assembly.ca.gov]</ref>

In 2008, Huffman sponsored a bill (AB 2950), which he wrote with internet attorney [[Daniel Balsam]] that aimed to close what its proponents characterized as loopholes in the [[CAN-SPAM Act of 2003|CAN-SPAM]] Act which made it more difficult to bring lawsuits against deceptive spammers.<ref name="SFCron2">{{cite news |author=Deborah Gage |date=April 18, 2008 |url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2008-04-18/business/17145605_1_anti-spam-law-spammers-spam-filters |title=Bill toughening anti-spam law in works |newspaper=San Francisco Chronicle |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref> Although the bill passed the State Assembly and Senate, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] [[veto]]ed the bill.<ref>{{cite news |author=Nancy Isles Nation |date=August 18, 2008 |url=http://www.marinij.com/sanrafael/ci_10239134?source=rss |title=Huffman's anti-spam bill passes |newspaper=[[Marin Independent Journal]] |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Shane Goldmacher |date=October 1, 2008 |url=http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2008/10/billwatch-actio.html |title=BillWatch: Action on the final bills |publisher=[[The Sacramento Bee]] Capitol Alert blog |accessdate=March 10, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130225001711/http://blogs.sacbee.com/capitolalertlatest/2008/10/billwatch-actio.html |archivedate=February 25, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> On February 14, 2011, Jared Huffman cosponsored a bill with [[Paul Fong]], California Assembly Bill 376, to make it illegal to possess, distribute, or sell shark fins, unless for research or commercial purposes.<ref name="billtext1">{{cite web |url=http://legiscan.com/CA/text/AB376/id/168279 |title=Bill Text: CA AB376 #124; 2011-2102 &#124; Regular Session &#124; Introduced | publisher=legiscan.com |accessdate=March 10, 2013}}</ref>

===Committee assignments===
Upon his swearing-in on December 4, 2006, Assembly Speaker [[Fabian Núñez]] immediately named Huffman the Chairman of the Committee on Environmental Safety and Toxic Materials. In August 2008, the new Assembly Speaker [[Karen Bass]] named Huffman to Chair the Water, Parks & Wildlife Committee.

Its stated goals include "pushing public policy formed on the basis of reason, science, and moral values", promoting the "separation of church and state," opposing discrimination against "atheists, agnostics, humanists, seekers, religious and nonreligious persons", among others. Huffman and Raskin will act as co-chairs.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/house/385573-dem-reps-launch-congressional-freethought-caucus|title=Dem lawmakers launch 'Freethought' congressional caucus|last1=Manchester|first1=Julia|newspaper=The Hill|accessdate=April 30, 2018}}</ref>
