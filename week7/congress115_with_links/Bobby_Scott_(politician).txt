Congressman Scott and I plan to continue to push for passage of this legislation because it is simply the right thing to do."<ref name="Introduces 99">{{cite news|title=Barbara Lee, Bobby Scott Introduce Bill For 99ers|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/12/20/barbara-lee-bobby-scott-i_n_799097.html|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=December 20, 2010}}</ref>

Had the Clinton-Kaine ticket won the [[United States presidential election, 2016|general election]], Kaine would have resigned his Senate seat, and Democratic [[Governor of Virginia]] [[Terry McAuliffe]] would have been able to appoint a replacement to serve until a 2017 [[by-election|special election]].  In August 2016, former Democratic governor [[Douglas Wilder]] stated that he would want McAuliffe to appoint Scott to the seat, stating that it "would be good for the commonwealth, good for the Democratic Party, of which Bobby has been most supportive, and great for our nation."<ref>{{cite web|last=Vozzella|first=Laura|title=Douglas Wilder wants Rep.

==Sexual harassment allegation==
On December 15, 2017, Marsheri Everson (also known as M. Reese Everson), a former [[Fellow#Nonprofit and government fellowships|congressional fellow]] who had worked in Scott's office, alleged that Scott had sexually harassed her in 2013 by making inappropriate comments and touching her on the knee and back on separate occasions.<ref name="Allegation">{{cite news|title=Former staffer accuses Virginia Rep. Bobby Scott of sexual harassment, Scott 'absolutely' denies claim|url=http://www.richmond.com/news/virginia/government-politics/former-staffer-accuses-virginia-rep-bobby-scott-of-sexual-harassment/article_3f46c045-b403-58b5-b02f-d5fcb3122874.html|newspaper=Richmond-Times Dispatch|date=December 15, 2017}}</ref>  Scott dismissed Everson's accusation as a "false allegation."<ref name="Allegation" />  Everson provided details of her claim at a news conference in [[Arlington, Virginia|Arlington]], in which she appeared with attorney [[Jack Burkman]], best known for his involvement in the conspiracy theories surrounding the [[murder of Seth Rich]].<ref name="Allegation" />

A December 22, 2017 story in the [[Richmond Free Press]] questioned Everson's allegations.<ref>{{cite news |last=Lazarus |first=Jeremy |date=December 22, 2017 |title=Questions, doubt about credibility of Rep.

In Facebook posts and in comments to the Free Press and other media outlets, scores of people have expressed certainty that Ms. Everson is more a fabricator than a truth teller."{{sfn|"Questions, doubt about credibility of Rep. Robert C. Scott’s accuser"}}  Among the details that suggested conflicting accounts by Everson was that on November 19, 2010, the Inspector General's Office for the city of Chicago placed Everson on the city's "do not hire" list indefinitely (a permanent ban) after she was fired from their office.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/32226-city-of-chicago-do-not-hire-list-bga-feb-2011.html |title=City of Chicago Do Not Hire List |last=Department of Human Resources |date=February 1, 2011 |website=documentcloud.org/ |publisher=City of Chicago |location=Chicago, IL |page=6}}</ref>  In response, in 2011, Everson sued, accusing her former supervisor of sexual harassment; she dropped the suit after going to work at the [[U.S. House of Representatives]].{{sfn|"Questions, doubt about credibility of Rep.
