Democratic Congressman [[Thomas J. Manton]] retired from the Congress in 1999, having already filed for and circulated petitions for reelection. He withdrew on the last day it was legally possible to do so and arranged for Crowley, his chosen successor, to replace him on the ballot. Crowley wasn't aware of this until Manton phoned him to tell him his name would be on the general election ballot.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/new-york/many-foes-may-struggle-to-replace-rangel/37323/| title=Many Foes May Struggle To Replace Rangel |publisher=The New York Sun |date=August 4, 2006 |accessdate=November 11, 2014}}</ref>

Crowley has fought against the practice of Female Genital Mutilation (FGM) both abroad and in the United States.

Crowley has been a consistent supporter of the 2010 [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (known as "Obamacare" or "ACA"). On March 22, 2010, he said, "I... support the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, a historic measure that will put families first when it comes to accessing health care coverage."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/495035/#.UKmV6m_7Jkk |title=Reconciliation Act Of 2010 - Public Statements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=March 22, 2010 |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> He opposed repealing the act and voted against a repeal on January 19, 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/12465/33026/4295/33026/4295/#.UKmXcW_7Jkk |title=HR 2 - Repealing the Health Care Bill - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> Also in 2011, he held an event to celebrate the one-year anniversary of the bill's passage.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/598157/#.UKmY5G_7Jkk |title=Congressman Crowley Marks One-Year Anniversary of Health Care Law with Event at Queens Senior Center - Public Statements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=March 23, 2011 |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref>

=== Immigration ===
Crowley is a heavy critic of President Trump's plan to build a wall on the U.S.–Mexico border and his decision to end DACA and Temporary Protected Status protection for qualifying immigrants in 2017. In 2017, Crowley introduced a bill that would grant green cards to undocumented workers who helped to recover and clean up New York City after the terrorist attacks on September 11.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/09/nyregion/bill-would-give-green-cards-to-undocumented-9-11-volunteers.html|title=Bill Would Give Green Cards to Undocumented 9/11 Volunteers|last=Ferré-Sadurní|first=Luis|date=July 9, 2017|work=The New York Times|access-date=April 3, 2018|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}</ref>

=== Economy and budget ===
Crowley holds the view "that reducing barriers to investment, creating opportunities for small businesses, and providing equitable working conditions for all Americans can and should be part of our national economic policy" <ref>{{cite web|url=http://crowley.house.gov/issue/economy |title=Economy and Jobs &#124; Congressman Joseph Crowley |publisher=Crowley.house.gov |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> He has supported federal spending as a way to increase economic growth. In 2008, he endorsed the Financial Asset Purchase Authority and Tax Law Amendments which established the Troubled Assets Relief Program (TARP) and allowed the Secretary of the Treasury to buy assets from troubled financial institutions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/6356/22467/4295/22467/4295/#.UKnAD2_7Jkk |title=HR 1424 - Financial Asset Purchase Authority and Tax Law Amendments - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref>

Crowley has advocated tax increases on the highest tax brackets, tax cuts for the middle class, and reduced defense spending. When serving on the Ways and Means Committee he stated, "I really don't see how it's justifiable or sensible to give a tax cut to the wealthiest among us, but at the same time increase taxes on U.S. soldiers."<ref>[http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2083&Itemid=165] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121017193931/http://blumenauer.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=2083&Itemid=165|date=October 17, 2012}}</ref> He also applauded the 2009 Budget for ending the Alternative Minimum Tax, and ensuring tax cuts for 23 million middle class Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/public-statement/358653/#.UKnCZm_7Jkk |title=Crowley Applauds House Passage 2009 Federal Budget - Public Statements - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date=March 13, 2008 |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref> In 2011, he opposed a bill that appropriated funds to the defense budget.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://votesmart.org/bill/13056/34387/4295/34387/4295/#.UKnEBm_7Jkk |title=HR 1363 - 2011 Department of Defense Budget and Additional Continuing Appropriations - Key Vote - Project Vote Smart |publisher=Votesmart.org |date= |accessdate=August 8, 2014}}</ref>

In 2017, Crowley opposed the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, saying its only goal was to give more tax cuts to America's top 1% than the working class. In December 2017, Crowley said in a floor speech, "It's a scam and the American people know it. Is this a bill that helps people who are living paycheck to paycheck? Hell no."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://insider.foxnews.com/2017/12/19/democrats-republicans-spar-over-house-tax-reform-bill-including-joe-crowley-and-tom-reed|title='Hell No!': NY Dem, NY Republican Trade Heated Remarks Over Tax Bill|date=December 19, 2017|work=Fox News Insider|access-date=April 3, 2018|language=en}}</ref>

Crowley's Irish roots have influenced his policy decisions in Congress as a member of the Friends of Ireland Caucus. He has worked on peace efforts for those involved in the conflict in Northern Ireland and securing refuge for those affected by the conflict.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crowley.house.gov/CrowleyIrelandBio|title=Crowley's Work on Ireland  {{!}} Congressman Joseph Crowley|website=crowley.house.gov|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Crowley spoke out against President Trump's effort to eliminate the position of [[United States Special Envoy for Northern Ireland]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://crowley.house.gov/press-release/chairman-crowley-statement-special-envoy-north-ireland|title=Chairman Crowley Statement on Special Envoy to the North of Ireland {{!}} Congressman Joseph Crowley|website=crowley.house.gov|language=en|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref> Eventually, Trump reversed this decision.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/politics/trump-will-not-end-northern-ireland-envoy-congressman-says-1.3235068|title=Trump will not end Northern Ireland envoy, congressman says|work=The Irish Times|access-date=April 3, 2018|language=en-US}}</ref> Crowley was named Irish-American of the year by the Irish Echo in 2018.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishecho.com/2018/01/congressman-joe-crowley-is-echo-irish-american-of-the-year-for-2018|title=Congressman Joe Crowley is Echo Irish American of the Year for 2018|date=January 10, 2018|work=Irish Echo|access-date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>

==Political campaigns==
Crowley was first elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1998. The seat was considered open after incumbent [[Thomas J. Manton]] retired, but not without controversy: Manton announced his retirement from Congress shortly after the deadline passed for filing for the Democratic primary. As head of the Queens Democratic Party apparatus, Manton was able to handpick his successor: Crowley, a former Manton staffer.

===2018 primary loss===
In the June 26, 2018 Democratic primary for his seat, Crowley was defeated by [[Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez]], who received 57% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/26/new-york-primary-election-results-2018-updates-677637|title=Top Democrat Crowley loses in shocker|author=Arkin, James; Bland, Scott|date=June 26, 2018|publisher=Politico|accessdate=June 26, 2018}}</ref> Crowley remains on the general election ballot under the [[Working Families Party]] line. Ocasio-Cortez has called on Crowley to take his name off the ballot, but he has responded that he cannot unless he moves, dies, is convicted of a felony, or files to run for another office in November as a [[paper candidate]] (which he claims would be a form of electoral fraud).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gothamist.com/2018/07/12/joe_crowley_ocasio_cortez.php|title=Joe Crowley Is Either Still Running Against Ocasio-Cortez Or A Victim Of NY's Bewildering Election Laws|publisher=|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}</ref>
