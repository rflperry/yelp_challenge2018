Before a March 2006 revision to the PATRIOT Act, interim U.S. Attorneys had a 120-day term limit, pending confirmation by the Senate of a presidential nominee. The Attorney General makes interim appointments; after the revision, the Attorney General's interim appointees had no [[term limits|term limit]], effectively bypassing the Senate confirmation process if the President declined to put forward a nomination. Griffin was among the first group of interim attorneys appointed by the Attorney General without a term limit.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nwanews.com/adg/National/175895|title=Prosecutor post is filled in recess|publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat Gazette]]|date=December 16, 2006|first=Linda|last=Satter|accessdate=2007-04-04|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927235331/http://www.nwanews.com/adg/National/175895|archivedate=2007-09-27}}</ref> Gonzales's decision to bypass confirmation for Griffin particularly angered Arkansas's then [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senators, [[Blanche Lincoln]] and [[Mark Pryor]], who both stated that Gonzales promised them Griffin would go before the Senate for confirmation. Gonzales's decision not to do so prompted Lincoln and Pryor to join many of their Democratic colleagues to demand Gonzales's resignation or firing.<ref>[http://www.fox16.com/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=d9cb4ecc-bcf2-4940-9c30-f1847cd09b7e&rss=315 Lincoln, Pryor say Gonzales should be replaced], FOX16.com; accessed November 5, 2014.</ref>

Documents released by a subsequent congressional investigation showed that, in the summer of 2006, White House officials wanted a vacant slot in the U.S. Attorney's office in Little Rock so that Griffin could fill it. Prior to this, he was a top Republican researcher and aide to Rove.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2007/POLITICS/03/13/fired.emails|title=E-mails lay out plan to dismiss U.S. attorneys|publisher=CNN|date=March 14, 2007|accessdate=2007-03-12}}</ref> On February 16, 2007, ten days after McNulty testified that Cummins was dismissed and resigned under duress to create a vacancy for Griffin's appointment, Griffin announced he would not seek the presidential nomination to be U.S. attorney in Little Rock.<ref>{{cite news|title=Interim Ark.

In September 2008, the [[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General|Office of the Inspector General]] in the Department of Justice issued a report concluding that Cummins had not been removed for any reasons related to his performance, but rather to make a place for Griffin.<ref>{{Cite web|title=An Investigation into the Removal of Nine U.S. Attorneys in 2006|publisher=[[United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General]]|date=September 2008|url=http://www.justice.gov/oig/special/s0809a/chapter5.htm| accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|last=Roth|first=Zachary|title=Report Shows White House Engineered U.S. Attorney Firings|publisher=[[Talking Points Memo]]|date=October 1, 2008|url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/2008/10/report_shows_white_house_engineered.php|accessdate=2011-01-06}}</ref>
