'''David S. Schweikert''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|w|aɪ|k|ər|t}} (born March 3, 1962) is a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Arizona]], serving since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].  Schweikert currently represents {{ushr|Arizona|6}}, which includes most of northern [[Phoenix, Arizona|Phoenix]] as well as [[Scottsdale, Arizona|Scottsdale]], [[Paradise Valley, Arizona|Paradise Valley]], and [[Cave Creek, Arizona|Cave Creek]].  He previously represented the [[Arizona's 5th congressional district|5th District]] from 2011 to 2013.

Schweikert previously served two terms in the [[Arizona State House of Representatives]] (1991–1994), was chairman of the state Board of Equalization (1995–2004), and was the elected [[Maricopa County]] Treasurer (2004–2007). Schweikert ran for the U.S. House of Representatives twice (losing a primary to [[J. D. Hayworth]] in 1994 and losing a general election to incumbent [[Harry Mitchell]] in 2008) before winning election to the House for the first time in 2010.

==Early life, education, and business career==
Schweikert was born in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], to an unwed mother who, according to Schweikert, almost had an abortion but chose instead to put him up for adoption.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.lifenews.com/2013/01/18/congressman-i-was-almost-an-abortion-victim-adoption-saved-me/ |title=Congressman: I Was Almost an Abortion Victim, Adoption Saved Me |publisher=LifeNews.com |date=2013-01-18 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>Abortion, except to save the life of the mother, was a crime in California in 1962, see Penal Code s. 274 (prior to 1967 amendment).  The article fails to explain how the existence of the criminal statute prevented anyone determined to obtain an abortion, and able to travel to Mexico, from obtaining one.</ref> He grew up in Scottsdale with his adoptive parents and two adoptive siblings. He graduated from [[Saguaro High School]] there (1980), then earned a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (finance and real estate, 1985) and [[MBA]] (2005) from the [[Arizona State University]]'s [[W. P. Carey School of Business]].

Schweikert and his wife Joyce live in [[Fountain Hills, Arizona|Fountain Hills]].

==Arizona House of Representatives (1991–1995)==
Schweikert was elected to the [[Arizona State House of Representatives]] for District 28 in 1990, and re-elected in 1992.<ref>

Quayle, whose home in Phoenix had been drawn into the 9th but was just outside the boundaries of the 6th, opted to seek re-election in the 6th as well. During the bitter primary campaign, Schweikert was widely criticised for a mailer that accused Quayle of "going both ways", suggesting that he was [[bisexual]]. On the reverse, the mailer listed issues on which it claimed Quayle had taken both liberal and conservative positions. Senator [[Jon Kyl]] said that "such campaign tactics insult the voters, degrade politics and expose those who stoop to them as unworthy of high office" and Senator [[John McCain]] said the mailer was one of the "worst that I have seen" and that it "crosses the boundary of decent political dialogue and discourse." Quayle's spokeswoman called the mailer "utterly false" and "a sleazy smear tactic." Schweikert's spokesman responded that people "should get their minds out of the gutter" because the mailer was "obviously" referring to "'both ways'—as in liberal and conservative." ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' asked two political scientists to review the mailer, who both said that they had "never seen anybody accuse someone of flip-flopping [on political issues] that way" and said that it was "difficult to believe" that the sexual suggestion was unintentional.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/phoenix/news/2012/08/06/kyl-faults-schweikert-after-mailer.html |title=Kyl faults Schweikert after mailer says Quayle 'goes both ways' – Phoenix Business Journal |publisher=Bizjournals.com |date=2012-08-06 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last=Nowicki |first=Dan |url=http://www.azcentral.com/news/articles/2012/08/03/20120803district-6-schweikert-like-fight-in-dc.html |title=District 6 race: David Schweikert says 'I like the fight' in D.C |publisher=Azcentral.com |date=2012-08-03 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|author= |url=http://archive.azcentral.com/members/Blog/azdc/169420 |title=azcentral.com staff blogs – AZ/DC Blog – azdc – McCain endorses Quayle, scolds Schweikert for mailer |publisher=Archive.azcentral.com |date=2012-08-15 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/house-races/243973-mccain-blasts-arizona-republican-who-accused-quayle-of-going-both-ways |title=McCain blasts Arizona Republican who accused Quayle of ‘going both ways’ |publisher=TheHill.com |date=2012-08-16 |accessdate=2015-04-01}}</ref>

''[[Politico]]'' quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman [[Lynn Westmoreland]] of Georgia as explaining that Schweikert, Amash and Huelskamp were removed for "their inability to work with other members."
