'''Richard L. Hanna''' (born January 25, 1951) is an American politician who served as a [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from [[New York (state)|New York]] from 2011 to 2017. His district was numbered the [[New York's 24th congressional district|24th]] during his first two years in Congress; since 2013, it has been the {{ushr|NY|22|22nd district}}.

== Early life, education, and business career ==
Hanna was born in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and raised in [[Marcy, New York|Marcy]]. His grandparents owned a [[dairy farm]] in [[Herkimer County, New York|Herkimer County]]. He graduated from Whitesboro High School in Marcy. Then, he graduated from [[Reed College]] with a bachelor's degree in [[Economics]] and [[Political Science]]. After college, Hanna returned to New York to start his own construction business called Hanna Construction.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://online.wsj.com/article/AP130006b0837c4a4a8165804738532220.html|title= Clinton stumps for NY House Dems in tight races|publisher=''[[Associated Press]]''|date= November 1, 2010|access-date=17 May 2017}}</ref> Hanna is of [[Lebanese American|Lebanese descent]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2013/11/15/extensions-of-remarks-section/article/E1678-4|title= Honoring Lebanon on its 70th Independence Day Hon.

In 2008, Hanna ran against incumbent Democrat [[Mike Arcuri]] and narrowly lost. In 2010, he ran in a rematch and won.

Due to redistricting, Hanna ran in the new [[New York's 22nd congressional district|22nd district]] in 2012.

In his 2012 campaign for re-election against Democrat [[Dan Lamb]], television stations [[WUTR]] in [[Utica, New York|Utica]] and [[WSYR-TV|WSYR]] in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse]] announced they would jointly air a debate between Hanna and Lamb. Hanna declined to participate, citing another scheduled televised debate and five that would not be televised. The stations said that if Hanna did not appear, they would air a 30-minute question-and-answer session with Lamb. According to Steve Merren, the vice president and general manager of WUTR's parent company, [[Nexstar Media Group|Nexstar Broadcasting Group]], Hanna then contacted Merren. In an email to staff, Merren stated, "He indicated to me that we would not be considered for his ad dollars and our level of cooperation in the future could be affected." Merren then directed that WUTR not go ahead with the broadcast. Both Merren and a Hanna spokeswoman denied that threats had been made. After the inadvertent disclosure of the internal email, Merren told the press that Hanna "did not say he would pull his ad dollars." The Hanna campaign said that his conversation with Merren had been "nothing more than a courtesy call". The Lamb campaign said that Hanna was "using his money to influence the journalistic decisions of a local news agency."<ref>{{cite web | title = GOP Congressman Threatens Local News Station for Covering Debate| publisher = [[Common Dreams]]| date = October 6, 2012 | url = http://readersupportednews.org/news-section2/318-66/13825-gop-congressman-threatens-local-news-station-for-covering-debate| accessdate = October 7, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web| title = Email: Hanna discussed pulling ads after debate flap with WUTR| publisher = [[Observer-Dispatch]]| date = October 6, 2012| url = http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1931761214/Email-Hanna-discussed-pulling-ads-after-debate-flap-with-WUTR| accessdate = October 7, 2012| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20130205081532/http://www.uticaod.com/news/x1931761214/Email-Hanna-discussed-pulling-ads-after-debate-flap-with-WUTR| archivedate = February 5, 2013| df = mdy-all}}</ref>

In 2014, Hanna received a primary challenge from Republican Assemblywoman [[Claudia Tenney]]. Described as a "Tea Party favorite," Tenney reportedly challenged Hanna because "she believed he had abandoned his conservative principles during two terms in Congress. Tenney called Hanna a RINO (Republican in Name Only) who had become the third-most liberal Republican in the House of Representatives, based on his voting record." Hanna defeated Tenney by a margin of 53% to 47%; when asked about the message sent by his win, he said, "I hope it's a message that you could be thoughtful and inclusive and still be elected."<ref>{{cite web | title = NY-22 election results: U.S. Rep.

In February 2011, Hanna published an Op-ed opposing the extension of the [[USA Patriot Act|USA PATRIOT Act]]. Editors from the ''[[Syracuse Post-Standard]]'', which published the piece, later [http://blog.syracuse.com/opinion/2011/03/hannas_near-plagiarism.html reprimanded] Hanna for plagiarizing content from a report by Julian Sanchez of the [[Cato Institute]] in his editorial. Sanchez indicated that Hanna had his permission to use the content, although he was not referenced in the piece.

The first bill Hanna co-sponsored was H.R. 4 which repealed the 1099 tax reporting provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]. President Obama signed the bill into law in April 2011.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://frwebgate.access.gpo.gov/cgi-bin/getdoc.cgi?dbname=112_cong_public_laws&docid=f:publ009.112|title=www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/PLAW-112publ9/html/PLAW-112publ9.htm|publisher=|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref> In early 2011 Congressman Hanna voted to repeal health care reform.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.thepoliticalguide.com/rep_bios.php?rep_id=74478446&category=views&id=20101002092318|title=This website is currently unavailable.|website=www.thepoliticalguide.com|accessdate=November 23, 2017}}</ref> Hanna voted to support the Energy Tax Prevention Act which would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating greenhouse gasses and implementing a "cap-and-trade" system through regulation.<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2011/roll249.xml</ref> Hanna voted against cuts to [[NPR]] and [[Planned Parenthood]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/news/index.ssf/2011/02/deep_federal_spending_cuts_bue.html|title=Deep federal spending cuts?

At a rally in support of the [[Equal Rights Amendment]] in March 2012, Hanna urged women to donate to Democratic candidates, saying: "I think these are very precarious times for women, it seems. So many of your rights are under assault... Contribute your money to people who speak out on your behalf, because the other side -- my side -- has a lot of it."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/03/22/richard-hanna-gop-congress_n_1373381.html|work=The Huffington Post|title=Richard Hanna, GOP Congressman, Tells Women To Give Their Money To Democrats|date=March 22, 2012}}</ref>

In 2013, he supported [[same-sex marriage]], becoming the second Republican member of Congress to do so (the first being [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]]).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/weigel/2013/02/26/gay_marriage_legal_brief_two_republicans_in_congress_support_lgbt_rights.html|title=Gay marriage legal brief: Two Republicans in Congress support LGBT rights|publisher=Slate.com|date=26 February 2013|accessdate=17 May 2017}}</ref> 

In June 2013, Hanna was the only Republican congressman to vote against proposed legislation to ban [[abortions]] after 20 weeks of pregnancy except for victims of [[rape]] or [[incest]] who have reported the crime to authorities. He opposes partial birth abortions, but stated that he was unable to support this legislation because it would cast aside exception for the health of the mother, and it fails to adequately account for unique circumstances that can arise after 20 weeks because every pregnancy is specific.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2013/06/18/hanna-sole-new-york-republican-to-oppose-house-abortion-bill/|title=Hanna sole New York Republican to oppose House abortion bill|last1=Tumulty|first1=Brian|date=June 18, 2013|publisher=Politics on the Hudson|accessdate=July 20, 2013}}</ref>

In December 2015, Hanna—citing family responsibilities—announced that he did not plan to run for re-election in 2016. Hanna indicated that then-Assemblymember Claudia Tenney's decision to challenge him for a second time in a Republican primary did not influence his decision not to seek re-election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.syracuse.com/politics/index.ssf/2015/12/gop_rep_richard_hanna_plans_to_retire_at_end_of_term.html|title=GOP Rep.

On August 2, 2016, Hanna became the first sitting Republican member of Congress to say that he would vote for [[Hillary Clinton]] for president over [[Donald Trump]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]], referring to the Republican nominee as "a national embarrassment".<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep.
