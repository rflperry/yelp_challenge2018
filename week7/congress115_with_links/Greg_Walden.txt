'''Gregory Paul Walden''' (born January 10, 1957) is an American politician, the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|OR|2}}, first elected to that office in 1998. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], and {{Asof|2017|lc=y}} the only Republican member of the congressional delegation from Oregon. The 2nd district covers more than two-thirds of the state (generally, east of the [[Cascade Range|Cascades]]). He is the son of Paul E. Walden, three-term Oregon state representative.<ref name="arcweb_leg1971">{{cite web | title = Oregon Legislative Assembly (56th) 1971 Regular Session | work = Oregon State Archives (official website)| publisher = [[Oregon Secretary of State]] | year = 2006 | url = http://arcweb.sos.state.or.us/pages/records/legislative/recordsguides/histleg/statehood/1971reg.html | accessdate = December 8, 2006}}</ref>

==Early life, education and career==
Walden was born in [[The Dalles, Oregon]], the son of Elizabeth (née McEwen) and Paul Ernest Walden.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/walden.htm|title=RootsWeb.com Home Page|website=freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com|accessdate=January 31, 2018}}</ref> He earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[University of Oregon]] in 1981.<ref name=CQRollGuide>{{cite news|title=Guide to the New Congress |date=November 4, 2010 |url=http://innovation.cq.com/newmember/2010elexnguide.pdf |work=[[Roll Call|CQ Roll Call]] |accessdate=November 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708200600/http://innovation.cq.com/newmember/2010elexnguide.pdf |archivedate=July 8, 2011 |df= }}</ref>  Before being elected to Congress, Walden owned and ran radio stations.

== Political career ==
Walden served as Press Secretary and Chief of Staff to Congressman [[Denny Smith]] from 1981 to 1987. He was elected to the [[Oregon House of Representatives]] in 1988 and served in the House until 1995, when he was appointed to the [[Oregon State Senate]] to fill a vacancy that opened up when [[Wes Cooley]] was elected to the U. S. House. Walden rose to the position of assistant majority leader in the Senate and was considering a bid for Oregon Governor in 1994. However, upon discovering that the son he and his wife were expecting had a heart defect, Walden decided to not run for Governor and to not seek re-election to the state Senate.  Their son died soon after birth.<ref>{{cite news

Walden was tapped as campaign manager for Cooley's re-election bid. However, after Cooley was caught in several lies about his military service, Walden was one of many Republicans who called for Cooley to drop out of the race. Walden went as far as to announce he was running for the 2nd District seat as an independent.  However, he served as Oregon state chairman of [[Bob Dole]]'s presidential campaign, and he touted his "strong Republican credentials"—implying that he would serve as a Republican if elected. Walden's candidacy led to fears that the Democrats could take advantage of a split in the Republican vote and take a seat they hadn't held since 1981.<ref name=toner>{{cite news

Smith didn't run for reelection in 1998. Walden easily won the Republican primary and breezed to election in November.  He has been reelected nine times.  Though his district contains some liberal-leaning communities such as [[Ashland, Oregon|Ashland]] and his hometown of Hood River, most of the district leans heavily Republican, and Walden has always been reelected easily. In 2002, he defeated [[Democratic Party of Oregon|Democrat]] [[Peter J. Buckley|Peter Buckley]], who later became a member of the [[Oregon House of Representatives]]. In [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2006|2006]], Walden defeated Democratic candidate [[Carol Voisin]], and in [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008|2008]] he won a sixth term with 70% of the vote over Democrat Noah Lemas and [[Pacific Green Party|Pacific Green]] Tristin Mock. Following the defeat of Senator [[Gordon Smith (politician)|Gordon Smith]] in the 2008 elections, Walden became the only Republican to represent Oregon in the United States Congress.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Party leadership===
Walden was chosen by Speaker [[John Boehner]] to be chairman of the House Majority Transition Committee. He served as chairman of the House Republican Leadership through most of 2010.<ref>[http://www.whorunsgov.com/politerati/revolving-door/meet-the-gop-transition-leader-greg-walden/ Meet the GOP transition leader: Greg Walden] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110302165428/http://www.whorunsgov.com/politerati/revolving-door/meet-the-gop-transition-leader-greg-walden/ |date=March 2, 2011 }}, WhoRunsGov.com, November 8, 2010</ref>

Following the 2012 Elections, Walden became chair of the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. In July 2014, he announced he would seek a second term as chairman of the committee, arguing he would help provide continuity in a changing leadership team after the defeat of [[House Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Livingston|first1=Abby|title=Greg Walden to Seek Second Term Running NRCC (Updated)|url=http://atr.rollcall.com/elections-2014-nrcc-greg-walden-second-term/?dcz=emailalert|website=www.rollcall.com|publisher=Roll Call|accessdate=July 30, 2014}}</ref> He served a second term, the traditional limit for holders of that office, ending in 2016.

===Committee assignments===

** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology|Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]] (Chairman)
** [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Energy and Power|Subcommittee on Energy and Power]]

From 2010 to 2011, Walden gave up his seat on the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce|Committee on Energy and Commerce]], at Republican leadership request so that [[Parker Griffith]], who had recently switched parties, could take his spot on that committee.<ref name="nrccroll">{{cite web | title = Walden Rises Up From Obscurity | work = [[Roll Call]] | publisher = [[National Republican Congressional Committee]] | date = March 8, 2010 | url = http://www.nrcc.org/news/Read.aspx?ID=1565 | accessdate = April 9, 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100320140531/http://www.nrcc.org/news/Read.aspx?ID=1565 | archivedate = March 20, 2010 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

Walden founded the [[Small Brewers Caucus]] (see [[Alcohol in Oregon]]) and the [[Digital Television Caucus]]; as of 2007, he was a member of 39 [[congressional caucus]]es.<ref>{{cite news|title=Another day, another caucus

===Legislation sponsored===
The following is an incomplete list of legislation that Walden introduced into the House of Representatives.
* [[Central Oregon Jobs and Water Security Act (H.R. 2640; 113th Congress)]] – a land-use and water bill related to the [[Crooked River (Oregon)|Crooked River]] in [[Oregon]] and the [[Arthur R. Bowman Dam|Bowman Dam]].<ref name=hr2640sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 2640 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/2640|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}</ref>   H.R. 2640 would modify features of the Crooked River Project located in central Oregon, near the city of Prineville, and prioritize how water from the project would be allocated for different uses.<ref name=cbo2640>{{cite web|title=CBO – H.R. 2640|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44486|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=October 30, 2013}}</ref>
* [[Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.<ref name=3675cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3675 – CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45057|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> The FCC would have to act in a more transparent way as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.<ref name=PeteVotesTransparency>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes for more transparency at the FCC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/200503-house-votes-for-more-transparency-at-the-fcc|accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 11, 2014}}</ref> Walden indicated that the bill was written in response, among other things, to a proposed FCC study on the decisions made by newspaper editorial boards.<ref name="PeteVotesTransparency"/> Walden argued that "Americans deserve greater... transparency and accountability from their government," particularly because "an item as controversial as this study made it all the way through the FCC without so much as a commission vote."<ref name="PeteVotesTransparency"/> The study was deemed "dangerous" by him, because it threatened the [[First Amendment|free speech and freedom of the press]] rights of the newspapers.<ref name="PeteVotesTransparency"/>
* [[Hermiston Reversionary Interest Release Act (H.R. 3366; 113th Congress)]] – a bill that would release the interest of the United States in some land currently being used for [[Oregon State University]]'s [[Hermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center]] in [[Hermiston, Oregon]].<ref name=BLMtestimony>{{cite web|last=Nedd|first=Michael D|title=H.R. 3366: Hermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center|url=http://www.doi.gov/ocl/hearings/113/hr3366_022614.cfm|publisher=United States Department of the Interior|accessdate=May 29, 2014|date=February 26, 2014}}</ref> This would enable the Hermiston Agricultural Research and Extension Center to relocate without the land it is currently on being returned to the federal government.<ref name=ClevengerBulletin>{{cite news|last=Clevenger|first=Andrew|title=House passes Hermiston legislation|url=http://www.bendbulletin.com/localstate/2114459-151/house-passes-hermiston-legislation?entryType=0#|accessdate=May 29, 2014|newspaper=The Bulletin|date=May 29, 2014}}</ref> The Bureau of Land Management opposed the bill and it died in the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. The bill was signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] in December 2014.
* [[STELA Reauthorization Act of 2014 (H.R. 4572; 113th Congress)]] – a bill related to the regulation of satellite broadcasting in the United States.<ref name=4572sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4572 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4572|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 22, 2014}}</ref>

=== Intervention in Malheur Wildlife Refuge issues ===
Walden, whose district office incorporates the [[Malheur National Wildlife Refuge]], said, although one militant was killed and another wounded in the armed occupation of the refuge, "We can all be grateful that today has ended peacefully, and that this situation is finally over. Now, life in Harney County can begin to return to normal and the community can begin the long process of healing." Walden  complained about allegedly poor federal forest and land management policies during the occupation, and said he would like to see changes to those policies: "We need to foster a more cooperative spirit between the federal agencies and the people who call areas like Harney County home."<ref name=PoliticianReactions-01>{{cite news |last=Mapes |first=Jeff |date=February 16, 2016 |orig-year=1st pub.
