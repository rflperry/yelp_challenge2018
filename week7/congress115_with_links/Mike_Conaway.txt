In 2006, Conaway voted against extending the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/49935/mike-conaway/13/civil-liberties-and-civil-rights|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/news/politics/state-politics/20131224-aides-to-texans-on-capitol-hill-alter-bosses-wikipedia-entries.ece|title=Aides to Texans on Capitol Hill alter bosses’ Wikipedia entries - Local Politics - Dallas News|date=24 December 2013|publisher=}}</ref>

In January 2007, Conaway began chairing the three-member audit committee for the [[National Republican Congressional Committee]]. By January 28, 2008, Conaway had uncovered a fraud, where hundreds of thousands of dollars were missing from NRCC bank accounts, and supposed annual audits on the NRCC books had actually not been performed since 2001.<ref>[https://archive.is/20080315035609/http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/ap/tx/5618101.html  Suzanne Gamboa, "Texas lawmaker uncovers GOP committee fraud", Associated Press, published by the ''[[Houston Chronicle]]'' (March 13, 2008).]</ref>

Conaway introduced legislation to extend and reform the federal tax credit to support wide scale commercial deployment of [[carbon capture and storage]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/287218-trump-gop-climate-change-denial-hastens-coals-decline |title=Trump, GOP climate change denial hastens coal's decline |author=Paul Bledsoe |date=12 July 2016 |website=[[TheHill.com]] |access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

In February 2018, Conaway prevented efforts by the Democrats on the House Intelligence Committee to investigate financial links between Trump, his businesses, his family and Russian actors.<ref name=":0">{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/02/26/politics/russia-republicans-trump-finances/index.html|title=In probes, GOP draws line at Trump's finances|last=CNN|first=Manu Raju and Jeremy Herb,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-02-26}}</ref> Conaway prevented subpoenas for related bank records, Trump's tax returns and witnesses.<ref name=":0" /> Democrats on the Committee had, for example, asked for subpoenas to [[Deutsche Bank]], which the Trump Organization and Jared Kushner (Trump's son-in-law and senior White House advisor) have borrowed extensively from.<ref name=":0" />

In March 2018, Conaway laid out the findings of a report by the Republican members of the House Intelligence Committee.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/sunday-talk-shows/379005-house-intel-republican-panel-did-not-investigate-collusion|title=Conaway walks back comment after saying House Intel didn't probe collusion|last=Shelbourne|first=Mallory|date=2018-03-18|work=TheHill|access-date=2018-03-18|language=en}}</ref> One of the findings was that the committee had found no evidence of collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign in the 2016 election; Democrats on the committee said that they had come to no such conclusion.<ref name=":1" /> A few days later, Conaway walked back that finding, saying "Our committee was not charged with answering the collusion idea".<ref name=":1" /> Asked why the committee drew a conclusion if it had not investigated the matter, Conaway denied that the committee had drawn a conclusion, "What we said is we found no evidence of it. That’s a different statement. We found no evidence of collusion."<ref name=":1" />

===Political campaigns===
Conaway first ran for elective office in 2003, when he ran in a special election for the 19th Congressional District, which came open after 18-year Republican incumbent [[Larry Combest]] stepped down shortly after winning a 10th term. Conaway lost by 587 votes to fellow Republican [[Randy Neugebauer]]. A few months later, the [[Texas Legislature]] [[2003 Texas redistricting|redrew the state's districts]] in an effort engineered by then-[[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]]. Three brand-new districts were created, one of them being the 11th, which was based in Midland. Previously, Midland had been part of the [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]-based 19th District. DeLay was particularly keen to draw a district based in Midland, Odessa and the oil-rich [[Permian Basin (North America)|Permian Basin]] in part because [[Texas House]] Speaker [[Tom Craddick]] was from that area. This district is heavily Republican&nbsp;– by some accounts, the most Republican district in Texas.  Republican candidates usually garner 70 percent or more of the vote in this area ([[Glasscock County]] had voted 93 percent for Bush in 2000, the highest percentage of any county in the nation). The race was essentially over when Conaway announced his candidacy. He won in November with 77 percent of the vote, one of the largest percentages by anyone facing major-party opposition.

Conaway has been reelected six times with no substantive opposition. He has faced a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] challenger three times, in 2010, 2012 and 2018. He was reelected unopposed in 2006 and faced no major-party opposition in 2008 and 2014.

Conaway won re-nomination to a sixth term in the U.S. House in the Republican primary held on March 4, 2014. He polled 53,107 votes (74 percent); his challenger, Wade Brown, received 18,979 votes (26 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176 |title=Republican primary election returns, March 4, 2014 |publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=March 6, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140305180619/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/mar04_169_state.htm?x=0&y=218&id=176 |archivedate=March 5, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

Conaway won re-election in the general election held on November 4, 2014. He polled 107,752 votes (90 percent); his challenger, Libertarian Ryan T. Lange, received 11,607 (10 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov04_175_state.htm?x=0&y=2262&id=650|title=2014 General Election Returns|publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us|accessdate=November 6, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141107032148/https://team1.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/nov04_175_state.htm?x=0&y=2262&id=650|archivedate=November 7, 2014|df=}}</ref>
