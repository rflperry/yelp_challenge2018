==State legislature==
Elected to the Texas House from District 74 in 1990, Gallego was the first [[Hispanic]] to represent this vast border district.

In the Texas House, Gallego served on the board of directors of the [[National Association of Latino Elected Officials]] (NALEO), and four terms as Chairman of the [[Mexican American Legislative Caucus]] (MALC), a caucus of Texas representatives who are of Mexican-American descent or who serve a significant Mexican-American constituency. In 2008, [[Trey Martinez Fischer]] replaced Gallego as Chairman of MALC.<ref name=journal/><ref>{{cite news|last=Glazer|first=Matt|title=Mexican American Legislative Caucus (MALC) Elects New Leadership|url=http://www.burntorangereport.com/diary/7597/|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=Burnt Orange Report|date=December 9, 2008}}</ref>

''Alpine Daily Planet'', September 1, 2011.</ref> His state house district was virtually coextensive with the central portion of the congressional district; indeed, he had represented almost all of the central portion of the congressional district at one time or another during his two decades in the state legislature.

He finished second in the Democratic primary, behind former congressman [[Ciro Rodriguez]], who had received [[Bill Clinton]]'s endorsement. He then defeated Rodriguez in the July 31 runoff election by a margin of 55-45 percent.<ref>[http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe 2012 Democratic Party Primary Runoff July 31, 2012] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061108172637/http://elections.sos.state.tx.us/elchist.exe |date=November 8, 2006 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Martin|first1=Gary|title=Gallego beats Rodriguez to challenge Canseco in the fall|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Gallego-beats-Rodriguez-to-challenge-Canseco-in-3752147.php|accessdate=19 August 2014|publisher=MySanAntonio|date=August 1, 2012}}</ref> During the course of his campaign, Gallego overhauled his campaign staff four times.<ref name=campaign>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Gary|title=Pete Gallego overhauls congressional campaign a fourth time|url=http://blog.mysanantonio.com/texas-on-the-potomac/2012/08/pete-gallego-overhauls-congressional-campaign-a-fourth-time/|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=San Antonio Express-News|date=August 16, 2012}}</ref>

In the general election, Gallego defeated Canseco with 50 percent of the vote to Canseco's 46 percent, a margin of 9,200 votes.  While Gallego lost in [[Bexar County]], home to more than half the district's population, he dominated his former state house district. The campaign between Gallego and Canseco was contentious, with Gallego alleging that Canseco was a "right-wing extremist," and Canseco calling Gallego a "radical environmentalist."<ref name=campaign/><ref>{{cite news|last=Martin|first=Gary|title=Gallego starts swinging at Canseco in 23rd congressional race|url=http://www.mysanantonio.com/news/local_news/article/Gallego-starts-swinging-at-Canseco-in-23rd-3755212.php|accessdate=22 May 2014|newspaper=San Antonio News-Express|date=August 1, 2012}}</ref>

;2018
Gallego, meanwhile, is testing the waters as a potential 2018 candidate once more against Hurd.  Reapportionment of the district could play a major role as to whether Gallego decides to enter the race. At least two other Democrats may also run for their party nomination, Judith Canales, a former officer of the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] from [[Eagle Pass, Texas|Eagle Pass]], and Jay Hulings, a graduate of [[Harvard Law School]] and an assistant U.S. attorney in San Antonio.<ref>Gilbert Garcia, "Gallego inches toward third run at Congressman Hurd," ''San Antonio Express-News,'' July 9, 2017, p.
