==Political campaigns==

===2006===
{{Main|Colorado 7th congressional district election, 2006}}
Perlmutter won the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for the 7th District by defeating former State Representative [[Peggy Lamm]] and college professor [[Herb Rubenstein]], with 53% of the vote in the primary. State education chairman [[Rick O'Donnell]] was unopposed for the Republican nomination. [[Dave Chandler]], a Green, was also a candidate.

The seat was held by Republican [[Bob Beauprez]], who was reelected to a second term in [[U.S. House elections, 2004|2004]] with 55% of the vote, after winning his first term by only 121 votes. He left the seat at the end of the 2004–2006 term, having failed in his bid to become [[Governor of Colorado]].

In late September, O'Donnell was put on the defensive when ads appeared noting that he had previously supported abolishing Social Security. A Survey USA poll soon after that showed Perlmutter with a 54 to 37 percent lead, although GOP consultants guessed that the support was "soft".<ref>[http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_5024085,00.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070309071424/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/drmn/elections/article/0,2808,DRMN_24736_5024085,00.html |date=March 9, 2007 }}</ref> An October 4 poll released by Zogby showed Perlmutter ahead of O'Donnell by 45-34 percent.<ref>{{cite news|title=Results in key House races: Reuters poll|agency=Reuters|date=2006-10-04|work=Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100400310.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024182422/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/10/04/AR2006100400310.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-10-24}}</ref> ''Cook Political Report'' rating: ''Republican Toss Up''. ''CQPolitics'' rating: ''No Clear Favorite''.

In the end, Perlmutter (54%) soundly defeated O'Donnell (42%) for the congressional seat, helping Democrats to regain the majority in the U.S. House.
