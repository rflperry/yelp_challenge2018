McClintock ran for State Controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee [[Steve Westly]], an [[eBay]] executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1.

The ads featured the character ''Angus McClintock'', a fictional cousin and fellow [[Scottish American]] extolling Tom McClintock's virtues of thriftiness and accountability with low-budget fifteen-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes behind Westley, who won with a plurality of 45.3% of the vote. McClintock obtained 45.1% of the vote, while three other candidates obtained a combined 9.5% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=1608|title=Our Campaigns – CA Controller Race – Nov 05, 2002|work=ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

;2008
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2008#District 4}}
On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in [[California's 4th congressional district]], which is hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican [[John Doolittle]], decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the [[California Constitution]] required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term. Furthermore, in order to vote using a ballot in regards to a specific congressional district, one must live within that district. Because Thousand Oaks is outside of California's Fourth Congressional District, McClintock was thus ineligible to vote for himself.<ref name="SacBee030408"/>

Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans [[Rico Oller]] and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock.<ref name="SacBee030408">{{cite news|author=Hecht, Peter |title=McClintock in, Oller out in race to replace Doolittle |work=[[Sacramento Bee]] |date=2008-03-04 |url=http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/759440.html |accessdate=2008-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206125635/http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/759440.html |archivedate=December 6, 2008 }}</ref><ref>{{cite news|author=Gunzberger, Ronecemb|title=California|work=Politics1.com|date=2008-03-05|url=http://www.politics1.com/blog-0308.htm#0305|accessdate=2008-03-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080310221242/http://politics1.com/blog-0308.htm#0305|archivedate=2008-03-10|df=}}</ref> McClintock was endorsed by the [[Republican Liberty Caucus]],<ref>[http://www.rlc.org/2008/11/05/rlc-election-results/ "RLC Election Results."

McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman [[Doug Ose]], a moderate represented the neighboring [[California's 3rd congressional district|3rd District]] from 1999 to 2005. Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a [[carpetbagger]] and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54–39%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=341896|title=Our Campaigns – CA District 04 – R Primary Race – Jun 03, 2008|work=ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

The Democratic nominee was retired [[Usaf|Air Force]] [[Lieutenant Colonel (United States)|Lt. Col.]] [[Charles Brown (California)|Charlie Brown]], who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the [[California State Senate]], despite the fact that he lived in [[Elk Grove, California|Elk Grove]], near Sacramento, for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his State Senate district. He stated, "Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-me-mcclintock23mar23,0,6751476.story|work=Los Angeles Times|first=Patrick|last=McGreevy|title=McClintock criticized for taking per diem housing allowance|date=March 23, 2008}}</ref> However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but uses his mother's address. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/963198.html|title=Ballot Watch: "Ose's attack on McClintock for taking per diem riles rival's wife"|work=[[Sacramento Bee]]|date=May 24, 2008|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206125641/http://www.sacbee.com/111/story/963198.html|archivedate=December 6, 2008|deadurl=yes|df=}}</ref> McClintock ran ads attacking Brown’s participation at a 2005 protest by [[Code Pink]], an infamous [[anti-war]] group, and argued Brown supported [[Gay marriage in California|gay marriage]] but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]].<ref name="nationaljournal.com"/>

By November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from [[El Dorado County]] shortly after [[Thanksgiving]]. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes.<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=Barone |first2=Chuck |last1=McCutcheon|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref> He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in [[Placer County]], the largest county in the district.
