==U.S. House of Representatives==
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 19}}
Republican 14th District Congressman [[Connie Mack IV]] decided not to run for reelection to his seat, in order to challenge [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Bill Nelson (politician)|Bill Nelson]]. Radel decided to run in the open seat, which had been renumbered as the 19th District.   Five other Republican candidates also filed to run. 

Controversy occurred when it was discovered that the campaign committee "Friends of Trey Radel, Inc." had purchased his opponents' domain names nearly a year before he announced he was going to run for office.<ref name="Domain Gate">{{cite web|last=Ward|first=Kenric|title=Trey Radel Shuts "Domain Gate" – Will Give Up Websites|url=http://www.sunshinestatenews.com/story/trey-radel-shuts-domain-gate-will-give-websites |publisher=Sunshine State News|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}</ref> When this was revealed, he denied knowing about it, blaming it on staff, but eventually admitted he had purchased the domain names.<ref name="Domain Gate"/> Subsequently, his campaign committee created websites and attached them to his opponents' domain names, purportedly for the purpose of disseminating the voting records of the opponents, which were posted on the websites.<ref name="Domain Gate" />  

Radel's political philosophy is conservative, but he nevertheless has said he supports the principles of the [[DREAM Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.floridapoliticalpress.com/2012/07/29/trey-radel-just-cant-seem-to-avoid-controversy/ |title=» Trey Radel Just Can’t Seem To Avoid Controversy |publisher= FloridaPoliticalPress.com |date=July 29, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Radel was endorsed by the incumbent Connie Mack IV, former U.S. Senator [[Connie Mack III]], and former [[New York City Mayor]] [[Rudy Giuliani]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.treyradel.com/endorsements/ |title=Endorsements « Trey Radel |publisher=Treyradel.com |date= |accessdate=November 7, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121104095101/http://www.treyradel.com/endorsements/ |archivedate=November 4, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> Chauncey Goss (who finished second to Radel in the primary)<ref>{{cite web |title=Florida Division of Elections |url=http://doedoe.dos.state.fl.us/elections/resultsarchive/Index.asp?ElectionDate=8/14/2012&DATAMODE= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105003604/http://doedoe.dos.state.fl.us/Elections/ResultsArchive/Index.asp?ElectionDate=8%2F14%2F2012&DATAMODE= |archivedate=November 5, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>  was endorsed by U.S. Congressman [[Paul Ryan]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Buzzacco |first=Jenna |url=http://www.naplesnews.com/news/2012/aug/14/trey-radel-southwest-florida-congressional-seat-19/ |title=Radel declares victory in Southwest Florida race for Congress |publisher= Naples Daily News |date= August 14, 2012 |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref> Radel won the primary with 30% of the vote, primarily on the strength of his showing in his native Lee County.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=736120 |title=FL District 19 – R Primary Race – Aug 14, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns  |accessdate=November 7, 2012}}</ref>

In the general election Radel faced Democrat Jim Roach of Cape Coral, a retired [[General Motors|GM]] research engineer and Vietnam veteran.  However, Radel was heavily favored to win.  The 19th has long been reckoned as one of the most Republican districts in Florida, and as such the Republican primary was considered the real contest for the election.  In 2008, Republican presidential nominee [[John McCain]] won the district with 57% of the vote. In 2010, [[Rick Scott]] won the district with 61% of the vote.
