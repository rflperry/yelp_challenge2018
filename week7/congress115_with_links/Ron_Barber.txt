'''Ronald Sylvester Barber''' (born August 25, 1945) is an [[United States|American]] politician. He was a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from 2012 to 2015. Barber, a member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] from [[Arizona]], served as district director for U.S. Representative [[Gabrielle Giffords]] before Giffords resigned her seat due to the severe injuries she sustained in an [[2011 Tucson shooting|assassination attempt]], during which Barber was also injured.

In 2012, following the resignation of Giffords, Barber decided to seek election to the seat. On June 12, 2012, he defeated Jesse Kelly, an [[Iraq War]] veteran, in a [[special election]].<ref name=specialelectionwin/><ref name=swearingin1>{{cite news|last=Myers|first=Amanda Lee |agency= [[Associated Press]] |title= Jesse Kelly 'Reflecting' after Losing to Ron Barber in Race to Replace Gabrielle Giffords |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/06/13/jesse-kelly-ron-barber-gabrielle-giffords-az-special-election-results_n_1594750.html |accessdate= June 14, 2012 |publisher= The Huffington Post |date= June 13, 2012}}</ref><ref>[https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gxb-URnnsq8p1UTqiR7VnCQ7DBjQ?docId=CNG.3ff6b80e76f3a531701730d791b3fa9f.361 "Barber sworn-in to succeed Gabby Giffords."], Google News.

On March 19, 2012, Barber announced that he would run for a full term in the district, which had been renumbered as the 2nd District, in the 2012 general election.<ref name="campaignbio">[http://ronbarberforcongress.com/meet-ron/ Campaign Biography]</ref> The district was, at least on paper, slightly more Democratic than its predecessor.<ref name=nj>{{cite web|url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|title=House Democrats Gain With New Arizona Map|date=October 5, 2011|accessdate=October 7, 2011|work=[[National Journal]]|first=Jessica|last=Taylor|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111006163330/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2011/10/house-democrats.php|archivedate=October 6, 2011|df=mdy-all}}</ref> However, his race against Republican [[Martha McSally]] was one of the closest in the nation. McSally led on election night by a few hundred votes, but the race was initially too close to call due to a large number of provisional ballots. Barber eventually overtook McSally as more ballots were counted. By November 16, most of the outstanding ballots were in heavily Democratic precincts near Tucson. ''[[The Arizona Republic]]'' determined that as a result, McSally would not be able to pick up enough votes to overcome Barber's lead.<ref name=ArizonaRepublic>Nowicki, Dan; D'Anna, Jon.

Barber ran for re-election in 2014. The Democratic primary election took place on August 26, 2014, with the general election slated for November 4, 2014. [[Martha McSally]], whom Barber defeated in the 2012 election, won the Republican primary.<ref>{{cite web|title=Arizona's 2nd Congressional District elections, 2014|url=http://web1.ballotpedia.org/Arizona%27s_2nd_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|publisher=Ballotpedia|accessdate=March 19, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=McSally pilots easy Arizona GOP primary win to face Democratic Rep.

With 100% of the votes counted, McSally had a 161-vote lead and declared victory on November 12, 2014, but due to the fact that the margin of victory was less than 1%, an automatic recount was legally required.
