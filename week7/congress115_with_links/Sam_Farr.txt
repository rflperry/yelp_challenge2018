===Legislation===
*Farr introduced the "Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st century Act" ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr21: H.R. 21]) in January 2007. The bill would consolidate national management of oceans, creating a system of regional governance; make the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration the chief oceans agency; creates an ocean advisor in the president's Cabinet; creates regional and national ocean advisory committees; and create an Oceans and Great Lakes Conservation Trust Fund. It received a subcommittee markup in April 2008 and passed by a vote of 11–3.<ref>[https://archive.is/20120913222636/http://www.reuters.com/article/pressRelease/idUS142606+06-Mar-2008+MW20080306] "Ocean Champions Community Pushes for OCEANS-21 Bill," ''Reuters''.</ref>
*Farr's "Reconstruction and Stabilization Civilian Management Act of 2008" ([http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr1084: H.R. 1084]) was approved by the House but stalled in the Senate. The bill would create capacity within the State Department to quickly deploy civilian expertise and coordinate the government response to crises abroad. President [George W. Bush] supports the program and approved initial creation of the group. Farr participated in a rollout of the group with Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice in July 2008.<ref>[https://www.state.gov/secretary/rm/2008/07/107083.htm] "Remarks At the Civilian Response Corps Rollout," State Department.</ref>

[[File:Sam Farr, official portrait, 111th Congress.jpg|thumb|Sam Farr]]
*Oceans. Farr is a proponent of ocean protection and conservation.

*Gas prices. Farr opposes opening new areas to offshore drilling, instead supporting the drilling of {{convert|68000000|acre|km2}} of federally owned land already under lease, including {{convert|33000000|acre|km2}} on the Outer Continental Shelf. Farr also supports ending subsidies to oil companies.<ref>[http://thecalifornian.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20080731/NEWS01/807310304/1002]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} "Poll: Residents back oil drilling off state's coast," Salinas Californian"</ref>
*Base Realignment and Closure. Farr has worked closely with Central Coast cities and the Army on the reuse of the former Fort Ord. He was integral in securing $29 million for the creation of California State University-Monterey Bay. He also played a role in making sure land on the former installation included significant amounts of affordable housing.
*Immigration. Farr supports comprehensive immigration reform that includes a guest worker program for farm workers, allowing [[undocumented students]] to remain in the country (known as the [[DREAM Act]]), and deporting undocumented felons in U.S. jails.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=418 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730214144/http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=418 |archivedate=July 30, 2008 |df=mdy-all }} Immigration (Summer 2008 E-Newsletter)</ref>

===Foreign Affairs===

Farr is a cosponsor on several bills including [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hres1329: H.Res. 1329], which supports a timetable for troop withdrawal, and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr5626: H.R. 5626] and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr4959: H.R 4959], which call for congressional approval for any long-term agreements with Iraq.<ref>[http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=411 Iraq and Iran (Summer 2008 E-Newsletter)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080730214228/http://www.farr.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=411 |date=July 30, 2008 }}</ref>
*Iran. Farr has been vocal in efforts to prevent military action against Iran. He is a cosponsor of H. Con. Res 33, which would require congressional approval before any incursion into Iran, and [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:hr3119: H.R. 3119], a bill to prohibit the use of funds for military operations in Iran.
*Colombia. Farr has parlayed his experience in Colombia to become a congressional leader on Colombian affairs. He was an active supporter of rebalancing funds dedicated to Plan Colombia, the U.S. anti-drug effort, to include more support for economic redevelopment efforts. He has hosted a wide range of Colombian political leaders in his Washington office including current President Álvaro Uribe and former President Andrés Pastrana.

===Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) comment===
On February 26, 2008, at the [[United States House Appropriations Subcommittee on Homeland Security|House Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee]] hearing, Farr said "the public image of (the ICE agents)" has become "not (a) compassionate law enforcement agency but essentially a [[Gestapo]]-type agency that is knocking down doors"<ref name="Salinas lawmaker attacked over Gestapo remark">{{cite web|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/centralcoast/ci_8434872?nclick_check=1|title=Salinas lawmaker attacked over Gestapo remark|accessdate=March 7, 2008}}</ref> when conducting raids on illegal immigrants. [[U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement|Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] [[Julie Myers]] responded to Farr's comments by saying, "We are not the Gestapo. The men and women of this agency have a very difficult job...and I think they do that with distinction and great honor.".<ref name="House panel urges faster deportation of jailed illegal immigrants">{{cite web|url=http://www.govexec.com/story_page.cfm?articleid=39368&dcn=todaysnews|title=House panel urges faster deportation of jailed illegal immigrants|accessdate=February 26, 2008}}</ref> Farr replied that he knew and appreciated this, but reiterated that there is "there is a very ill will public opinion in the counties (he) represent(s), about ICE".

===H.Res. 333===
[[File:Congressman Sam Farr and Luci Baines Johnson.jpg|thumb|(L-R) Congressman Farr and [[Luci Baines Johnson]] at the [[Bixby Creek Bridge]] in 2015]]
On July 12, 2007, Farr joined 11 cosponsors (18 as of August 15, 2007) of H.Res. 333, introduced in Congress, that lays out three articles of impeachment against Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. The bill maintains that the vice president purposely manipulated the intelligence process to deceive the citizens and Congress of the United States (1) by fabricating a threat of Iraqi weapons of mass destruction and (2) about an alleged relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda in order to justify the use of the United States Armed Forces against the nation of Iraq in a manner damaging to our national security interests and (3) that Cheney has openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran absent any real threat to the United States. (see http://congress.gov for more details on H.Res. 333)

"Many residents in the Central Coast support the removal of Cheney from office, and I am proud to represent their values in Congress," Farr said in a brief statement.<ref>[http://www.montereyherald.com/ci_6355617?nclick_check=1]</ref>

==Awards==
On July 30, 2007, Farr received the Senator David Pryor Special Achievement Award for his ongoing advocacy for communities with military bases presented by the Association of Defense Communities. The award is given to an individual who advocates for communities with active or closed military bases. "Communities with active or closed military bases face many special concerns, from land use to economic development to ordnance disposal," said Farr. "I have been lucky enough to assist in the transition efforts at Fort Ord, and that experience has helped me push those issues locally and nationwide." As vice-chair of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Farr successfully increased clean-up funds from $221 million to $271 million for military bases closed prior to 2005 [https://web.archive.org/web/20071028144339/http://thecalifornian.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20070730%2FNEWS01%2F70730017%2F1002].
