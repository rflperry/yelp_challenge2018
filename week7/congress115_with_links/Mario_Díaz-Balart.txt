'''Mario Rafael Díaz-Balart Caballero''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|l|ɑːr|t}}; born September 25, 1961) is a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[Florida's 25th congressional district]]. Elected in 2002, his current district includes much of southwestern [[Miami-Dade County]], including the city of [[Hialeah]], and much of the northern portion of the Everglades.

==Early life, education, and early political career==
Díaz-Balart was born in 1961 in [[Fort Lauderdale]], to Cuban parents, the late [[Cuba]]n politician [[Rafael Díaz-Balart]], and his wife, Hilda Caballero Brunet. His aunt, [[Mirta Díaz-Balart]], was the first wife of [[Fidel Castro]]. Her son, and his cousin, was [[Fidel Castro Díaz-Balart|Fidel Ángel "Fidelito" Castro Díaz-Balart]]. His uncle is the Cuban-Spanish painter, [[Waldo Díaz-Balart]]. His brother, [[Lincoln Díaz-Balart]], represented Florida's 21st District from 1993 to 2011. He has two other brothers, [[Jose Diaz-Balart|José Díaz-Balart]], a journalist, and Rafael Díaz-Balart, a banker.

He studied [[political science]] at the [[University of South Florida]] before beginning his public service career as an aide to then-[[Miami]] Mayor [[Xavier Suárez]] in 1985. In the same year, he changed his political party affiliation from [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] to Republican.<ref>"Díaz-Balart Se Pasa Al Partido Republicano", ''El Nuevo Herald'', April 24, 1985.{{es icon}}</ref>

===Elections===
;2002–2006
Díaz-Balart gave up his seat in the state house to run in the newly created 25th District, which included most of western [[Miami-Dade County]], part of [[Collier County]] and the mainland portion of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politifact.com/florida/statements/2010/dec/21/ellen-freidin/districts/|title=Reform advocate says "dozens'' of Florida political districts split counties and splinter cities|author=Laura Figueroa|publisher=PolitiFact.com|accessdate=Feb 19, 2018}}</ref> He easily won the seat with 64 percent of the vote. He was unopposed for reelection in 2004, and won a third term with 58 percent of the vote in 2006.

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 21}}
On February 11, 2010, Díaz-Balart announced his intention to seek election in [[Florida's 21st congressional district]]—being vacated by his brother, Rep. [[Lincoln Díaz-Balart]]—rather than the 25th district.<ref name="rollcall1">{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/43199-1.html?type=printer_friendly|title=Mario Díaz-Balart Will Run to Succeed His Brother|publisher=Roll Call|date=2010-02-11|accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> Unlike the 25th, the 21st has long been considered the most Republican district in the Miami area.

;2018
The ''Miami Herald'' reported in April 2018 that Díaz-Balart seemed a shoo-in for re-election in November. Former Hialeah mayor Raúl Martínez, a Democrat, said that Díaz-Balart's district "is very hard to win for a Democrat, especially if you're not Hispanic and you don't speak Spanish." Valdes, who had lost to him in 2016, was a candidate in the Democratic primary.<ref>Daugherty, Alex; Democrats face long odds in effort to topple Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart; Miami Herald; April 11, 2018; https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article208616809.html</ref> In April, Annisa Karim, who is active in the Democratic Party, announced that she too would run in the primary. In May, the ''Herald'' reported that Mary Barzee Flores, a former judge who had at first chosen to run in the 27th district, had decided instead to run for Díaz-Balart's seat.<ref>Daugherty, Alex; Democrat Mary Barzee Flores switches races to challenge Republican Mario Diaz-Balart; Miami Herald; May 3, 2018; https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/article210394744.html</ref>

In January 2018, after it was reported that Trump had voiced his opposition to immigration from [[Haiti]], [[El Salvador]], and African countries - which he reportedly referred to as "shithole countries" - in a meeting on immigration reform, Díaz-Balart, who attended the meeting, did not say whether the alleged incident took place.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/01/12/mario-diaz-balart-sidesteps-trumps-vulgarity/|title=Mario Diaz-Balart sidesteps Trump’s vulgarity|last=Leary|first=Alex|work=Tampa Bay Times|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en-US}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://miami.cbslocal.com/2018/01/15/rep-diaz-balart-remains-mum-on-trumps-shole-remark/|title=Rep.

===Foreign policy===

====Cuba====
In 2007, Díaz-Balart advocated maintaining the [[Cuban embargo]], saying "Some people do not understand the embargo of Cuba. Its purpose is to keep American [[hard currency]] out of the hands of a Communist thug by restricting most trade and travel."<ref>[http://www.house.gov/mariodiaz-balart/news/columns/071104_nydailynewscuba.htm] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070404065604/http://www.house.gov/mariodiaz-balart/news/columns/071104_nydailynewscuba.htm|date=April 4, 2007}} {{dead link|date=January 2018}}</ref>

In an April 2015 essay for ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, Díaz-Balart wrote that President Obama "continues to appease brutal dictatorships while gaining precious little in return. He conflates the Cuban dictatorship with the Cuban people when in reality, their interests are diametrically opposed." Díaz-Balart noted that "all eight Cuban-American senators and congressmen from both sides of the aisle, strongly disagree" with Obama's policy on Cuba, whose people "want to gather peacefully, speak their minds, practice their faiths, access the Internet, and enjoy the fruits of their labor."<ref>Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart: Obama's Cuba Policy Is Enabling a Dictator; TIME; April 21, 2015; http://time.com/3825781/mario-diaz-balart-obamas-cuba-policy/</ref>

In September 2016, Díaz-Balart praised Republican presidential candidate [[Donald Trump]] "for firmly stating his commitment today to reverse President Obama's capitulations to the Castro regime" and contrasted Trump's position to what he called [[Hillary Clinton]]'s "foolhardy stance." The U.S., he said, needs "a president who once again will stand with the Cuban people instead of emboldening and enriching their oppressors."<ref>O'Reilly, Andrew; FL Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart commends Trump for hard-line stance on Cuba; Fox News; September 19, 2016; http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/19/florida-diaz-balart-commends-trump-for-hardline-stance-on-cuba.html</ref>

In a March 2017 memo to the Trump White House, Díaz-Balart argued that if the Cuban government did not conform to the [[Helms-Burton law]] within 90 days, the U.S. should revert to its pre-Obama policy on Cuba.<ref>Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart’s memo to the White House RE: Cuba policy changes; Global Americans; March 23, 2017; https://theglobalamericans.org/2017/03/congressman-mario-diaz-balarts-memo-white-house-re-cuba-policy-changes/</ref>

====Falklands====
Díaz-Balart has strongly supported the [[right of self-determination]] on the [[Falkland Islands]], over which there is a [[Falkland Islands sovereignty dispute|sovereignty dispute]] between [[Argentina]] and the [[United Kingdom]].<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=2016-05-05 |title=Strong Support for the Falklands Right to Self Determination on North American Tour |url=http://en.mercopress.com/2016/05/05/strong-support-for-the-falkland-s-right-to-self-determination-on-north-american-tour |work=[[MercoPress]] |location= |access-date=2016-05-05 }}</ref> On April 18, 2013, Díaz-Balart introduced a resolution to the [[United States House of Representatives]] calling on the [[United States Government]] to officially recognize the result of the [[2013 Falkland Islands sovereignty referendum]] in which the [[Falkland Islanders]] overwhelmingly voted to remain a [[British Overseas Territory]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-resolution/170|title=H.Res.170 - 113th Congress (2013-2014): Recognizing the Falkland Islands referendum in favor of retaining their status as a British Overseas Territory.|last=Mario|first=Diaz-Balart,|date=2013-06-07|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref> Díaz-Balart introduced a similar resolution in 2017, recognizing the result of that [[Falkland Islands general election, 2017|year's general election]] in the Falklands.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-resolution/650|title=H.Res.650 - 115th Congress (2017-2018): Recognizing the results of the free and fair elections for the new Members of the Legislative Assembly of the Falkland Islands held on November 9, 2017.|last=Mario|first=Diaz-Balart,|date=2017-12-07|website=www.congress.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-03-01}}</ref>

=== Immigration and refugees ===
In 2014, the ''Washington Post'' reported that Díaz-Balart was "eagerly seeking a deal" on undocumented immigrants "that can somehow please enough Republicans and Democrats to advance. And that upsets many Democrats and Republicans." After being "involved in bipartisan talks on the issue for years," he was "one of the guys most skilled on the issue" and hence "gets plenty of flack from both sides." Díaz-Balart told the ''Post'' that "President Obama said that this was going to be one of his first priorities in his first 12 months," but even when "Democrats controlled everything," nothing got done "because they didn't want to do it."<ref>O'Keefe, Ed; Mario Diaz-Balart on immigration: ‘We need to get the support of enough people or we’re dead’; Washington Post; February 6, 2014; https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2014/02/06/mario-diaz-balart-on-immigration-we-need-to-get-the-support-of-enough-people-or-were-dead/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.13ef0ec0e36c</ref>

Díaz-Balart supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that "The ban is only temporary until the Administration can review and enact the necessary procedures to vet immigrants from these countries. The ban is based on countries the Obama administration identified as 'countries of concern' and not based on a religious test."<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump’s travel ban; here’s where the rest stand|website=Denver Post|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|accessdate=January 30, 2017}}</ref>

=== Gun policy ===
In the aftermath of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]] on February 14, 2018, in [[Parkland, Florida]], Díaz-Balart said gun control legislation would not be effective at stopping mass shootings, saying "I want to make sure we look at things that could make a difference."<ref name="TampaBayTimes1">{{cite web|url=http://www.tampabay.com/florida-politics/buzz/2018/02/16/nra-backed-marco-rubio-say-gun-control-laws-wont-prevent-mass-shootings/|title=NRA-backed Marco Rubio says gun control laws alone won’t prevent mass shootings|website=Tampa Bay Times|last1=Daugherty|first1=Alex|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}</ref> Between 1998 and February 2018, Díaz-Balart, received $27,450 in campaign contributions from the [[National Rifle Association]], returning $3,000 of those donations.<ref name="WashingtonPost2">{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/national/nra-donations/|title=Have your representatives in Congress received donations from the NRA?|website=Washington Post|last1=Williams|first1=Aaron|accessdate=February 19, 2018}}</ref>

===Espionage===
Díaz-Balart took part in a November 2013 meeting between American legislators and the European Parliament's foreign affairs committee about [[NSA]] spying on European officials. Díaz-Balart told his European counterparts that they should realize that the U.S. is their greatest ally. “Part of re-establishing trust,” he said, “is to know who your friends are and treat them accordingly, and to know who your enemies are and treat them accordingly.”<ref>Keating, Dave; US lawmakers promise to rein in NSA snooping; Politico; November 27, 2013; https://www.politico.eu/article/us-lawmakers-promise-to-rein-in-nsa-snooping/</ref>
