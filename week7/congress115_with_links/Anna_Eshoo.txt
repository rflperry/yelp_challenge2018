====Human rights====
Eshoo is a strong supporter of the [[gay rights]] movement. In 1992, when a [[gay-bashing]] mailer was directed at Supervisor Tom Nolan (the first openly gay supervisor in San Mateo and her opponent for her congressional seat), Eshoo stood fast in defending him, his record and years of service. She opposed the [http://www.thomas.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:h.j.res.00106: Marriage Protection Amendment] and the [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d108:H.R.3313: Marriage Protection Act]. Her website called the bill "discriminatory, singling out for the first time a minority to prevent their interests from being considered by the highest courts in the land."<ref>Anna Eshoo's [http://eshoo.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=229&Itemid=46#National stance on civil rights]</ref>

As one of just two [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] members of Congress, Eshoo has worked hard to protect indigenous [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] [[Christians]] in [[Iraq]] from continuing [[religious persecution]] and political exclusion. She authored an amendment to H.R. 2601, the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-2601 Foreign Relations Authorization Act], stating that "special attention should be paid to the welfare of Chaldo-Assyrians and other indigenous Christians in Iraq."<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/amendment.xpd?session=109&amdt=h483 Amendment 483 to Hr. 2601] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101224185324/http://www.govtrack.us/congress/amendment.xpd?session=109&amdt=h483 |date=December 24, 2010 }}</ref>

Eshoo has been a strong supporter of the Congressional resolution recognizing the [[Armenian genocide]]. She also supports closer ties between Armenia and the U.S.

Eshoo has fought strongly against certain provisions of the [[Patriot Act]], particularly Section 215 (Access to Business Records), which gives federal investigators the right to obtain any tangible business record without a subpoena.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Eshoo also introduced "[[Kevin's law|Kevin's Law]]," which would have given the U.S. Department of Agriculture the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat.

As an Assyrian and Armenian American, Eshoo is co-chair and co-founder of the Religious Minorities in the Middle East Caucus. She also serves on the Board of Advisors of [http://www.religionandpolicy.org/ THE INSTITUTE on Religion and Public Policy], a freedom of religion organization.

====Immigration====
Eshoo has worked to create a legal "pathway to citizenship" for [[foreign worker]]s of all kinds, from doctors and computer programmers to migrant farm workers. She has voted to increase the annual cap on [[H-1B visa]]s to allow more temporary foreign professionals to work in the United States (especially those with [[Master's Degrees]] or higher).

In California, where as much as 90% of the agricultural workforce is composed of illegal immigrants,<ref>Study by the [http://www.dol.gov/ Department of Labor]</ref> Eshoo cosponsored H.R. 371, the [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h110-371 Agricultural Jobs Act], which would confer blue-card status on illegal immigrants who had worked an agricultural job in the United States for 150 days or more. This bill never became law.

====National security====
On July 29, 2015, Eshoo co-introduced H.R. 3299, the [[Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act of 2015]], which would streamline government decisions and provide incentives for vaccines and treatment of dangerous pathogens and diseases.<ref>{{cite news |title=Health Subcommittee holds markup on the Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act |url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/18994-health-subcommittee-holds-markup-on-the-strengthening-public-health-emergency-response-act/|accessdate=June 24, 2016|work=Homeland Preparedness News|date=June 8, 2016}}</ref> Eshoo co-sponsored the legislation with lead sponsor Rep.

"By putting the broadband conduit in place while the ground beneath the roadways is exposed, we will enable any authorized communications provider to come in later and install fiber-optic cable at far less cost."<ref name=hr2428_announce /> The bill is supported by [[Google]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://googlepublicpolicy.blogspot.com/2009/06/google-submits-initial-comments.html|title=Google submits initial comments supporting a National Broadband Plan|authors =Richard Whitt, Washington Telecom and Media Counsel, [[Google]]|date=June 8, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://moderator.appspot.com/#15/e=a4977&t=a60d6 |title=Submit your ideas for a National Broadband Plan|author =Richard Whitt, Google |date=June 8, 2009}}</ref>

Eshoo supported the [[Federal Communications Commission Process Reform Act of 2013 (H.R. 3675; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would make a number of changes to procedures that the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) follows in its rulemaking processes.<ref name=3675cbo>{{cite web|title=H.R. 3675 – CBO|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45057|publisher=Congressional Budget Office |accessdate=March 10, 2014}}</ref> The FCC would have to act more transparently as a result of this bill, forced to accept public input about regulations.<ref name=PeteVotesTransparency>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House votes for more transparency at the FCC|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/200503-house-votes-for-more-transparency-at-the-fcc |accessdate=March 12, 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=March 11, 2014}}</ref> Eshoo expected Senate support for the bill, saying that they "shouldn't find it menacing" and arguing that the bill was "about the functioning of the FCC in the 21st century."<ref name=bachmanAdWeek>{{cite news|last=Bachman|first=Katy|title=Bipartisan FCC Process Reform Bill Gains Momentum |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/technology/bipartisan-fcc-process-reform-bill-gains-momentum-154441|accessdate=March 12, 2014 |newspaper=Ad Week|date=December 11, 2013}}</ref>
