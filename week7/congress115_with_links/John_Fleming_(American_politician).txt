While he was still young, his mother became disabled and could no longer work. Just prior to Fleming's high school graduation, Fleming's father died of a [[Myocardial infarction|heart attack]]. This forced him to finance his education with odd jobs and loans.<ref name="houmatoday.com">{{cite web|last1=Sentell|first1=Will|title=Candidate profile: U.S. Senate candidate John Fleming of Louisiana|url=http://www.houmatoday.com/elections/20161019/candidate-profile-us-senate-candidate-john-fleming-of-louisiana|website=houmatoday.com|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}</ref> Fleming attended the [[University of Mississippi]] at [[Oxford, Mississippi|Oxford]], where he was a member of the [[Phi Delta Theta Fraternity]].

==Medical career==
Fleming was chief resident in [[family medicine]] at the Naval Regional Medical Center in [[Marine Corps Base Camp Pendleton|Camp Pendleton]], California. He also trained at the drug and alcohol treatment unit at the Navy Regional Medical Center in [[Long Beach, California]].<ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627>{{cite news|accessdate=November 22, 2008|url=http://www.meridianstar.com/local/local_story_178002646.html|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128161504/http://www.meridianstar.com/local/local_story_178002646.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=January 28, 2013|date=June 27, 2007|title=Meridian native named Family Doctor of Year|first=Ida |last=Brown |work=The Meridian Star}}</ref> Serving in the Navy after his residency, Fleming practiced family medicine on the island of [[Guam]].<ref>''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'', November 18, 1982, p. 14</ref> From 1979 to 1981, he was the director of drug and alcohol treatment and chairman of the Navy Family Advocacy Committee. He subsequently performed similar duties in [[Charleston, South Carolina]].<ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627/>

After leaving the Navy, Fleming established a practice in [[Minden, Louisiana|Minden]] in August 1982. His first clinic was on Pearl Street across from the [[United States Post Office]]. He chose Minden for his city of residence because, in his words, it "has small-town charm, warm essence of life, long, lazy summer days with watermelon cuts and family reunions."<ref>''Minden Press-Herald'', August 10, 1982, p. 1</ref> To attract patients to his new practice, Fleming announced evening and Saturday morning hours to accommodate working people and students.<ref>''Minden Press-Herald'', September 2, 1982, p. 10</ref>

Fleming is [[board certified]] by the [[American Board of Family Medicine]]<ref name=MeridianStar_Brown_20070627/> He joined the staff of the Minden Medical Center.<ref name=MindenHospital_Staff>{{cite web|accessdate=November 23, 2008|url=http://www.mindenmedicalcenter.com/news/?page_id=18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302135059/http://www.mindenmedicalcenter.com/news/?page_id=18|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 2, 2009|title=Physicians |publisher=Minden Medical Center}}</ref> Fleming is also a member of the [[American Academy of Family Physicians]] (AAFP) and the Louisiana Academy of Family Physicians (LAFP).

Fleming previously worked with chemically dependent persons through the program called "New Beginnings" at the Minden Medical Center.<ref>"Dr. Fleming will help chemical dependents", ''Minden Press-Herald'', October 18, 1987, p. 10</ref> In 1994, the ''[[Minden Press-Herald]]'' revealed Dr. Fleming's call "to end violence and drug addiction. I link these two together because I believe most of the violence we see is caused by addiction to, or buying and selling of drugs."<ref>Fannie Moore, "Citizens list top priorities for 1994", ''Minden Press-Herald'', January 6, 1994, p. 1.</ref>

In 2006, Fleming wrote ''Preventing Addiction: What Parents Must Know to Immunize Their Kids Against Drug And Alcohol Addiction.'' In the book, Fleming argues that alcohol, among other addicting substances, can serve as a gateway for broader and more problematic drug use, and that the immature brain development of children make them vulnerable to drug addiction later in life. Therefore, delaying the use of alcohol and other addicting substances until later adolescence or adulthood can sharply reduce the risk of later addiction according to scientific studies initiated by the [[National Institute on Drug Abuse]] and others.<ref name="books.google.ca">Fleming, John C.

As such he introduced legislation to raise the price of the [[Federal Duck Stamp]] by $10 to $25, bringing the stamp in line with inflation as an increase had not occurred for many years.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Masson|first1=Todd|title=House passes bill to jack up price of duck stamp|url=http://www.nola.com/outdoors/index.ssf/2014/11/house_passes_bill_to_jack_up_p.html |accessdate=May 22, 2017|agency=The Times-Picayune|date=November 18, 2014}}</ref> The purpose of the legislation was to preserve habitat in critical migratory waterfowl flyways to allow duck populations to grow. The legislation was supported by hunting groups, including [[Ducks Unlimited]], the [[National Rifle Association]], and the [[Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Before the House Natural Resources Committee, Subcommittee on Fisheries, Wildlife, Oceans, and Insular Affairs Concerning: H.R. 5069, The Federal Duck Stamp Act of 2014|url=http://naturalresources.house.gov/uploadedfiles/schmidttestimony7-23-14.pdf|website=Congress.gov|publisher=House of Representatives|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}</ref> The Fleming Duck Stamp bill passed the House and Senate by voice vote and was signed into law by [[President Obama]] on December 18, 2014, as it had broad bipartisan support.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.5069 - Federal Duck Stamp Act of 2014|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/5069/actions|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 22, 2017}}</ref> Hunters and conservationists liked it as it generated more revenue to preserve habitat for waterfowl.

====Stagg courthouse naming====
On April 4, 2016, Fleming introduced the "Tom Stagg Federal Building and United States Courthouse" bill.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.5011 - To designate the Federal building and United States courthouse located at 300 Fannin Street in Shreveport, Louisiana, as the "Tom Stagg Federal Building and United States Courthouse" |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/5011/text/ih?q=%7B%22search%22%3A%5B%22fleming%22%5D%7D&r=4|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 29, 2017}}</ref> It was named for the Honorable [[Tom Stagg|Thomas Eaton Stagg Jr.]], who served with distinction as judge for the federal court in 1984 to 2015.

====Amtrak Secure Transportation of Firearms====
On October 13, 2009, Fleming introduced the Amtrak Secure Transportation of Firearms Act.<ref>{{cite web|title=Amtrak Secure Transportation of Firearms Act|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-bill/3789|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 29, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Alarkon|first1=Walter|title=Fight to allow weapons aboard Amtrak trains could derail transportation bill|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/64663-gun-fight-over-amtrak-could-put-transportation-spending-bill-off-the-legislative-tracks|accessdate=May 29, 2017|date=October 25, 2009}}</ref> It was supported by the [[National Rifle Association]].<ref>{{cite news|last1=Mark|first1=Schone|title=Congress: Passengers Can Bring Guns on Amtrak Trains|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/congress-passengers-bring-guns-amtrak-trains/story?id=9290167|accessdate=May 29, 2017|date=December 9, 2009}}</ref> The bill passed the House and Senate and was signed into law by [[President Obama]] in December 2009.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Pergram|first1=Chad|title=President Signs Bill That Allows Gun-Slinging Amtrak Passengers to be Locked in Boxes|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2009/12/16/president-signs-bill-that-allows-gun-slinging-amtrak-passengers-to-be-locked-in.html|accessdate=May 29, 2017|date=December 16, 2009}}</ref>

====Conscience Protection Act of 2016====
On March 22, 2016, Fleming introduced the Conscience Protection Act of 2016 which "amends the Public Health Service Act to codify the prohibition against the federal government and state and local governments that receive federal financial assistance for health-related activities penalizing or discriminating against a health care provider based on the provider's refusal to be involved in, or provide coverage for, abortion."<ref>{{cite web|title=The Conscience Protection Act of 2016|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/4828|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref> If enacted it would give access to courts (heretofore unavailable) by healthcare providers who feel they have been discriminated against because of their refusal (based on conscience) to provide abortion services. For legislative expediency the text was put into a Senate [[shell bill]]
S. 304. It was ultimately passed by the House and Senate, but President Obama refused to sign it into law.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Conscience Protection Act of 2016|url=https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/114/s304|website=Govtrack.us|accessdate=May 31, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Messer|first1=Luke|title=House Amendment to S. 304, Conscience Protection Act of 2016|url=https://policy.house.gov/legislative/bills/house-amendment-s-304-conscience-protection-act-2016|website=RPC|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Eaton|first1=Sabrina|title=House passes 'Conscience Protection Act' to oppose abortion|url=http://www.cleveland.com/metro/index.ssf/2016/07/house_passes_conscience_protec.html |accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=July 13, 2016}}</ref>

====The Abortion Non-Discrimination Act (ANDA)====
By federal law, federal funding is required to be withheld from states who do not enforce the Weldon Amendment that prevents discrimination against healthcare providers if they refuse to provide abortion services.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/civil-rights/for-individuals/conscience-protections/factsheet/index.html|website=HHS.GOV |title=Overview of Federal Statutory Health Care Provider Conscience Protections |accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref> In 2014, California began enforcing a 1975 state law requiring all insurance companies to charge and cover all [[subscribers]] for abortion services, even if they object based on [[religious]] or [[conscience]] beliefs. [[President Obama]] refused to enforce the federal statute against this, violating the Weldon Amendment in the opinion of Fleming and many others.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Sullivan|first1=Peter|title=Republicans accuse Obama of failing to enforce abortion law|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/267396-republicans-accuse-obama-of-failing-to-enforce-abortion-law|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=January 29, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Kaiser Health News|url=http://khn.org/morning-breakout/california-abortion-coverage/|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=August 25, 2014}}</ref> Fleming introduced legislation to provide health insurance subscribers a choice to purchase plans that do not cover abortions.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Gehrke|first1=Joel|title=GOP Rep: Leadership Blocked Bill Protecting Churches from Funding Abortion |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/394360/gop-rep-leadership-blocked-bill-protecting-churches-funding-abortion-joel-gehrke|accessdate=June 1, 2017|publisher=National Review |date=December 10, 2014}}</ref>

====Seniors' Tax Simplification Act of 2015====
With each congressional session, Fleming introduced this bill designed to improve convenience and lower tax-filing costs to seniors. Though a senior's income may be limited to only [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] benefits, the [[IRS]] requires all [[senior citizens]] to use the long [[form 1040]] to file taxes. This act was designed to reduce the senior taxpayer filing to one simple page saving time, complexity and cost.<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.1397 - Seniors' Tax Simplification Act of 2015|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/1397|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=ATR Supports Tax Simplification for Seniors|url=https://www.atr.org/atr-supports-tax-simplification-seniors|website=Americans for Tax Reform|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref>

====H. Res. 615 of 2009====
During the debate over healthcare reform in Congress in 2009, Congressman Fleming recognized that members of Congress were likely to be exempted from the mandates and higher premiums expected from the [[Affordable Care Act]], also known as [[Obamacare]].<ref>{{cite news|title=Overwhelming Evidence That Obamacare Caused Premiums To Increase Substantially|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/theapothecary/2016/07/28/overwhelming-evidence-that-obamacare-caused-premiums-to-increase-substantially/#5bc6d0ab15be|accessdate=June 2, 2017|date=July 28, 2016}}</ref> On July 13, 2009, he introduced H. Res. 615, "expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that members who vote in favor of the establishment of a public, federal government-run health insurance option are urged to forgo their right to participate in the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) and agree to enroll under that public option."<ref>{{cite web|title=H.Res.615|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/111th-congress/house-resolution/615|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref> The resolution created a public outcry, after an interview of Fleming by Fox News' Meghan Kelly, demanding that members of Congress should also be subject to [[Obamacare]]. Consequently, language was placed in the [[Affordable Care Act]] requiring members of Congress and their staff to leave the more affordable [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program]] with much lower premiums and deductibles, and obtain healthcare insurance through the [[DC Health Link|DC Exchange]], a product of the [[Affordable Care Act]].<ref>{{cite news|title=What Happens To A Congressman's Health Insurance If Obamacare Goes Down?|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2017/04/12/523335954/what-happens-to-a-congressmans-health-insurance-if-obamacare-goes-down|accessdate=June 2, 2017|agency=NPR}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |last1=Livingston |first1=Shelby|title=Insurance premiums have doubled since 2013, but policies are more generous |url=http://www.modernhealthcare.com/article/20170524/NEWS/170529951|accessdate=June 2, 2017 |date=May 24, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Kelly|first1=Meghan|title=Congressman Fleming Discusses H Res 615 with Meghan Kelly on Fox News|agency=Fox News|date=July 16, 2009}}</ref>

====American Health Care Reform Act of 2013====
The [[Affordable Care Act]] ([[Obamacare]]) was signed into law in 2010. Dr. Fleming was vociferously opposed to, and voted against the health care law. He and his House Republican colleagues voted at full strength over fifty times to repeal the unpopular<ref>{{cite news|title=More Americans Disapprove Than Approve of Health Care Law|url=http://www.people-press.org/2016/04/27/more-americans-disapprove-than-approve-of-health-care-law/|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=April 27, 2017}}</ref> law prior to 2017.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Berenson |first1=Tessa|title=Reminder: The House Voted to Repeal Obamacare More Than 50 Times prior to 2017.|url=http://time.com/4712725/ahca-house-repeal-votes-obamacare/|accessdate=June 1, 2017|date=March 24, 2017}}</ref> Citing the over eighteen new taxes, mandates on employers and individuals, and the newly mandated set of [[essential health benefits]]; Fleming emphasized how [[Obamacare]] would damage the economy and reduce access to affordable healthcare for many and fail to provide promised coverage for more Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=Full List of Obamacare Tax Hikes|url=https://www.atr.org/grover-norquist-educates-science-guy-bill-nye-about-real-costs-paris-climate-deal|website=ATR|accessdate=June 2, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1310/27/sotu.01.html|website=cnn.com |title=State of the Union with Candy Crowley |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref> He also called [[Obamacare]] "the most dangerous piece of legislation ever passed by Congress."

In September 2013, Congressman Fleming helped write, cosponsored and introduced the [[Republican Study Committee]]'s [[American Health Care Reform Act of 2013]] and again in 2015, which would repeal the soon-to-be-implemented [[Affordable Care Act]]. Instead of raising taxes, adding mandates and creating massive amounts of regulations to the healthcare system, the [[American Health Care Reform Act of 2013]] was designed to increase competition among providers by taking down state line barriers for health insurance, creating price transparency, tax equity between individual and employer plans, and liberalizing [[health savings account]]s. It would create large [[purchasing cooperative|buying co-ops]] for small businesses, and form strong [[risk pool|high risk pools]] among other mechanisms to deal with [[Pre-existing condition|pre-existing illness]].<ref>{{cite web|title=H.R.3121 - American Health Care Reform Act of 2013|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/3121|website=Congress.gov|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref>

The [[Affordable Care Act|ACA]] sharply restricted the use of [[health savings account]]s, though they had been popular since their inception in 2003.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ramthun|first1=Roy|title=Why Is Obamacare Regulating Health Savings Accounts Out of Existence? |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/433639/health-savings-accounts-obamacare-affordable-care-act-killing-hsa|accessdate=June 2, 2017|date=April 5, 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=History of Health Savings Accounts (HSAs)|url=http://www.afcm.org/hsahistory.html|website=Americans for Free Choice in Medicine|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}</ref> In 2013, Congressman Fleming introduced Helping Save Americans' Health Care Choices Act, an expansion of [[health savings account]]s in healthcare policy.

==== Tax cuts and increases ====
The [[Bush tax cuts]] enacted in 2001 and 2003 could not be made permanent because they were passed under [[Reconciliation (United States Congress)|Budget Reconciliation]]. They expired in 2010 but were renewed temporarily for two years through the bipartisan compromise [[Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010]]. This led to the eventual passage of the [[American Taxpayer Relief Act of 2012|President Obama's Proposed Plan to Increase Taxes]] which kept taxes low on lower income earners but raised taxes above the [[Bush Tax Cuts]] rate on [[small businesses]] and higher earners. Congressman Fleming was outspoken on the subject supporting tax cuts for all Americans. He agreed with many economists who said tax increases would damage the economy and jobs, and that federal taxes and spending should be cut to achieve a faster American [[economic growth]] rate.<ref>{{cite web|title=Effects of Income Tax Changes on Economic Growth MORE|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/effects-of-income-tax-changes-on-economic-growth/|website=Brookings.edu|accessdate=June 6, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Club for Growth PAC Congratulates Rep.

In a September 19, 2011, interview on [[MSNBC]] in which Fleming was critical of President Obama's proposed plan to increase taxes, he was questioned about the reported $6.3 million of gross [[revenues]] his private restaurant company received the previous year. Fleming responded to host [[Chris Jansing]] by saying, "that's before you pay 500 employees, you pay rent, you pay equipment, and food" [[Overhead (business)|(business overhead)]]; "the actual net income was a mere fraction of that...It is more like $600,000 of that $6.3 million...So by the time I feed my family I have, maybe $400,000 left over to invest in new locations, upgrade my locations, buy more equipment."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Seitz-Wald|first1=Alex|title=Multi-Millionaire Rep.

Fleming's remarks were widely reported and resulted in considerable commentary.

===Activities in Congress led by Fleming===

====Co-founder of the [[Freedom Caucus|House Freedom Caucus]]====
Fleming, and his fellow [[congressional]] Republicans, began the [[111th Congress]] in 2009 with Democrats attaining a [[supermajority]] in the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] and [[United States Senate|Senate]], and the [[President of the United States|Presidency]]. In reaction to a series of [[Progressivism|progressive]] bills enacted into law including the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|Stimulus bill]], the [[Affordable Care Act]], and the [[Dodd-Frank Act]]; [[Conservatism|conservatives]] across America created a number of local activist groups, collectively called the [[Tea Party Movement]]. Republicans in the House and their supporters became determined to regain the House to stop the sudden progressive shift in federal government policy. Republican House members, led by then [[House Minority Leader]] [[John Boehner]], created the [[Pledge to America]] that outlined a [[Party platform|platform]] to reverse the growth in government spending as well as to repeal the Affordable Care Act, the Dodd-Frank Act and other items. During the 2010 elections, many House Republican candidates ran on the [[Pledge to America]] platform with enthusiastic support from the [[Tea Party Movement]]. The 2010 election year ended with Republicans taking the majority by winning 63 seats from Democrats.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Peoples|first1=Steve|title=Final House Race Decided; GOP Net Gain: 63 Seats|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-201279-1.html|accessdate=June 8, 2017 |agency=Roll Call|date=December 8, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Tom|title=5 years later, here's how the tea party changed politics |url=http://www.cnn.com/2014/02/27/politics/tea-party-greatest-hits/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=CNN Politics|date=February 28, 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|last1=Ray|first1=Michael|title=Tea Party movement|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Tea-Party-movement|website=Encyclopaedia Britannica|accessdate=June 8, 2017}}</ref>

The high expectations of conservative constituents of Republican House members, generally, and Speaker [[John Boehner]], particularly; led to conflict and division among House members. A number of conservative members from within the House [[Republican Study Committee]], began to resist initiatives led by Speaker Boehner when he appeared to be overly cooperative (in the view of conservatives) with House Democrats and [[President Obama]] on issues like taxes, the [[Affordable Care Act]] and [[illegal immigration]] and appeared to be not committed to the [[Pledge to America]]. When Speaker Boehner was reluctantly forced by conservative members to lead a [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013|shutdown]] of the federal government over the implementation and funding of the [[Affordable Care Act]], [[John Boehner]] began to retaliate against individual Republican members who were critical of Boehner and the rest of the House leadership for not adequately (in the view of conservatives) resisting the progressive policies of [[President Obama]] and congressional Democrats. Retaliations ranged from removing House members from [[congressional committees]] and positions of committee leadership, to supporting Republican primary candidates to oppose them. Also, the [[Republican Study Committee]], through its open policy to all Republican members (growing to over 170 members), transitioned from a smaller conservative group to one that aligned itself with the more [[The Establishment|establishment]]-oriented policies of Speaker Boehner.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Buck|first1=Ken|title=Freedom Caucus member reveals GOP's 'vindictive retaliation'|url=https://nypost.com/2017/04/08/freedom-caucus-member-exposes-gops-vindictive-retaliation/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=New York Post|date=April 8, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Wong|first1=Scott|title=Boehner defends retaliation against unruly Republican members|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/245958-boehner-defends-retaliation-against-unruly-members|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=The Hill|date=June 15, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Martosko|first1=David|title=The speaker's revenge: John Boehner punishes conservative Republicans who 'p***ed him off' by trying to oust him by removing high-profile committee posts |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2899963/Welcome-new-USSR-Conservative-Republicans-lose-committee-assignments-retaliation-voting-against-Speaker-John-Boehner-contentious-leadership-election.html |accessdate=June 8, 2017 |agency=Daily Mail |date=January 6, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=French|first1=Lauren|title=Conservatives split off from Republican Study Committee|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/01/conservatives-split-off-from-republican-study-committee-114222|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=Politico|date=January 13, 2015}}</ref>

In January 2015, feeling that the [[Republican Study Committee]] had become too [[The Establishment|establishment]]-aligned and insufficiently conservative, and citing Speaker Boehner's continued political battle against conservative members; nine House members came together in a series of meetings to consider and ultimately create a more nimble, consistently conservative group consisting of approximately 40 conservative House members. They formed an official congressional caucus and named it the [[Freedom Caucus|House Freedom Caucus]].

Though rarely done, it is a [[privileged motion]] meaning that any member can submit and trigger a series of [[parliamentary procedure]]s culminating in a new vote for Speaker of the House.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Bialik|first1=Carl|title=The Hard-Line Republicans Who Pushed John Boehner Out|url=https://fivethirtyeight.com/datalab/the-hard-line-republicans-who-pushed-john-boehner-out/|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=FiveThirtyEight|date=September 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Dickinson|first1=Tim|title=Meet the Right-Wing Rebels Who Overthrew John Boehner|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/news/meet-the-right-wing-rebels-who-overthrew-john-boehner-20151006|accessdate=June 8, 2017|agency=The Rolling Stone|date=October 6, 2015}}</ref> The motion accelerated the pressure on Boehner, whose popularity had declined considerably, nationally and among House Republicans in general.

====Attempt to impeach the [[Commissioner of Internal Revenue|Commissioner of the IRS]]====
Soon after the [[Tea Party Movement]] began in 2009, local and national Tea Party organizations began to complain that the [[Internal Revenue Service|IRS]] would not approve their applications for [[Tax exemption|tax exempt status]], a certification necessary for the [[wikt:viability|viability]] of [[nonprofit organization]]s. In 2013, [[Lois Lerner]], a high level IRS employee, disclosed as  Director of Rulings and Agreements in the Exempt Organizations, that the [[conservatism|conservative]] Tea Party organizations were targeted by the IRS to be denied tax exempt status while [[liberalism|liberal]] groups were given the appropriate certifications. This created the appearance that Lerner was using her power in the IRS for political and ideological benefit. Because of the [[IRS targeting controversy]], Lerner was forced to retire and [[John Koskinen]] was appointed to replace the acting Commissioner to restore integrity of the IRS.<ref>{{cite news|title=Rep. Fleming: Impeach the IRS commissioner|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/opinion/2016/09/14/impeach-irs-commissioner-john-koskinen-john-fleming-editorials-debates/90333680/|accessdate=June 10, 2017|agency=USA Today|date=September 14, 2016}}</ref>

Investigations into the [[IRS targeting controversy]] were held by the [[United States House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform|House Oversight Committee]], chaired by [[Jason Chaffetz]]. Koskinen was instructed to protect and turn over all records relating to the controversy. However, under Koskinen, the vast amount of documentation, including computer backup tapes, were destroyed. Chaffetz issued a document to begin [[impeachment]] proceedings against Koskinen saying, "he failed to comply with a congressionally issued subpoena, documents were destroyed on his watch, and the public was consistently misled. Impeachment is the appropriate tool to restore public confidence in the IRS and to protect the institutional interests of Congress."<ref>{{cite news|title=House Republicans introduce measure to impeach IRS Commissioner Koskinen|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/10/27/house-republicans-introduce-measure-to-impeach-irs-commissioner-koskinen.html|accessdate=June 10, 2017|agency=Fox News Politics|date=October 27, 2015}}</ref> However, Republican House leadership did not bring the impeachment to the floor for a vote.<ref name="foxnews.com">{{cite news|title=IRS boss Koskinen takes heat at impeachment hearing for faulty testimony|url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2016/09/21/irs-boss-koskinen-admits-failings-at-impeachment-hearing.html|accessdate=June 10, 2017|agency=Fox News Politics|date=September 21, 2016}}</ref>

With the support of the House [[Freedom Caucus]], Fleming utilized a rarely-used [[parliamentary procedure]] called a [[privileged motion]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Robert's Rules|url=http://www.rulesonline.com/rror-03.htm|website=RulesOnline.com|accessdate=June 10, 2017}}</ref> to force a vote on impeachment of Koskinen.

==== Social media to connect with constituents ====
As Fleming entered Congress in 2009, use of [[social media]] such as [[Facebook]] and [[Twitter]] emerged as methods for members to connect directly with their constituents.  In 2010 the [[Republican Conference of the United States House of Representatives|House Republican Conference]] created the "New Media Challenge" to spur Republican members to acquire more followers. Fleming was awarded first place in both 2010 ad 2011 by his Republican peers.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Moire|first1=Jennifer|title=Who's Winning The Facebook War On Capitol Hill?|url=http://www.adweek.com/digital/whos-winning-the-facebook-war-on-capitol-hill/ |agency=Adweek |date=July 8, 2011 |accessdate=June 9, 2017}}</ref>

====Work on religion in the military====
Beginning about 2005, critics claimed that Christians in the military caught [[proselytism|proselytizing]] should be [[court-martial]]ed. Subsequently, military members came forward claiming they were being punished by their military superiors for what they viewed as reasonable religious expression, a violation of the [[First Amendment]].<ref>{{cite web|last1=Bowers|first1=Becky|title=Bloggers say Pentagon may court-martial Christian soldiers|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2013/may/06/blog-posting/bloggers-say-pentagon-may-court-martial-christian-/|website=Politifact|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|last1=Yu|first1=Annie|title=Christians under siege push for more freedom of expression in military|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/jul/17/proponents-of-religion-push-for-more-freedom-of-ex/|accessdate=June 20, 2017|agency=Washington Times|date=July 17, 2013}}</ref> In June 2013, Fleming sponsored an amendment to the 2014 [[National Defense Authorization Act]] requiring the military "to accommodate, except in cases of military necessity, actions and speech, reflecting the conscience, moral principles, or religious beliefs of the member." The amendment drew objections from the White House, with a spokesman saying that commanders need discretion to, "address potentially problematic speech and actions within their units" and that the measure would "have a significant adverse effect on good order, discipline, morale and mission accomplishment." The amendment passed with a bipartisan vote by the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]]. A similar measure passed the Senate and compromise language was adopted into the final [[National Defense Authorization Act|NDAA]] signed into law.<ref name=www.NOLA.com>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/06/fleming_proposal_to_require_fr.html/|title=Fleming proposal to require free religious expression in military draws White House objections|publisher=The Times-Picayune|date=June 12, 2013}}</ref><ref name="huffingtonpost.com"/><ref name="cmrlink.org"/>

The Army [[Chaplain]] Corps was implemented July 29, 1775, by George Washington, then the general of the [[Continental Army]]. Of chaplains Washington said, "Common decency, Sir, in a camp calls for the services of a divine, and which ought not to be dispensed with, altho' the world should be so uncharitable as to think us void of religion, and incapable of good instructions."<ref>{{cite web|title=George Washington on Chaplain's Importance Thereof|url=http://www.ministers-best-friend.com/George-Washington-on-CHAPLAINS-IMPORTANCE-Thereof.html|website=Ministers-best-friend.com|accessdate=June 20, 2017}}</ref> By definition a [[chaplain]] is a religious minister assigned to a secular institution.

Fleming said, "The notion of an atheist chaplain is nonsensical; it's an oxymoron." Democratic Congressman [[Rob Andrews]] of New Jersey said that it was "wrong" to tell an [[Irreligion|irreligious]] service member that they "must go to a mental health professional in order to receive counseling, rather than someone who comes from their philosophical faith or tradition."<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2013/07/house_passes_fleming_measure_t.html|title=House passes Rep.

====[[Budget Control Act of 2011]] and [[United States budget sequestration in 2013|budget sequestration of 2013]]====
After Republicans took control of the [[United States House of Representatives]] In 2011, a debate emerged over how to bring deficit spending under control after it ballooned to over $1.3 trillion annually from 2009-2011.<ref>{{cite web|last1=de Rugy|first1=Veronique|title=Debt and Deficit under Obama Administration|url=https://www.mercatus.org/publications/debt-and-deficit-under-obama-administration|website=George Mason University|accessdate=June 7, 2017}}</ref> A compromise deal was struck, called the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]], between Republican [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] and [[President Obama]] that would create a [[bipartisan]] and [[bicameral]] [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|"super committee"]] in Congress to decide how to equitably lower [[discretionary spending]]. According to the act, automatic and substantial cuts would be made to both national defense and non-defense [[discretionary spending]] in the federal budget if the committee did not come to an agreement to specific and targeted budget cuts.

===Political positions===

====Abortion====
Fleming was a staunch advocate in protecting unborn human life. He voted against taxpayer funding of abortion through the [[Affordable Care Act]], [[Planned Parenthood]] and other programs that fund abortion through federal tax dollars. He opposed the use of abortion to choose sex, gender, color or race of the child, or the race of a parent.<ref name="Fleming on Abortion">{{cite web|title=Fleming on Abortion|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/John_Fleming_Abortion.htm|website=On the Issues|accessdate=June 16, 2017}}</ref>

====Religious liberty====
In support of religious liberty and right of conscience, Fleming supported the company, [[Hobby Lobby]], in its position to refuse to fund, through its healthcare insurance program, abortion or [[abortifacients]] for its employees under the [[Affordable Care Act]]. The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] ultimately ruled in favor of Hobby Lobby.

In 2012, before the ''[[Obergefell v.

(Fort Polk, a [[U.S. Army base]], lies within Fleming's congressional district.) Fleming said that the ceremony "should not have occurred at Fort Polk, especially since the people of Louisiana have made it abundantly clear that our state does not recognize same-sex marriages or civil unions" and characterized the event as part of a "liberal social experiment with our military."<ref>Alan Duke, [http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/07/us/army-same-sex-ceremony/ Same-sex ceremony on Army post draws fire], CNN (June 7, 2012).</ref>

==Health and Human Services tenure==
After completing four terms in the [[United States House of Representatives]], Dr. Fleming was appointed Deputy Secretary of Health Technology Reform in [[Health and Human Services]] on March 23, 2017, by [[President Donald Trump]]. On being appointed, Fleming said, "I just want to be a part of taking down the barriers that are preventing innovation (in healthcare)."<ref>{{cite news|last1=Rainey|first1=Richard|title=Former Louisiana Rep. John Fleming to join HHS under Trump|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/03/former_louisiana_rep_john_flem.html |accessdate=May 30, 2017|date=March 20, 2017}}</ref> During his private medical practice work, Fleming was an early adopter of (EHRs) [[Electronic Health Records]]. He implemented his first system in 1997 and said his practice was fully [[paperless office|paperless]] by 1999.<ref>{{cite web|title=Leadership Bios|url=https://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/john-fleming-md|website=HealthIT.gov|accessdate=May 29, 2017}}</ref> He was assigned, primarily, to the [[Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology|Office of the National Coordinator]], an agency within HHS. Fleming noted that for years after implementing his EHR, adoption rates of EHRs among his healthcare colleagues remained low until the implementation of the [[Health Information Technology for Economic and Clinical Health Act|HITECH Act]] in 2009 in which around $30 billion in cash incentives were used to encourage [[health professionals]] to purchase EHRs. He reported that by 2017 adoption rates among hospitals was over 95% and over 85% among physician offices.<ref name="healthcare-informatics.com">{{cite news|last1=Leventhal|first1=Rajiv|title=HHS' New Health IT Lead Speaks Out on EHR Usability, Interoperability|url=https://www.healthcare-informatics.com/article/interoperability/hhs-new-health-it-lead-speaks-out-ehr-usability-interoperability|accessdate=May 29, 2017|date=May 25, 2017}}</ref>

Fleming has been a strong advocate of technology [[innovation]] and believes "the future of healthcare technology is tied to two core goals: improving the [[usability]] of health IT systems and [[interoperability]]." He also stated that [[interoperability]] "would be sparked by every American having a single, unified health record that resides in the cloud." He lamented the problems with the current [[fractionated]] nature of EHRs being disbursed among a myriad of healthcare providers tends to defeat the purpose of [[information technology]] to improve access to medical information and [[healthcare]] in general.<ref name="healthcare-informatics.com"/><ref>{{cite news|title=Former Rep. Fleming Named to HHS Health Technology Post |url=https://ehrintelligence.com/news/former-rep.-fleming-named-to-hhs-health-technology-post |date=March 21, 2017 |accessdate=May 30, 2017}}</ref>

Related to technology, Fleming advocated (ACOs) [[accountable care organization]]s as a method to streamline healthcare purchasing instead of the traditional [[fee for service]] system still mostly used today. Of [[fee for service]] Fleming said, "If you're paying for service, you'll get service, whether the outcomes are good or not." He has supported the need to produce and use data to improve the quality and [[cost effectiveness]] of healthcare as evidenced by the statement, "how do you pay for outcomes without good data? We need better methods for getting data into the system and delivering it to you, and we're working on doing that. There is a good marriage between [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|pay-for-value]] and data".<ref name="healthcare-informatics.com"/>
