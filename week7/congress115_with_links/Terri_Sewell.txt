==Early life and education==
Terrycina Sewell, known as "Terri," was raised in Selma, Alabama. She is the daughter of the late Andrew A. Sewell, a former high school basketball coach, and Nancy Gardner Sewell, a retired high school librarian and former City Councilwoman in Selma. Her mother was the first black woman elected to the Selma City Council.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/lifestyle/style/rep-terri-sewell-a-daughter-of-selma-rues-her-citys-lost-promise/2015/03/01/38025310-bdeb-11e4-bdfa-b8e8f594e6ee_story.html|title=Rep. Terri Sewell, a daughter of Selma, rues her city's lost promise|last=Thompson|first=Krissah|date=March 1, 2015|work=Washington Post|access-date=|via=}}</ref> Both parents held careers in the Selma public school system.

Sewell was the first black valedictorian of [[Selma High School]]. Her mother's family was politically active, offering its homestead to activists who came for the 1965 [[Selma to Montgomery marches]] to gain voting rights. Sewell spent her childhood summers in [[Lowndes County, Alabama]] with her maternal grandparents. Her grandfather, a [[Primitive Baptist]] minister and a farmer, instilled in her a love for the land, an appreciation of hard work, and the importance of her faith. Her grandfather and the members of Beulah Primitive Baptist Church gave her a deep understanding of the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt Region]] and its people.

Sewell graduated with honors from [[Princeton University]] and received a scholarship from ''[[U.S. News and World Report]]'', among others. A lifelong [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], during the summers while in college, she worked on Capitol Hill for [[AL-07|7th congressional district]] congressman [[Richard Shelby]], as well as for Senator [[Howell Heflin]]. She was a leader on the college campus, serving in various roles including class vice-president, class representative to the Student Union, and spearheading the admission office's effort to set up a Minority Student Recruitment office to recruit more minority students to the university.<ref>{{cite news|last=Che|first=Erica|title=Sewell '86 launches historic campaign for Congress|url=http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/2009/04/08/23305/|accessdate=22 August 2010|newspaper=The Daily Princetonian|date=April 8, 2009}}</ref>

Upon graduation from college, Sewell was featured on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Today (NBC program)|Today Show]]'' as one of the "Top Collegian Women." She was chosen as one of the "Top Ten College Women in America" by ''[[Glamour Magazine]]''. She received the Afro-American Studies Thesis Prize for her senior thesis, ''Black Women in Politics: Our Time Has Come,'' which featured a personal interview with [[Shirley Chisholm]], the first black U.S. Congresswoman.<ref>{{cite news|last=Olopade|first=Dayo|title=Tomorrow's Crop of Black Women Leaders|url=http://www.theroot.com/views/tomorrows-crop-black-women-leaders|accessdate=August 22, 2010|newspaper=The Root|date=May 5, 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101118033156/http://www.theroot.com/views/tomorrows-crop-black-women-leaders|archivedate=November 18, 2010|df=}}</ref> Sewell continued her education, receiving a master's degree with first-class Honours from [[Oxford University]] with the support of a [[Marshall Scholarship]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Rep.

Sewell attended [[Harvard Law School]] with the help of an [[NAACP Legal Defense Fund]] scholarship, graduating in 1992. In law school, she served as an editor of the ''[[Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review]].''<ref>{{cite web|url=http://harvardcrcl.org/ |title=Harvard Civil Rights-Civil Liberties Law Review |publisher=Law.harvard.edu |date= |accessdate=2010-07-11}}</ref> She published an article titled "Selma, Lord, Selma," about the legal struggles in Selma, in the [http://www.law.harvard.edu/students/orgs/blj/ ''Harvard Black Letter Journal''], (vol. 8, Spring 1991).

Clemon |publisher=Encyclopedia of Alabama |date= |accessdate=2010-08-22}}</ref> United States District Court (AL-ND), who was the first black federal judge appointed in Alabama.

Sewell began her legal career in 1994 at the [[Wall Street]] law firm of [[Davis Polk & Wardwell]]. A securities lawyer for more than a decade, she gained experience in finance and the capital markets. Sewell provided free legal services to the homeless, mentored girls of color in NYC high schools through the program Dreams into Action, and served on the [https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005021/http://www.seo-usa.org/index.aspx Alumni Advisory Board of Sponsors of Educational Opportunity] (SEO), a not-for-profit organization providing education, leadership training and Wall Street internships to students of color. Through her involvement with SEO, she served as the co-chair of the Community Assistance Fund, which provided $300,000,000 of aid and assistance to organizations serving communities of color affected by the events of [[September 11, 2001]].

Sewell returned to Alabama in 2004 to assist her mother in the care of her father. As the first black female partner in the Birmingham law firm of [[Maynard, Cooper & Gale, P.C.|Maynard, Cooper, & Gale, P.C.]], Sewell has distinguished herself as one of the only black [[public finance]] lawyers in the State of Alabama. She served as a lawyer helping to raise money for public projects for some of the state's most underserved public entities, many in [[Alabama's 7th congressional district]], including the City of [[Selma, Alabama|Selma]], Dallas County Water Authority, and Lowndes County Board of Education. Sewell made educational finance a particular focus of her practice, representing the historically black colleges in Alabama, including [[Alabama State University]], [[Tuskegee University]], and [[Stillman College]], as well as other higher education institutions such as [[Wallace State Community College|Wallace State-Hanceville]], [[Jefferson State Community College]], [[Chattahoochee Valley Community College]], and the State of Alabama's Public Schools and University Authority.
