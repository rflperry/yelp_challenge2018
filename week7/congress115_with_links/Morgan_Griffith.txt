==Early life, education, and career==
Griffith was born in [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]], but his family moved to [[Salem, Virginia]] while he was a baby. He attended Andrew Lewis High School, graduating in 1976. He attended [[Emory and Henry College]], graduating in 1980. Griffith completed his education with a [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] from the [[Washington and Lee University School of Law]] in 1983.<ref name=CQ>{{cite news|title=112th Congress: Morgan Griffith, R-Va.

After law school, Griffith settled in Salem where he worked as a private [[Lawyer|attorney]] with a focus on [[traffic violation]]s and [[Driving under the influence|DUI]]. On June 23, 2008, Albo & Oblon LLP, a law firm run by fellow Republican delegate [[Dave Albo]], announced that Griffith was joining the firm as head of its new Roanoke/Salem office.<ref>{{cite web|title=H. Morgan Griffith to join Albo & Oblon LLP|publisher=MarketWatch, Inc.|date=2008-06-23|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/h-morgan-griffith-join-albo/story.aspx?guid=%7B8B6D5087-BF8C-4C58-8C9E-564E9770A2AF%7D|accessdate=2008-08-15}}</ref>

==Early political career==
Griffith first became seriously involved in politics in 1986, when he was chosen as the chairman of the Salem Republican Party. He held that position from 1986 to 1988 and from 1991 to 1994.

==Virginia House of Delegates==
In 1993, Griffith was elected to the Virginia House of Delegates, defeating Democrat Howard C. Packett. He served as the Vice-Chairman of the Rules Committee in the House of Delegates. He served on the Courts of Justice Committee, and was the chairman of its Criminal Law Subcommittee. He also served on the Commerce and Labor and the Militia, Police, and Public Safety Committees.<ref>{{cite web|title=Virginia House of Delegates: Session 2002: Griffith, H.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Virginia, 2010#District 9}}
Griffith was the Republican nominee to face longtime U.S. Congressman [[Rick Boucher]], who was first elected in 1982. His home in Salem was just outside the 9th's borders at the time; it was in the [[Virginia's 6th congressional district|6th District]] of fellow Republican [[Bob Goodlatte]]. However, most of his House of Delegates district was in the 9th.

Griffith jumped into the race after Boucher voted for the [[American Clean Energy and Security Act|cap and trade]] bill.  Boucher made much of the fact that Griffith didn't live in the district. In turn, Griffith branded Boucher as a rubber stamp for [[Barack Obama]] and [[Nancy Pelosi]]. Griffith narrowly won the election.<ref name=election>{{cite news|title=GOP's Griffith ousts 14-term Va.

===Health care===
Early in 2010, Griffith voted in favor of a bill to prohibit any [[individual mandate]] to purchase [[health insurance]].<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=28657&can_id=5148 Project Vote Smart]</ref> This law passed Virginia's legislature before the federal [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] was enacted, which Virginia has used to challenge the individual mandate in federal court.<ref>[http://www.healthleadersmedia.com/content_redirect.cfm?content_id=252184 www.healthleadersmedia.com]</ref> However, on July 17, 2013 Griffith was the lone GOP member of the House to vote against delaying the implementation of the individual mandate.<ref>[https://www.usnews.com/news/articles/2013/07/17/house-votes-to-postpone-individual-mandate-2 U.S. News & World Report: "House votes to postpone individual mandate"]</ref>

Just prior to the [[United States federal government shutdown of 2013]], Griffith issued press release in which he endorsed the final House version of [[Continuing Appropriations Resolution, 2014]], which would have continued funding for  federal government operations while delaying implementation of the Affordable Care Act.<ref>[http://morgangriffith.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=351857 "Griffith Statement on Latest House Efforts to Keep the Government Open"]</ref> Griffith voted against the [[Continuing Appropriations Act, 2014]], the Senate-proposed compromise that ended the shutdown without defunding the Affordable Care Act.<ref>[http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2013/roll550.xml Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives: Final Vote Results for Roll Call 550]</ref>

===Abortion===
When surveyed in 1999 on his political positions by [[Project Vote Smart]], Griffith indicated that he supports legalized [[abortion]] in the [[first trimester]] and to save the life of the mother,<ref name="vs5148">[http://www.votesmart.org/npat.php?can_id=5148 Project Vote Smart]</ref> while favoring the restriction of abortion through [[Parental notification|parental notification laws]] and prohibition of [[partial-birth abortion]]. Griffith's voting record has generally been consistent with his 1999 survey, voting in favor of restrictions on late term abortions such as parental-notification and parental-consent, while voting against bills that would restrict first-term abortions. In 2010 Griffith voted to restrict state funding of abortions,<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=30562&can_id=5148 Project Vote Smart]</ref> and to require [[abortion clinic]]s to meet the same licensing requirements as surgical centers. In 2006 Griffith voted to restrict state funding for [[Embryonic stem cell|fetal stem cell research]].<ref>[http://www.votesmart.org/issue_keyvote_detail.php?cs_id=5237&can_id=5148 Project Vote Smart]</ref>

In 2007 Griffith voted against <ref>[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?071+vot+HV0657+HB2797 Virginia State Legislature archives]</ref> a bill in the [[Virginia General Assembly]], HB 2797, which stated: ''"That life begins at the moment of fertilization and the right to enjoyment of life guaranteed by Article 1, § 1 of the Constitution of Virginia is vested in each born and preborn human being from the moment of fertilization"''<ref>[http://leg1.state.va.us/cgi-bin/legp504.exe?071+ful+HB2797 Virginia State Legislature archives]</ref>

Griffith's 2010 campaign website reported that Griffith has a "100% pro-life" voting record and an "A" rating from the [[Virginia Society for Human Life]] (VSHL). However, VSHL's report on 2007 legislation in Virginia omits reference to HB 2797<ref>[http://www.12cups.org/vshlpac/vshl.org/elections/2007/2007_Va_House_of_Delegates_Vote_Key.shtml www.12cups.org] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724202816/http://www.12cups.org/vshlpac/vshl.org/elections/2007/2007_Va_House_of_Delegates_Vote_Key.shtml |date=2011-07-24 }}</ref> Project Vote Smart indicated that Griffith declined to take their survey again in 2010.<ref name="vs5148" />

===Taxes and spending===
Griffith supports raising the retirement age and reducing the number of American troops serving overseas as means of reducing the federal budget deficit.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.tricities.com/news/2011/jul/14/local-congressmen-react-debt-talks-ar-1172832/ |title=Local congressmen react to debt talks |author=Melissa Hipolit|date= 14 July 2011|work= TriCities.com|publisher= |accessdate=18 July 2011}}</ref>  Most recently, Griffith voted in favor of the November 2017 tax plan.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/11/16/us/politics/house-vote-republican-tax-bill.html/ |title=How Every Member Voted on the House Tax Bill|author=K.K. REBECCA LAI|date= 16 November 2017|work= New York Times|publisher= |accessdate=2 December 2017}}</ref>

===Medical marijuana===
In 2014, Griffith introduced legislation to move marijuana from a Schedule I to a Schedule II narcotic, which would effectively make the drug legal for medical purposes under federal law.<ref>{{cite news|last=Jackman|first=Tom|title=Va. Rep. Griffith introduces federal ‘Legitimate Use of Medicinal Marijuana Act’|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/local/wp/2014/04/30/va-rep-griffith-introduces-federal-legitimate-use-of-medicinal-marijuana-act/|accessdate=2 May 2014|newspaper=Washington Post|date=30 April 2014}}</ref>

Griffith is married to the former Hilary Davis. The couple has three children. He is [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]].<ref>[http://votesmart.org/candidate/5148/morgan-griffith#.UgIobNI3tMc]</ref>
