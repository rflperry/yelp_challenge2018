Yoder sponsored the Fairness for High-Skilled Immigrants Act, which  would remove the per-nation cap on employment-based green cards, which the [[Cato Institute]] estimates is causing a backlog of anywhere between 230,000 and 2 million Indian nationals in the system, forcing them to wait between 50 and 250 years for green cards.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.cato.org/blog/no-one-knows-how-long-legal-immigrants-will-have-wait|title=No One Knows How Long Legal Immigrants Will Have to Wait|date=2016-07-28|work=Cato Institute|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}</ref> The text of the bill was successfully adopted into Yoder's must-pass Homeland Security Appropriations bill in July.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://appropriations.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=395388|title=Appropriations Committee Approves Fiscal Year 2019 Homeland Security Funding Bill {{!}} Committee on Appropriations, U.S. House of Representatives|website=appropriations.house.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-27}}</ref>

====  Health care ====
Yoder opposes the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/House/Kevin_Yoder_Health_Care.htm|title=Kevin Yoder on Health Care|website=www.ontheissues.org|access-date=2017-03-22}}</ref> On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the act and pass the [[American Health Care Act of 2017|American Health Care Act]].<ref name=":02">{{Cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/politics/ahca-house-vote/|title=How the House voted to pass the GOP health-care bill|website=Washington Post|access-date=2017-05-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/04/health-care-vote-puts-pressure-dozens-vulnerable-gop-reps/101297824/|title=Health care vote puts pressure on dozens of vulnerable GOP reps|work=USA TODAY|access-date=2017-05-04|language=en}}</ref> 

In March 2017, ''ProPublica'' reported that Yoder had said that the quality of health care in the country had declined due to the Affordable Care Act, an assertion that ''ProPublica'' found to be without proof and in contradiction to some data.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/we-fact-checked-lawmakers-letters-to-constituents-on-health-care|title=We Fact-Checked Lawmakers' Letters to Constituents on Health Care|last=Ornstein|first=Charles|date=2017-03-22|work=ProPublica|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}</ref>

====  Scientific research ====
Yoder has advocated for increased funding for biomedical research. In 2016, Yoder tried to convince "the most ardent or strident conservatives in the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] to get them to embrace research" as a fiscally and morally responsible thing to fund. More than 100 House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]], including conservative members like [[Dave Brat]], signed onto his letter to House leadership pushing for a $3 billion bump.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/01/national-institutes-of-health-congress-budget/423837/|title=What's Next for the National Institutes of Health?|last=Kelly|first=Nora|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> In the end, Congress provided the largest funding increase for research in 12 years.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.statnews.com/2015/12/16/congress-nih-funding-increase/|title=Congress gives big funding increase to NIH|date=2015-12-16|website=STAT|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> At the end of that year, he penned a guest column for [[Fox News]], arguing that support for cures to diseases and federal funding for medical research could be an issue to rally a divided country following the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2016/11/30/rep-kevin-yoder-heres-cause-to-unite-trump-and-clinton-voters.html|title=Rep.

In 2017, Yoder vocally opposed the Trump Administration's proposed budget cuts to the National Institutes of Health.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://yoder.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/yoder-to-fight-nih-cuts-in-administration-budget-proposal|title=Yoder to Fight NIH Cuts in Administration Budget Proposal|date=2017-03-16|work=Congressman Kevin Yoder|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}</ref> Instead, Yoder worked with colleagues on the House Appropriations Committee to secure another $2 billion funding increase for the NIH for Fiscal Year 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/the-new-gop-budget-rejects-trumps-cuts-to-nih/524895/|title=Congress Totally Ignored Trump's Cuts to NIH Funding|last=Kelly|first=Nora|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en-US}}</ref>

==== Technology ====

In 2017, Yoder voted for a [[Congressional Review Act]] resolution repealing an Obama-era [[Federal Communications Commission]] rule regarding internet privacy. Yoder broke ranks, siding with 190 Democrats (and 14 Republicans) when he voted against allowing internet providers to snoop on users and sell their personal online history.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article142045569.html|title=Editorial: Rep. Kevin Yoder distinguishing himself as an advocate for internet privacy|work=kansascity|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}</ref> 

In 2013, Yoder, along with Democrat Rep. [[Jared Polis]] (D-CO) introduced the [[Email Privacy Act]] which prevents law enforcement officials to access email communications without warrants.<ref>Tummarello, Kate (June 18, 2014).

Yoder also reintroduced the [[Murder of Kelsey Smith#Kelsey Smith Act|Kelsey Smith Act]], legislation that required cell phone carriers to provide location information to the authorities in situations involving "risk of death or serious physical injury."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://yoder.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/rep-yoder-reintroduces-kelsey-smith-act-to-help-prevent-violent-crimes|title=Rep.

==== Disaster aid ====
In September 2017, Yoder voted against a bipartisan deal to increase the debt ceiling while also providing relief to the communities devastated by Hurricane Harvey.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article172136677.html|title=KC area Republicans vote against Harvey relief, debt ceiling increase|work=kansascity|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}</ref> Earlier in the week, Yoder had voted for a clean disaster relief bill and cited his objections to the inclusion of the debt limit hike as his reason for opposing the eventual measure.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://yoder.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/yoder-statement-on-trump-pelosi-schumer-debt-limit-deal|title=Yoder Statement on Trump-Pelosi-Schumer Debt Limit Deal|date=2017-09-08|work=Congressman Kevin Yoder|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}</ref> Later in December, Yoder voted for a bipartisan $81 billion disaster package that 169 Democrats opposed.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/editorials/article191280949.html|title=Why did two Missouri Democrats in Congress vote against a disaster relief bill?|work=kansascity|access-date=2018-01-10|language=en}}</ref>

==== Environment ====
Regarding climate change, Yoder said in 2015, "Global warming is a concern that should be debated, but most proposals require huge amount of American sacrifice with little effect on global temperatures, and we should oppose those at every turn."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/opinion/opn-columns-blogs/steve-rose/article31129835.html|title=U.S. Rep. Kevin Yoder of Kansas is firmly in step with the GOP party line|work=kansascity|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}</ref>

Yoder supported President Trump's withdrawal from the [[Paris Agreement|Paris Climate Agreement]], saying that the costs of the agreement outweighed the benefits.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/article153900724.html|title=KC area Republicans applaud Trump's decision to exit climate deal ‚Äî with one exception|work=kansascity|access-date=2017-09-12|language=en}}</ref>

=== Social issues ===

==== Abortion ====

Yoder has a 100 percent voting record from the [[National Right to Life Committee]] for his abortion-related voting record.<ref name="VS2016">{{cite web|title=The Voter's Self Defense System|url=https://votesmart.org/candidate/political-courage-test/34433/kevin-yoder/#.WkR15lQ-dE4|website=Vote Smart|accessdate=28 December 2017}}</ref>

==== Cannabis ====

Yoder has a "D" rating from [[NORML]] for his voting history regarding [[cannabis]]-related causes. Yoder opposes veterans having access to medical marijuana if recommended by their [[Veterans Health Administration]] doctor and if it is legal for medicinal purposes in their state of residence.<ref name="NORML">{{cite web|title=Kansas Scorecard|url=http://norml.org/congressional-scorecard/kansas|website=NORML|accessdate=28 December 2017|language=en-us}}</ref>

==== LGBT ====

In 2017, Yoder split with President Trump, opposing his announced ban on transgender individuals serving openly in the military.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://cjonline.com/news/local/state-government/2017-07-26/us-reps-jenkins-yoder-split-trump-transgender-military-ban|title=U.S. Reps.

Yoder has a zero rating from the [[Human Rights Campaign]] for his LGBT rights voting record. Yoder opposes [[same-sex marriage]] and believes it was federal overreach legalizing it nationally.<ref name="VS2016" />

==Personal life==
Yoder and his wife, Brooke, live in [[Overland Park]] with their two daughters.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/home/kevin-yoder-new-baby|title=Kevin Yoder's Newest Addition|date=2015-11-16|website=Roll Call|access-date=2016-07-18}}</ref> They are members of the [[United Methodist Church of the Resurrection|Church of the Resurrection]] in [[Leawood, Kansas|Leawood]].

In February 2009, Yoder was pulled over for speeding on the [[K-10 (Kansas highway)|K-10 expressway]]. After passing a field sobriety test, Yoder declined the officer's request to take a roadside [[Breathalyzer]] test.  The officer cited Yoder for speeding and for refusing to take the breathalyzer test, and then let Yoder drive himself home. In a plea agreement, the speeding charge was dropped. Yoder pleaded guilty to refusing law enforcement's request for a breath test and paid a $165 fine.<ref>{{cite news|first=Justin|last=Campbell|url=http://www.pitch.com/news/article/20588513/kevin-yoder-pleaded-guilty-to-refusing-to-take-a-breath-test-refused-to-answer-kmbc-bulldog-mike-mahoneys-questions-video | title=Kevin Yoder Pleaded Guilty to Refusing Law Enforcement's Request For A Breath Test, refused to answer KMBC bulldog Mike Mahoney's questions (video) | work=The Pitch | date=October 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Carpenter|title=Yoder's '09 traffic stop clarified|date=October 25, 2010 |url=http://cjonline.com/news/local/2010-10-25/yoders_09_traffic_stop_clarified |work=Topeka Capital-Journal |accessdate=October 26, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=Tim|last=Carpenter |title=Yoder declined '09 breath test|date=October 23, 2010|url=http://cjonline.com/news/state/2010-10-23/yoder_declined_09_breath_test|work=Topeka Capital-Journal|accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|first=George|last=Diepenbrock|title=Yoder fined in 2009 for refusing Breathalyzer test|date=October 24, 2010 |url=http://www2.ljworld.com/news/2010/oct/24/kevin-yoder-fined-2009-refusing-breathalyzer-test/ |work=Lawrence Journal-World |accessdate=October 24, 2010}}</ref>

In 2012, [[Politico]] reported that about a year earlier, on August 4, 2011, Yoder partook in a late-night dip in the Sea of Galilee while on a fact-finding trip to the Holy Land. According to the report, about 20 of the 30 members of the trip joined in, with Yoder swimming without a bathing suit. Yoder apologized to his constituents and said in a statement that "it was dark out with visibility limited to only a few feet," and said he was in the water for about 10 seconds before climbing out.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/local/article307257/Congressman-Yoder-apologizes-for-swimming-nude-in-Sea-of-Galilee.html|title=Congressman Yoder apologizes for swimming nude in Sea of Galilee|work=kansascity|access-date=2018-01-16|language=en}}</ref> Yoder continued, "Part of the reason I made that decision at that moment was there was really nobody in the vicinity who could see me," he said. "I dove in, hopped right back out, put my clothes on and, regardless, that was still not the behavior people expected out of their congressman." The FBI investigated the matter, however neither Yoder or any member of his staff were interviewed. Then-House [[Majority Leader of the House of Representatives|Majority Leader]] [[Eric Cantor]], who was present, reprimanded Yoder for the incident.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/21/us/politics/after-skinny-dipping-in-israel-rep-kevin-yoder-is-rebuked.html|title=After Skinny-Dipping in Israel, Rep.
