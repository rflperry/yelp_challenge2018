'''Luis Vicente Gutiérrez''' (born December 10, 1953) is an American politician serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|Illinois|4|}} since 1993. From 1986 until his election to [[United States Congress|Congress]], he served as a member of the [[Chicago City Council]] representing the 26th ward. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]] and the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Caucus Members|author=|url=https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=71&sectiontree=2,71|format=|publisher=Congressional Progressive Caucus|date=|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref><ref name="La Voz 2">{{cite web|title=The Mastery of the Politics of Making the Impossible Possible |url=http://lavoz-prcc.org/2009/04/congressman-luis-v-gutierrez-the-mastery-of-the-politics-of-making-the-impossible-possible/|publisher=La Voz del Paseo Boricua|accessdate=July 5, 2011}}</ref> In the 113th Congress, with his 20 years of service, Gutiérrez became, along with [[Bobby Rush]], the longest serving member of the [[United States congressional delegations from Illinois|Illinois House delegation]], and so is occasionally referred to as the unofficial "dean" of the delegation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/z?r113:H11AP3-0050:/|title=Congressional Record - 113th Congress (2013-2014) - THOMAS (Library of Congress)|work=loc.gov}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutierrez.house.gov/sites/gutierrez.house.gov/files/documents/2013%20Short%20Biography.pdf |format=PDF |title=Short Biography of Rep.

==Early life, education, and early career==
Gutiérrez was born and raised in the [[Lincoln Park, Chicago|Lincoln Park]] neighborhood of Chicago, then an immigrant and working-class community. His mother was an assembly-line worker, and his father was a cab driver. After his freshman year at St. Michael's High School, his parents moved the family to their hometown of [[San Sebastián, Puerto Rico]]. Gutiérrez, who had never before visited the island, reluctantly followed his parents; there, he learned to speak Spanish. Gutiérrez said of his experience moving from Chicago to Puerto Rico: "In Lincoln Park, I had been called a spic, then, all of a sudden, I land on the island and everyone calls me ''gringo'' and ''Americanito''. I learned to speak Spanish well."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com">{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-06-04/features/8902060485_1_alderman-power-and-politics-el-gallito|title=`El Gallito`|last1=Casuso|first1=Jorge|date=June 4, 1989|accessdate=July 5, 2011|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|last2=Joravsky|first2=Ben}}</ref>

According to [[Mark Krikorian]], while Gutiérrez was in Puerto Rico, he was a member of the now-defunct [[Puerto Rican Socialist Party]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/426006/if-i-want-make-changes-i-have-infiltrate-system-mark-krikorian|title=‘If I Want to Make Changes, I Have to Infiltrate the System’ {{!}} National Review|date=2015-10-23|work=National Review|access-date=2018-08-13|language=en-US}}</ref>

In 1974, Gutiérrez returned to Chicago and enrolled at [[Northeastern Illinois University]]. He got involved in student activism and [[social justice]] issues, writing for the student publication ''Que Ondee Sola'' and serving as the president of the Union for Puerto Rican Students.<ref>{{cite news|title=Candidates Go Heavy On Insults|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-04-26/news/8601300366_1_faln-puerto-rican-community-puerto-rico|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|accessdate=July 5, 2011|author=Jack Houston|date=April 26, 1986}}</ref> In 1976, while a senior at Northeastern Illinois, he began driving a cab in order to raise enough funds to visit his long-time girlfriend, Soraida, in Puerto Rico. In 1977, after graduating from Northeastern Illinois University with a degree in English, he returned to Puerto Rico and married Soraida. The couple returned to Chicago in 1978, and, unable to find other work, Gutiérrez took up taxi driving full-time.<ref>{{cite news| title=Taking a Taxi to the House of Representatives| url=http://www.rollcall.com/issues/57_2/taking-a-taxi-to-the-house-of-representatives-207041-1.html?zkMobileView=false|date=July 6, 2011|accessdate=July 6, 2011|first=Alexandra|last=Jaffe|work= Roll Call}}</ref> Gutiérrez eventually found work as a [[Chicago Public School]] teacher and later a [[child abuse]] [[Caseworker (social work)|caseworker]] with the Illinois Department of Children & Family Services.<ref name="house.gov">{{cite web|title=Official Biography|url=http://gutierrez.house.gov/about-me/full-biography|publisher=house.gov|accessdate=June 22, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410174926/http://gutierrez.house.gov/about-me/full-biography|archivedate=April 10, 2013|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

==Early political career==

===Campaign for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman===
In 1983, Gutiérrez left his job with the Illinois Department of Children and Family Services to run against incumbent [[Dan Rostenkowski]] for 32nd ward Democratic committeeman in the March 1984 primary election. To fund his campaign, Gutiérrez returned to driving a cab seven days a week, 14 hours a day. Gutiérrez's work as a taxi driver grew his campaign fund to $6,000, against which Rostenkowski had hundreds of thousands of dollars. Reporting on Gutiérrez's early political career, Jorge Casuso and Ben Joravsky of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote: "Gutiérrez thought he could win. [[Harold Washington|Washington]]'s 1983 victory – the first local race Gutiérrez had voted in – had left him wildly optimistic. Before that, he didn't think blacks, Hispanics and poor people could win a legitimate voice in local government."<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

Relying on his family and friends as campaign staff, Gutiérrez opened up his campaign office on North California Ave in Chicago's [[Humboldt Park, Chicago|Humboldt Park neighborhood]]. Gutiérrez collected over three-fourths of the 2,200 signatures he needed to qualify for the ballot on his own. Rostenkowski, then a twelve-term Congressman and Chair of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways & Means Committee]] soundly defeated Gutiérrez, with 76% of the vote.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

===Adviser to Harold Washington===
Following Gutiérrez's loss to Dan Rostenkowski, he helped found the [[Cook County, Illinois|Cook County]] Coalition for New Politics in spring of 1984. The coalition was meant to be a grass-roots, independent, and multiracial counterweight to the [[Cook County Democratic Party]].<ref name="Marable 1998">{{cite book |last= Marable |first=Manning |title=Black leadership |publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] |year=1998 }}</ref>

Gutiérrez's political activism and role as a rising leader in Chicago's burgeoning Latino community caught the attention of Chicago's first African-American Mayor – Harold Washington – who appointed him in August 1984 to the position of deputy superintendent in the [[Law and Government of Chicago|Department of Streets and Sanitation]].<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

Gutiérrez served as a deputy superintendent in the Washington administration and as an administrative assistant to the Mayor – serving on the Mayor's committee on infrastructure.<ref name="Fremon 1988">{{cite book |last=Fremon |first=David |title=Chicago politics, ward by ward |publisher=[[Indiana University Press]] |year=1988 }}</ref>

In October 1984, a [[Molotov cocktail]] came crashing through the front living room window of Gutiérrez's home. For a period of three months following the firebombing, his family lived in hotel rooms. The offenders were never identified, but Gutiérrez attributed the attack to "culprits from the right... opposed to reform and Mayor Washington".<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

In July 1985, in an effort to support Washington's political reform movement, Gutiérrez founded the [[West Town, Chicago|West Town]]-26th Ward Independent Political Organization (IPO). Like the Cook County Coalition for New Politics, the organization aimed to bring together residents of all races in support of progressive reform in Chicago. The Mayor attended the organization's kick-off event, at which 100 names were added to the mailing list and $5,000 was raised.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

===1986 Aldermanic election===
[[File:Luis Gutierrez and Mayor Harold Washington.jpg|thumb|Mayor [[Harold Washington]] was a key backer of Gutierrez's 1986 bid for 26th ward alderman.]]
In December 1985, as a result of a November 1985 ward remap, district court judge [[Charles Ronald Norgle, Sr.|Charles Norgle]] ordered a special election for March 18, 1986, in seven wards, including the 26th.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> The incumbent alderman of the 26th ward, Michael Nardulli, an Italian-American, chose not to seek re-election in the newly drawn majority Latino district. Gutiérrez declared his candidacy for alderman of the 26th ward and soon received the endorsement of Mayor Harold Washington. At the time of the election, opponents to Washington's administration, led by [[Edward Vrdolyak|Ed Vrdolyak]] of the 10th ward, controlled the City Council. This divide within city government was dubbed by the Chicago media as [[Council Wars]]. The 1986 special elections gave Washington the opportunity to take control of the city council. Because the six other special elections were all but decided, control of the council came down to the race in the 26th ward. [[Manuel Torres (Chicago politician)|Manuel Torres]], then a member of the Democratic machine and Cook County Commissioner, also entered the race for 26th ward Alderman. Torres was endorsed by Vrdolyak, former mayor [[Jane Byrne]], future mayor and then State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]], and machine Alderman [[Edward M. Burke|Ed Burke]] and [[Richard Mell|Dick Mell]].<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

Gutiérrez's campaign volunteers were primarily women, "ex-hippies and... community activists-black, white and Hispanic".<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> With the campaign theme: "Church, Family, Community", support from Mayor Harold Washington – who donated $12,000 to Gutiérrez – and the now 250 members of the West Town-26th Ward Independent Political Organization as volunteers, Gutiérrez bested Torres by 22 votes, a margin not large enough to avoid a run-off against Torres.<ref name="Marable 1998"/><ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|author=Gibson, Ray|title=Mayor Helped Fund Candidates| date=April 16, 1986}}</ref>

On the eve of the Gutiérrez-Torres run-off, Spanish language television aired the candidates' final debate. Gutiérrez, who spoke Spanish during the debate, outperformed Torres, who chose to speak entirely in English. Gutiérrez's use of Spanish and his grass-roots organizing are credited for his 53%–47% victory over Torres. Gutiérrez is reported to have said during the election: "My supporters could give a damn about the Democratic Party. They're ready to work on whatever it is that moves socioeconomic justice ahead."<ref name="Marable 1998"/><ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

===Chicago City Council===
Upon entering the [[Chicago City Council]], Gutiérrez, representing the 26th Ward, became Mayor Harold Washington's unofficial floor leader, and leader of the Latinos in the council.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Gutiérrez said of his role as unofficial Washington spokesman: "There are only six or seven of us of the twenty-five [pro-Washington alderman] that say anything. You could say there's only six or seven that have big mouths and want to talk all the time. But I figured it out-there's only six or seven of us that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have anything on, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't done a favor for, that Eddie Vrdolyak hasn't taken care of some problem, that Eddie Vrdolyak doesn't have some dirt on. So, when you want to get up and take Eddie on, you got to be clean."<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

As a member of the city council, Gutiérrez was a key backer of the 1986 gay rights ordinance – which sought to ban discrimination based upon gender & sexual orientation. He was also a proponent of local economic development and construction of affordable housing. He was referred to as a "workhorse in the city council" by political author Marable Manning.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/>

In the 1987 municipal elections, Gutiérrez faced five opponents and was re-elected to the City Council with 66% of the vote.<ref name="Fremon 1988"/> Following Washington's death and the battle over who would succeed the deceased Mayor, Gutiérrez voted for African-American Alderman [[Timothy C. Evans]] over machine-backed Alderman [[Eugene Sawyer]]. In the 1989 Mayoral election, Gutiérrez endorsed State's Attorney [[Richard M. Daley]] for Mayor, stating: "I will have a great influence in determining the thrust and tone of the Daley administration`s progressive and liberal agendas."<ref>{{cite news|publisher=The Chicago Tribune|author=Casuso, Jorge|title=Gutierrez`s Turnabout Has Heads Spinning|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1989-02-13/news/8903040994_1_gutierrez-alderman-timothy-evans|date=February 13, 1989}}</ref>

Under Daley's administration, Gutiérrez served as Chair of the Committee on Housing, Land Acquisition, Disposition, and Leases and Council President [[pro tempore]], presiding over meetings in the Mayor's absence.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;Election (1992)
In 1990, a court order created a new "[[earmuff|earmuff-shaped]]" majority Latino congressional district, with two main sections in Chicago connected by a thin corridor in the suburbs. Four candidates announced their intention to run in the 1992 Democratic primary: Gutiérrez, Alderman [[Richard Mell|Dick Mell]] of the 33rd ward, then Cook County Board of Appeals Commissioner [[Joseph Berrios]], and [[Juan Soliz]], former Alderman of 25th ward.<ref name="Kass, John">{{cite news |author= Kass, John |date=December 10, 1991 |title=Gutierrez Picks Up Daley`s Backing For Congress |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-10/news/9104210061_1_alderman-mayor-richard-daley-hispanic }}</ref> Mell, the only white candidate, entered the race out of his "personal dislike for Gutiérrez".<ref name="Davis, Robert">{{cite news |author= Davis, Robert |date=December 18, 1991 |title=Hispanics Urge Mell To Withdraw, But Soliz Disagrees |work=Chicago Tribune |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-12-18/news/9104230484_1_hispanic-leaders-richard-mell-alderman}}</ref> Gutiérrez received the endorsement of Mayor Richard M.

In his continued efforts to reform immigration, Gutiérrez has participated in two acts of non-violent civil disobedience outside of the White House. The first took place on May 1, 2010, where, following a speech delivered to hundreds at Lafayette Park, Gutiérrez marched with protesters to the White House and refused to leave until Presidential action was taken on immigration reform or he was arrested. Many of the protesters who joined Gutiérrez had signs that called for a Presidential moratorium on deportation and criticized recent anti-immigrant legislation passed in Arizona – [[Arizona SB 1070|SB 1070]]. Gutiérrez also joined the protesters in criticizing Arizona Governor [[Jan Brewer]]'s decision to sign the measure allowing racial profiling in the state-level enforcement of immigration laws.<ref name="news.blogs.cnn.com">{{cite news |url=http://news.blogs.cnn.com/2010/05/01/congressman-arrested-at-immigration-rally/ |title=Congressman arrested at immigration rally |accessdate=May 1, 2010 |publisher=CNN |date=May 1, 2010}}</ref>

On July 26, 2011, in response to a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama, and the President's continued refusal to stop deportations of DREAM Act eligible youth, Gutiérrez and eleven labor, faith, and civil rights leaders were arrested outside the White House. A crowd of 2,500 came to support Gutiérrez and the eleven other leaders. A day before the arrest, President Obama sent a letter to Gutiérrez in which he stated that he would continue his administration's deportation policy.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-luis-gutierrez/why-i-got-arrested-for-pr_b_916130.html |title=Why I Got Arrested for Protesting Obama's Deportation Policy |first=Luis |last=Gutierrez |publisher=Huffington Post |date=August 2, 2011 |accessdate=June 22, 2014}}</ref>

In 2009, and again in 2011, Gutiérrez went on a nationwide tour in support of comprehensive immigration reform and a moratorium on the deportation of families. The tours have received widespread media attention and helped revive the nationwide discussion on immigration reform. Gutiérrez was the main speaker at the historic March 21, 2010, [[March for America]] rally at the capitol mall attended by over 200,000 people.<ref>{{cite web|last=Rivlin |first=Douglas |url=http://www.alternet.org/immigration/146119/200,000_march_for_immigration_reform_in_massive_d.c._rally |title=200,000 March For Immigration Reform in Massive D.C. Rally |publisher=Alternet.org |date= |accessdate=May 31, 2015}}</ref>

Gutiérrez was the first elected official to sponsor a version of the [[DREAM Act]] – legislation to allow undocumented youth brought to the United States as minors a pathway to citizenship – in 2001.<ref name="house.gov"/> In 2009 Gutiérrez introduced CIR-ASAP – Comprehensive Immigration Reform for America's Security and Prosperity Act – a bill to create a pathway to citizenship for non-criminal undocumented immigrants and improve border security. The bill received over 100 co-sponsors and was endorsed by members of the business community and [[organized labor]] unions, including the [[AFL-CIO]], [[United Food and Commercial Workers]], and the [[Service Employees International Union]].<ref>{{cite news| title=CIR ASAP Is the Bill America's Workforce Asked for and Deserves | author=Gutierrez, Luis |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/rep-luis-gutierrez/cir-asap-is-the-bill-amer_b_396228.html | accessdate= July 8, 2011 | work=Huffington Post | date=December 22, 2009}}</ref> He described the bill before a Washington DC rally: {{quote|My bill will promote fair immigration proceedings, humane treatment of immigration detainees, and policies that respect the tenet of community policing. No more raids in our community, no more separation of our families. Now, none of this works without a strong commitment to America’s labor force. None of it works without a strong commitment. So one of the tenets of our bill will be comprehensive immigration reform, has to mean—has to mean—to protecting all workers.|Luis Gutiérrez|<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2009/10/14/headlines

}}</ref>}} Following CIR-ASAP's defeat in the Congress, Gutiérrez has been a main backer of the DREAM Act in the House.<ref name="house.gov"/>

Gutiérrez called former Maryland Governor [[Martin O'Malley]] a "champion" of immigration in 2014 when the two were working to oppose the White House's deportation policy.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Haberman|first1=Maggie|title=ILuis Gutiérrez: Martin O’Malley ‘champion’ of immigration|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2014/09/luis-gutierrez-martin-omalley-immigration-110666.html|accessdate=June 24, 2015|publisher=Politico|date=September 6, 2014}}</ref>

====Veterans' access to health care====
{{BLP self-published|section|date=June 2014}}
While Gutiérrez was a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee, the House passed legislation introduced by Gutiérrez that made treatment and counseling available to [[veterans]] who have been victims of [[Military sexual trauma|sexual trauma]].<ref name="house.gov"/> Gutiérrez also successfully expanded healthcare coverage to those exposed to [[Agent Orange]] and high levels of [[radiation]] during military service.<ref name="house.gov"/>

Gutiérrez's assistance was pivotal in securing $92 million in additional healthcare and [[prosthetic]] funding for veterans.<ref name="house.gov"/>

====Puerto Rico====

Gutiérrez has been an advocate for human and civil rights of the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] people. In the late 1990s and the 2000s, he was a leader in the [[United States Navy in Vieques, Puerto Rico|Vieques movement]], which sought to stop the [[United States military]] from using the inhabited island as a bomb testing ground. In May 2000, Gutiérrez was one of nearly two hundred people arrested (including fellow congresswoman [[Nydia Velázquez]]) for refusing to leave the natural habitat the US military wished to continue using as a bombing range.<ref name="Morales, Ed">{{cite news | url=http://www.thenation.com/article/battle-vieques | publisher=The Nation | title = The Battle of Vieques | author=Morales, Ed | date= May 11, 2000}}</ref> Gutierrez was ultimately successful: in May 2003, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility on Vieques Island was closed; and in May 2004, the U.S. Navy's last remaining base on Puerto Rico, the [[Roosevelt Roads Naval Station]] - which employed 1,000 local contractors and contributed $300 million to the local economy - was closed.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/04/03/national/after-closing-of-navy-base-hard-times-in-puerto-rico.html New York Times: "After Closing of Navy Base, Hard Times in Puerto Rico"]  April 3, 2005</ref><ref>[http://articles.latimes.com/2003/jan/12/nation/na-vieques12 Los Angeles Times: "Navy Makes Plans Without Vieques - Use of bombing ranges in Florida and other U.S. mainland areas will increase after Puerto Rican island training ground is abandoned"] January 12, 2003 ''Admiral [[Robert J. Natter]], commander of the Atlantic Fleet, is on record as saying: "Without Vieques there is no way I need the Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads — none. It's a drain on Defense Department and taxpayer dollars."''</ref>

In 2011, Gutiérrez came out against human rights abuses occurring on the island – specifically [[police brutality]] perpetrated against [[University of Puerto Rico]] students critical of the island's government and a law passed by the [[Luis Fortuño|Fortuño]] government that sought to limit student's [[freedom of speech]]. Gutiérrez also spoke out against a proposed pipeline which would degrade the island's lush tropical habitat and potentially put residents living near the proposed pipeline in danger.<ref>{{cite news | url=http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/massive-puerto-rico-pipeline-triggers-de | publisher=CNS News | title=Massive Puerto Rico pipeline triggers debate | author=Coto, Danica | date=May 14, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110516133634/http://www.cnsnews.com/news/article/massive-puerto-rico-pipeline-triggers-de | archivedate=May 16, 2011 | df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.gutierrez.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=662&Itemid=73 | publisher= Gutierrez Website | title=Shedding Light on Puerto Rico's Gasoducto Project}}</ref>

====Workers' rights====
Gutiérrez is a close ally of organized labor and has voted repeatedly to protect and expand [[labor rights|workers' rights]]. In 2008, Gutiérrez was one of the principal elected officials that assisted workers of the Chicago-based [[Republic Windows and Doors]] during their successful sit-in. The workers had lost their jobs without advance notice, allegedly due to a refusal of credit from Bank of America after the bailout of the financial system. He met with workers and helped them broker a deal with [[Bank of America]].<ref>{{cite web| url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Im7bCPXxWVU | title= Republic Windows Workers Occupy Factory}}</ref> Gutiérrez views his advocacy for workers' rights and immigrant rights as invariably related. He is frequently invited to speak and present before labor unions.<ref>{{cite web | url = http://www.uaw.org/node/2998 | title = Gutierrez: Immigration issues tied to labor issues | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110709005716/http://www.uaw.org/node/2998 | archivedate = July 9, 2011 | df = mdy-all }}</ref>

====North American Free Trade Agreement====
In 1994 Gutiérrez was a vocal opponent of [[North American Free Trade Agreement|NAFTA]] and ultimately voted against the measure because of the legislation's failure to provide for worker retraining, protect against American job loss, and protect Mexican workers' [[collective bargaining]] rights.<ref>{{cite news | title=Gutierrez Resists Party Pressure, Vows He'll Vote Against Nafta | author= Holt, Douglas | publisher= Chicago Tribune | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1993-11-15/news/9311150020_1_anti-nafta-forces-nafta-debate-undecided-house-members| date= November 13, 1993}}</ref><ref>[http://www.chicagomag.com/Chicago-Magazine/Felsenthal-Files/January-2011/Luis-Gutierrez-on-Why-Rahm-Emanuel-Should-Not-Be-Mayor/ "Luis Gutierrez on Why Rahm Emanuel Should Not Be Mayor"] Carol Felsenthal. January 11, 2011</ref>

====Public transportation====
{{BLP self-published|section|date=June 2014}}
When the [[Chicago Transit Authority]] (CTA) declared its plan to close down the [[Douglas Branch]] of the then [[Blue Line (Chicago Transit Authority)|Blue Line]] – which serves primarily working-class Latino communities – Gutiérrez successfully secured $320 million in federal funding to reconstruct Blue Line stops and pressed the CTA to re-instate full service.<ref name="house.gov" /> The Douglas Branch is now known as the [[Pink Line (CTA)]].

====Use of civil disobedience====
With a background as a community activist and organizer, Gutiérrez often uses non-violent [[civil disobedience]] when pushing political causes and legislation. He was arrested in May 2000 in protest of the US military using the inhabited Puerto Rican island of Vieques as a bombing range, and again in May 2010 in protest of presidential inaction on immigration reform.<ref name="news.blogs.cnn.com"/><ref name="Morales, Ed"/> In 2010 and 2011, he was arrested protesting presidential inaction on immigration reform and a record-breaking one-million deportations under President Obama.

====Criticism====
Gutiérrez's progressive political stances are often challenged by political commentators. Since 2008, Gutiérrez has been the subject of several critical stories in the [[Chicago Tribune]] and [[Chicago Sun-Times]], detailing his relationship with former Illinois Governor [[Rod Blagojevich]], and the real estate dealings of Gutierrez and his family.<ref>{{cite news |title=Records: Congressman put daughter up for her state job; CLOUT LIST Gutierrez denies going to Blago as hiring sponsor |first1=Chris |last1=Fusco |first2=Tim |last2=Novak |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226890,CST-NWS-watchside03.article |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100507085359/http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226890,CST-NWS-watchside03.article |archivedate=May 7, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Congressman's daughter's sweet housing deal |first1=Chris |last1=Fusc |first2=Tim |last2=Novak |url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226764,CST-NWS-watchdogs03.article |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=May 3, 2010 |accessdate=May 8, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100506194939/http://www.suntimes.com/news/watchdogs/2226764,CST-NWS-watchdogs03.article |archivedate=May 6, 2010 |df=mdy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |title=Rep.

===Committee assignments===
Upon arriving to the [[United States House of Representatives]], Gutiérrez attempted to organize the 63 incoming Democratic freshmen to support a reform agenda. He sent each one a copy of the book ''Adventures in Porkland: How Washington Wastes Your Money and Why They Won't Stop''. As a result of his attempts to organize the freshmen class, Gutiérrez was passed up by the [[floor leader|House leadership]] for his first choice of the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]], and his second choice of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|Education Committee]]; instead, he was assigned to the [[United States House Committee on Financial Services|Banking Committee]] and [[United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs|Veterans' Affairs]]. In response to being bypassed for his top committee choices as result of his reform advocacy, Gutiérrez charged that then-[[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[Tom Foley]] was "not a reformer in any sense".<ref>{{cite news |title= Congress Lacks Any Appetite For Reform, Gutierrez Charges |author= Kass, John |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1992-12-11/news/9204220888_1_alderman-reform-congress |newspaper= Chicago Tribune |date= December 11, 1992 |accessdate=July 7, 2011}}</ref>

Congressman Gutiérrez sits on the following House Committees:
*'''[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Judiciary Committee]]'''
**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security|Subcommittee on Immigration Policy and Border Security]],
**[[United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations|Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security and Investigations]];

Gutiérrez was a member of the Judiciary Committee during the [[110th United States Congress|110th]] and [[111th United States Congress|111th]] Congress,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://maplight.org/us-congress/legislator/269-luis-gutirrez |title=Luis Gutiérrez Democrat (Elected 1992), IL House district 4|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> serving on the Immigration, Citizenship, Refugees, Border Security, and International Law Subcommittee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/arena/bio/rep_luis_gutierrez.html |title=Arena Profile: Rep. Luis Gutierrez|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref> During that same period of time, he was the Chair of the Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Credit of the Financial Services Committee.<ref name="house.gov"/>

Gutiérrez  is a member of the [[House Baltic Caucus]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Members|author=|url=http://housebalticcaucus.webs.com/members|format=|publisher=House Baltic Caucus|date=|accessdate=21 February 2018}}</ref> the [[Congressional Arts Caucus]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|author=|url=https://artscaucus-slaughter.house.gov/membership|format=|publisher=Congressional Arts Caucus|date=|accessdate=21 March 2018}}</ref> and the [[United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Our Members|author=|url=https://royce.house.gov/internationalconservation/members.html|format=|publisher=U.S. House of Representatives International Conservation Caucus |date=|accessdate=2 August 2018}}</ref>

==Mayoral candidacy speculation==
Gutiérrez' name has often been mentioned as a potential candidate for [[Mayor of Chicago]]. In 2006, he explored running for mayor of Chicago against incumbent [[Richard M. Daley]], but announced in November that he would remain in Congress.

After Daley declared his retirement in 2011, Gutiérrez' name was once again floated as a potential mayoral candidate. In an effort to draft the Congressman into the race, students formed chapters of "Students for Luis Gutiérrez" at six colleges and two Chicago public high schools; but in October, Gutiérrez removed his name from consideration, stating, "I have an obligation not to give up on the fight I've already begun. I have unfinished business to complete", in reference to his work on immigration reform in the United States Congress.<ref>{{cite web | url=http://www.studentsforgutierrez.org/about | publisher=Students for Luis Gutierrez | title=About Us | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120326191945/http://www.studentsforgutierrez.org/about | archivedate=March 26, 2012 | df=mdy-all }}</ref>

==Personal life==
Gutiérrez has been married to Soraida Arocho Gutiérrez for over thirty years. Together, they have two daughters – Omaira and Jessica. Jessica's middle name – Washington – comes from the late Mayor [[Harold Washington]], a close friend and mentor of Gutiérrez.<ref name="articles.chicagotribune.com"/> Soraida battled and survived cancer in the 2000s.<ref>{{cite news |last=Robinson |first=Kevin |title=Gutierrez to Run Again, Everybody Loves Him |url=http://chicagoist.com/2007/08/17/gutierrez_to_ru.php |publisher=Chicagoist |accessdate=July 6, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820002053/http://chicagoist.com/2007/08/17/gutierrez_to_ru.php |archivedate=August 20, 2007 |df=mdy-all }}</ref>
