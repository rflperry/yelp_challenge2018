'''William McClellan''' "'''Mac'''" '''Thornberry''' (born July 15, 1958) is the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] from the [[Texas Panhandle]]. He has served since 1995, when the House seated its first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] majority in 40 years,<ref name="nationaljournal.com">{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/494#biography|title=Mac Thornberry|website=www.nationaljournal.com|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref> and signed the "Contract with America" authored by then Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/big-country/reflecting-on-previous-work-with-presidential-on |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924090225/http://www.reporternews.com/news/big-country/reflecting-on-previous-work-with-presidential-on |archivedate=2015-09-24}}</ref>

A Republican, Thornberry represents {{ushr|TX|13}}, the most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] district in the entire United States, according to CookPVI. The district stretches between the [[Oklahoma]] and [[New Mexico]] borders.

==Early life, education and career==

In the 1880s, Thornberry's great-great-grandfather Amos Thornberry, a [[Union Army]] veteran, moved to [[Clay County, Texas|Clay County]], just east of Wichita Falls.<ref name="nationaljournal.com"/>

Thornberry is a lifelong resident of [[Clarendon, Texas|Clarendon]], 60 miles (97&nbsp;km) east of Amarillo in the heart of the 13th. His family has operated a [[ranch]] in the area since 1881. He received his [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[history]] from [[Texas Tech University]] in [[Lubbock, Texas|Lubbock]]. He then obtained his [[Juris Doctor]] from the [[University of Texas School of Law]] in [[Austin, Texas|Austin]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=T000238|title=THORNBERRY, William McClellan (Mac) - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>

He served as a staffer to two other Texas Republican congressmen, [[Tom Loeffler]] and [[Larry Combest]], and as deputy assistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs under [[Ronald Reagan]] before joining his brothers on the family ranch. Thornberry has called President Reagan "...a great man and a great president, ranking in the top tier of all of our chief executives."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://amarillo.com/stories/2004/06/10/new_onhousefloor.shtml#.VdyLgPlVhBc|title=Thornberry honors Reagan on House floor - Amarillo.com - Amarillo Globe-News|first=GREG|last=CUNNINGHAMgreg.cunningham@amarillo.com|website=amarillo.com|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref> He also practiced law in Amarillo.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=t000238|title=THORNBERRY, William McClellan (Mac) - Biographical Information|website=bioguide.congress.gov|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesrecordnews.com/story/news/local/2017/01/16/thornberry-talks-issues-agenda-editorial-board/96637818/|title=Thornberry talks issues, agenda with editorial board|work=Wichita Falls|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}</ref>

==Tenure and political positions==
According to the ''[[National Journal]]'' Congressional Almanac, "In the House, Thornberry has compiled a solidly conservative voting record, though he has a pragmatic streak and is hardly the most ideological Republican in the Texas delegation. In keeping with his scholarly nature, his official website includes an essay explaining his philosophy and explaining his interest 'in continuing to push government to work smarter and more efficiently.'"<ref>[http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/member/494#biography]</ref>

From January 1995 to July 2017, Thornberry missed 140 of 15,276 roll call votes, or 0.9%, fewer than the median of 2.2% among the lifetime records of representatives currently serving.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/mac_thornberry/400404|title=Mac Thornberry, Representative for Texas's 13th Congressional District|website=GovTrack.us}}</ref>

===Foreign policy===
Thornberry was critical of President Obama's 2010 arms control deal with Russia for precluding the use of nuclear weapons against non-nuclear nations. But he has been more pragmatic than other defense hawks. He served on a bipartisan commission in 2007 that drew up recommendations for winning the war in Iraq with both lethal and non-lethal approaches, such as diplomacy and foreign aid.<ref name="nationaljournal.com" />

===Taxation===
On domestic issues, Thornberry has pressed for repeal of the estate tax and for tax credits to encourage production of oil in marginal wells.<ref name="nationaljournal.com"/>

===Other===
In 2010 Thornberry sponsored a bill to expand access to state veterans' homes to parents whose children died while serving in the military. That bill became law. In January 2011 he introduced a bill to help states set up special health care courts staffed by judges with expertise in the subject. The judges would serve as an alternative to juries that Republicans say are inclined to award unnecessarily large damage amounts in malpractice cases.<ref name="nationaljournal.com"/>

===Term limits===
Thornberry has consistently voted for term limits for U.S. Representatives, but does not intend to term-limit himself until a constitutional amendment is passed that imposes term limits on all members of Congress.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/news/local-news/2011-01-30/mac-has-voted-limits-over-course-9-terms|title=Mac has voted for limits over course of 9 terms|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>

===Agriculture and farm bill===
Thornberry has pressed the house to pass a [[farm bill]] every five years in order to give farmers and ranchers more stability.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/opinion/editorial/2013-07-06/farm-bill-brings-crop-problems|title=Editorial: Farm bill brings crop of problems|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref> In 2013 he voted for the five-year Farm Bill,<ref name="lubbockonline.com">{{cite web|url=http://m.lubbockonline.com/agriculture/2013-06-20/house-rejects-farm-bill-62-republicans-vote-no-area-leaders-vote-yes|title=House rejects farm bill as 62 Republicans vote no, area leaders vote yes|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref> which included annual cuts of $2 billion from food stamps, which would have been the largest change to food policy since 1996. The House did not pass the bill.<ref name="lubbockonline.com"/>

===Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012===
In 2012 Thornberry introduced the [[National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2013#Smith-Mundt Modernization Act of 2012|Smith-Mundt Modernation Act of 2012]] to amend the 1948 Smith-Mundt Act prohibiting the domestic dissemination of propaganda produced for foreign audiences.

===Energy and climate change===
In 2013 Thornberry introduced H.R. 2081, legislation to encourage production of all forms of domestic energy, including oil and gas, nuclear, and alternative energy and fuels.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thornberry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=335181|title=Thornberry says, 'no more excuses' when it comes to domestic energy|date=23 May 2013|website=Congressman Mac Thornberry|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>

Thornberry has voted to open the [[Outer Continental Shelf]] to oil drilling. He has voted to bar the EPA from regulating [[greenhouse gases]]. He has voted against tax credits for renewable electricity.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ontheissues.org/TX/Mac_Thornberry_Energy_+_Oil.htm|title=Mac Thornberry on Energy & Oil|website=www.ontheissues.org|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>

In July 2015, the President signed highway funding extension legislation into law.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2015/07/31/president-signs-extension-highway-funding-bill |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150814094811/https://www.whitehouse.gov/photos-and-video/video/2015/07/31/president-signs-extension-highway-funding-bill |archivedate=2015-08-14 |df= }}</ref> It included a provision based on a liquefied natural gas (LNG) excise tax bill, H.R. 905, that Thornberry introduced with Rep. John Larson (D-CT).<ref>[http://www.myhighplains.com/story/d/story/president-signs-thornberrys-natural-gas-provision/25324/hRY55svp6Equ1Jm6Y3bEZA ]{{dead link|date=June 2017}}</ref> The federal excise tax on LNG and diesel has been set at 24.3 cents per gallon. Because it takes 1.7 gallons of LNG to produce the same amount of energy as a gallon of diesel fuel, LNG is being taxed 70 percent higher than diesel. The new law "levels the playing field" by applying the excise tax to LNG and diesel based on the amount of energy each produces, which is how it is applied to Compressed Natural Gas and gasoline.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.theautochannel.com/news/2015/08/05/138245-cng-vs-diesel-now-fair-fight.html|title=CNG Vs.

===Cybersecurity===
In 2011, House Speaker John Boehner selected Thornberry to lead an initiative on cybersecurity to combat the growing national security and economic threat.<ref name="house.gov">{{cite web|url=http://thornberry.house.gov/issues/issue/?IssueID=44735#sthash.PHVgfk4Q.dpuf|title=Congressman Mac Thornberry|website=thornberry.house.gov|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref> The task force was composed of representatives from nine committees with jurisdiction over cyber issues. The panel recommended reforming a range of current laws, including the 2002 Federal Information Security Management Act, which governs government security programs.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/house-republicans-propose-cybersecurity-incentives-over-regulation-20111005 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024122413/http://www.nationaljournal.com/tech/house-republicans-propose-cybersecurity-incentives-over-regulation-20111005 |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}</ref>

In a 2012 column for Federal News Radio, Thornberry wrote, "If we can get an information sharing bill to the President, however, Congress should not consider their work done. We still have larger issues to grapple with, such as the role of the Department of Homeland Security and whether some industries will require a regulatory nudge to improve their network standards."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://federalnewsradio.com/congress/2012/10/column-cyber-inaction-may-be-our-achilles-heel/|title=Column: Cyber inaction may be our Achilles' heel|date=24 October 2012|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref> That year, the House passed comprehensive cybersecurity legislation, but the Senate failed to act on any of it.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/08/02/politics/cybersecurity-act/index.html|title=Cybersecurity bill fails in Senate - CNNPolitics.com|first=By Jennifer Rizzo|last=CNN|website=CNN|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>

===Drugs===
In 2015, Thornberry introduced H.R. 1186, the Synthetic Abuse and Labeling Toxic Substances (SALTS) Act, which would make it easier for law enforcement officials to take action against synthetic drug manufacturers, distributors, and sellers by closing a loophole that makes it difficult to prosecute them if they label packages as "not intended for human consumption."<ref>{{cite web|url=https://thornberry.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=397992|title=Thornberry aims to crack down on synthetic drugs|date=5 August 2015|website=Congressman Mac Thornberry|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>

===Interest group ratings===

==Political campaigns==
Thornberry defeated [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] Congressman [[Bill Sarpalius]] in the 1994 [[general election]], a heavily Republican year nationwide. He polled 79,416 votes (55 percent) to Sarpalius's 63,923 votes (44 percent). Two years earlier in a much higher-turnout election, Sarpalius received nearly double the votes that he did in 1994. The 13th has always been a somewhat conservative district, but on paper had been made somewhat less Republican in the 1990s redistricting. For this reason, Thornberry's victory was regarded as an upset.

Thornberry has never faced another contest nearly as close as his initial one, and has been reelected 10 times, never with less than 67 percent of the vote. While voters in this region began splitting their tickets as early as the 1940s, Democrats continued to hold most local offices well into the 1990s. Thornberry's win began a wave of Republican victories in this region, and it is now reckoned as one of the most Republican districts in the nation. In 2013 the [[Cook Partisan Voting Index]] rated it the most Republican district in the country (R+32).<ref>[http://cookpolitical.com/story/5604/ The Median & Most Partisan Districts, 1998-2014] ''The Cook Political Report''. October 9, 2013.</ref>

Thornberry is only the third Republican to represent the district for a full term since [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]]. The previous Republican representatives were [[Robert "Bob" Price|Robert D. "Bob" Price]] of [[Pampa, Texas|Pampa]] (1967–75) and [[Beau Boulter]] of Amarillo (1985–89).

In the 2006 and 2008 elections, Thornberry handily defeated former [[intelligence officer]] and professor Roger Waun.

In the 2012 Republican primary, Thornberry overwhelmed his lone opponent, Pamela Lee Barlow, 47,251 votes (78 percent) to 13,643 (22 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm |title=Republican primary election returns, May 29, 2012 |publisher=enr.sos.state.tx.us |accessdate=May 30, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20120610141810/http://enr.sos.state.tx.us/enr/results/may29_160_state.htm |archivedate=June 10, 2012 |df= }}</ref> In the general election, Thornberry bested (91 percent) Libertarian John Robert Deek of Denton and Green Party candidate Keith F. Houston of [[Canyon, Texas|Canyon]] (there was no Democratic candidate).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.reporternews.com/news/2012/nov/06/big-country-reps-will-keep-their-jobs/?print=1|title=Big Country reps will keep their jobs, November 6, 2012|publisher=http://www.reporternews.com|accessdate=February 26, 2013}}</ref>

In the 2014 Republican primary, Thornberry easily won re-nomination, with 45,097 votes (68 percent) to challengers Pamela Barlow's 12,438 (19 percent) and Elaine Hays's 8,860 (13 percent).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://amarillo.com/news/2014-03-04/primary-2014-thornberry-fends-challengers-house-seat|title=Thornberry fends off challengers for House seat|publisher=|accessdate=23 June 2017}}</ref>
