===Elections===
;1996
Holt first ran for Congress in 1996 in [[New Jersey's 12th congressional district]] after incumbent Republican congressman [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] decided to run for the U.S. Senate. On June 4, 1996, Holt lost the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic party]] [[primary election|primary]], receiving 24% of the vote and finishing last of the three candidates.

Holt challenged one-term Congressman Michael Pappas. The incumbent's campaign experienced a setback after he read a poem, set to the tune of "[[Twinkle Twinkle Little Star]]", praising [[Kenneth Starr]] on the floor of the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]]. Holt defeated Pappas by 4 percentage points, 51% to 47%, becoming the first Democrat to represent the district in two decades.

;2000
Holt was challenged by former Republican Congressman [[Dick Zimmer (New Jersey politician)|Dick Zimmer]] in the [[United States House elections, 2000|2000 election]]. Holt's prior win was thought by Republicans to be a fluke, and the race attracted considerable money and advertising. The election was hotly contested and the winner was not known on election day. Zimmer was ahead on election night by just a few votes, but Holt was ahead the next day. Ten days after the election, Holt declared himself the winner by 481 votes. Zimmer challenged the results, but conceded after the count began to go against him.<ref>[http://transcripts.cnn.com/2000/ALLPOLITICS/stories/11/29/nj.house.ap/index.html CNN.com — Zimmer concedes congressional race in N.J. after 22 days], November 29, 2000</ref><ref>[http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/09/25/page3/ ''The Daily Princetonian'' — Page 3] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20021003071811/http://www.dailyprincetonian.com/archives/2002/09/25/page3/ |date=2002-10-03 }}, September 25, 2002</ref> Holt ultimately won the election by a margin of 651 votes: 146,162 votes for Holt (48.730%) compared to Zimmer's 145,511 (48.513%), making it the only general election where Holt has not received a majority of the votes in the election. Holt won Mercer (61%) and Middlesex (56%) while losing Monmouth (48%), Hunterdon (35%), and Somerset (37%).

;2002
[[Redistricting]] after the 2000 census Holt's district became much safer politically, in part by adding much of [[Trenton, New Jersey|Trenton]] while cutting out more conservative-leaning territory in Somerset and Hunterdon counties. While Holt faced a fairly well-funded challenge from Republican [[Secretary of State of New Jersey]] [[DeForest Soaries|Buster Soaries]], Holt easily won a third term, taking 61% to Soaries' 38%.

After redistricting in 2011, the 12th District became considerably more Democratic. All of the Republican-leaning portions of [[Hunterdon County]] and [[Monmouth County, New Jersey|Monmouth County]] were taken out of the 12th district while the Democratic-leaning towns of [[Plainfield, New Jersey|Plainfield]], [[Scotch Plains, New Jersey|Scotch Plains]], [[Fanwood, New Jersey|Fanwood]], [[Middlesex, New Jersey|Middlesex]], [[Dunellen, New Jersey|Dunellen]], [[Bound Brook, New Jersey|Bound Brook]], [[South Bound Brook, New Jersey|South Bound Brook]], [[Manville, New Jersey|Manville]], [[East Windsor Township, New Jersey|East Windsor Township]], and [[Hightstown, New Jersey|Hightstown]] were added to the 12th district.

As a Congressman, Holt maintained liberal viewpoints on several major issues, and consistently voted accordingly. For example, he supported abortion rights, opposed the privatization of Social Security, and supported a public health care option. Several of his legislative priorities included tax credits for small businesses, increasing access to a college education for middle-class families, maintaining Medicare and Social Security, and preserving the environment.

;Environment
As a member of the [[House Committee on Natural Resources]], Holt supported legislation to clean up the environment and cap greenhouse gas emissions, and he promoted the development and use of alternative energy sources. He reintroduced the Big Oil Bailout Prevention Act in 2011, co-sponsored the No New Drilling Act in 2012 to prevent new oil drilling on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]], co-sponsored the Oceans Conservation, Education, and National Strategy for the 21st Century Act (H.R. 21), founded the Children's Environmental Health Caucus to raise awareness about environmental issues pertaining to children's health, and secured funding to preserve open space and recreation areas.<ref>{{cite web|title=Bill Summary and Status for H.R.21|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d110:H.R. 21:|publisher=The Library of Congress|accessdate=20 November 2012}}</ref><ref name="Children’s Environmental Health Caucus">{{cite web|title=Legislative Tracking System|url=http://www.ciclt.net/sn/pol/poc_detail.aspx?P_ID=&ClientCode=masc&LegComID=19985|publisher=Municipal Association of South Carolina|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

On June 26, 2009, Holt voted for the Energy and Environmental Law Amendments ("Cap and Trade") Bill (H.R. 2454), which passed in the House by a narrow margin of 219 to 212. He also voted for the Renewable Energy Credits and Other Business and Individual Credits Bill (H.R. 7060) to extend energy efficiency tax credits, as well as various individual and business tax credits.<ref name="Key Votes">{{cite web|title=Key Votes|url=http://votesmart.org/candidate/key-votes/22574/rush-holt-jr#.UKvMA-Oe9ro|publisher=Vote Smart|accessdate=16 November 2012}}</ref>

Holt maintained a 100 percent lifetime rating from the [[League of Conservation Voters]] since 1999, in addition to a 100 percent rating by [[Environment America]] in 2008, 2009, and 2011, and a 100 percent rating by [[Defenders of Wildlife]] Action Fund from 2003 to 2008. On November 12, 2012, the New Jersey [[Sierra Club]] awarded Holt the Outstanding Achievement Award for his environmental conservation efforts.<ref>{{cite web|title=Sierra Club Celebrates Enviro Leaders and Volunteers|url=http://newjersey.sierraclub.org/PressReleases/0410.asp|publisher=Sierra Club: New Jersey Chapter|accessdate=18 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130127020415/http://newjersey.sierraclub.org/PressReleases/0410.asp|archivedate=27 January 2013|df=}}</ref>

A September 2012 ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' article featured Holt and his rare background as a research scientist: "[Holt] thinks what is equally important is having more scientific thinking, even among the non-scientists in government...[Holt states], 'I'm more interested in the way that scientists are trained to deal with uncertainty, to deal with evidence and statistical reasoning, things that are lacking in the political debate.' When it comes to global warming, for instance, Representative Holt says we don't need people in Congress who understand atmospheric pressure, or glaciation. We simply need them to be open to the idea that evidence might disprove what they think they know. And that, he says, is thinking like a scientist."<ref name="Thinking Like a Scientist: Solution to Politics?">{{cite web|last=Holt|first=Rush|title=Thinking Like a Scientist: Solution to Politics?|url=http://www.rushholt.com/content/thinking-scientist-solution-politics|publisher=Congressman Rush Holt|accessdate=19 November 2012}}</ref>

Discussing science’s role in policy and government, Holt points out a [[fallacy]] in the way people think about science: "The ethic in the profession is that you stick to your science, and if you’re interested in how science affects public policy or public questions, just let the facts speak for themselves. Of course, there’s a fallacy there, too. Facts are, by themselves, voiceless."<ref name="Distillations">{{cite journal|last1=Roberts |first1=Jacob  |title=Political Scientist |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=1 |pages=30–33 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/political-scientist|accessdate=March 20, 2018}}</ref>

;Education

Holt is a strong supporter of educational initiatives, but questions the ways in which science is taught. "Our real problem is not that we’re failing to produce excellent scientists, because we are [producing them], but rather that we have failed to maintain an appreciation for and understanding of science in the general population."<ref name="Kramer"/> He is concerned that science education since 1958 may have created a population that is largely disconnected from scientific thinking. "We left behind about 80% of the population because we teach science in the schools primarily for future scientists."<ref name="Distillations"/> Holt emphasizes the importance to all citizens of empirically-based thinking:

{{quote|"The genius of science is that it will make ordinary people capable of making very smart decisions. We’ve lost that idea... a lot of ordinary Americans feel they not only can’t comprehend evidence but that it has little relevance for them and has no place in their lives. Climate change comes along and instead of asking, “What’s the evidence,” they say, “I don’t believe in it.”<ref name="Distillations"/>}}

While co-chair of the Research and Development Caucus, a member of the [[United States House Committee on Education and the Workforce|House Committee on Education and Labor]], and serving on the [[National Commission on Mathematics and Science Teaching for the 21st Century]], Holt worked on crafting several comprehensive education policies. He helped write the [[College Cost Reduction Act]] - the largest college aid expansion bill since the [[GI bill]] - which drastically reduced student loan interest rates and included Holt's provision to provide upfront tuition assistance for math, science, and foreign language teachers.<ref>{{cite web|last=Holt|first=Rush|title=Biography|url=http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=5|publisher=Representative Rush Holt|accessdate=18 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110100417/http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=14&Itemid=5|archivedate=10 November 2012|df=}}</ref>  He also helped establish the "American Opportunity" tax credit to alleviate the burden of college tuition for low- and moderate-income students. Furthermore, Holt helped enact the [[Education Jobs and Medicaid Assistance Act]], which provides states with funding to reduce budget shortfalls and keep teachers in their classrooms.<ref>{{cite web|title=156 Cong. Rec. H6604 - EDUCATION JOBS AND MEDICAID ASSISTANCE ACT|url=https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/granule/CREC-2010-08-10/CREC-2010-08-10-pt1-PgH6604-3/content-detail.html|website=U.S. Government Publishing Office|accessdate=10 April 2018}}</ref>

For his significant legislative work on and support for all education initiatives, but also for legislation to strengthen national security through expansion and improvement of foreign language study, and to increase foreign language capacity in the U.S. intelligence community and throughout the federal government by expanding education in critical need foreign languages, Holt received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in 2005.<ref>{{cite web|title=The James W. Dodge Foreign Language Advocate Award |url=http://www.nectfl.org/awards-james-w-dodge-foreign-language-advocate-award |publisher=Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages |accessdate=August 28, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140821193635/http://www.nectfl.org/awards-james-w-dodge-foreign-language-advocate-award |archivedate=August 21, 2014 |df= }}</ref>

On May 28, 2010, Holt voted in support of the Science and Technology Funding Bill (H.R. 5116), a bill passed in the House that provided funding for science and technology research and development purposes.<ref name="Key Votes"/>

Formerly the Assistant Director at [[Princeton University]]'s [[Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory]],<ref name="Kramer">{{cite journal|last1=Kramer|first1=David|title=From Congress to AAAS, Rush Holt reflects on science policy|journal=Physics Today|date=March 2015|volume=68|issue=3|pages=22–24|doi=10.1063/PT.3.2714|bibcode=2015PhT....68c..22K}}</ref> Holt sought to promote involvement in programs of [[STEM fields]]. He successfully defended funding for the Department of Education’s Mathematics and Science Partnerships programs. As a result of his efforts, he was repeatedly given an "A" rating by the [[National Education Association]] after 2007, along with a 100 percent approval rating by the [[National Association for College Admission Counseling]] in 2006 and 2009-2011.

On January 22, 2013, Holt introduced a [[United States Congress#Bills and resolutions|resolution]] designating February 12, 2013 ([[Charles Darwin]]'s 204th birthday), as "[[Darwin Day]]" in order to recognize "the importance of [[sciences]] in the betterment of [[human]]ity".<ref name="NYT-20130201">{{cite news |last=Oppenheimer |first=Mark|title=Seeing Darwin Through Christian Eyes?

;Social issues
On his website, Holt stated, "Since coming to Congress, I have fought for fairness in health care coverage, worked to protect victims of domestic violence and sexual assault, supported equal pay for equal work, and sought gender equity in schools."<ref name="Issues - Women's Issues">{{cite web|last=Holt|first=Rush|title=Issues - Women's Issues|url=http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37&Itemid=29|accessdate=17 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121211214158/http://holt.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=37&Itemid=29|archivedate=11 December 2012|df=}}</ref> While a Congressman, he strongly believed in women's right to make decisions about their health care, without interference by the government, and supported [[Roe v. Wade]].

Holt successfully opposed legislation that would have prevented access to birth control, eliminated funding for [[Title X]] (the national family planning program), and denied federal funding to [[Planned Parenthood]]. Planned Parenthood and the [[National Family Planning & Reproductive Health Association]] consistently issued an approval rating of 100 percent for Holt beginning in 1995, while the [[NARAL Pro-Choice America]] rated Holt 100 percent beginning in 1999.

Holt also sponsored the Helping Seniors Choose their Medicare Drug Plan Act (H.R. 3152), which increased the access that low-income healthcare recipients have to prescription drugs under Medicare and Medicaid. With the Protection Against Wrongful Voter Purges Act (H.R. 3835), Holt attempted to regulate the removal of voters' names from eligibility lists to ensure the validity of those lists. With the Judicious Use of Surveillance Tools in Counterterrorism Efforts (JUSTICE) Act of 2009 (H.R. 4005), Holt increased limits on governmental power with respect to counterterrorism efforts.<ref name="Rush Holt">{{cite web
