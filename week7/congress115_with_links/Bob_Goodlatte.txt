'''Robert William Goodlatte''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɡ|ʊ|d|ˌ|l|æ|t}}; born September 22, 1952) is an American politician and attorney. He is currently the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|Chair of the House Judiciary Committee]], which has jurisdiction over legislation affecting the [[United States federal courts|federal courts]], administrative agencies, and [[Federal law enforcement in the United States|federal law enforcement entities]].

In 2017, Goodlatte presided over a [[GOP]] effort, conducted in a secret session, to weaken the independent [[Office of Congressional Ethics]], a move widely criticized by House leaders and the opposition party. The proposal passed by a 119 to 74 vote, but it was withdrawn the following day after widespread public criticism.<ref name="twsBBC1">{{cite web |author=Reuters|date=January 3, 2017|publisher=BBC News |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-38494455|title=US Congress: Republicans vote to limit ethics body|accessdate=January 3, 2017|quote=...in an amendment to House rules by Congressman Bob Goodlatte, would weaken the body's oversight of matters such as conflicts of interests and financial impropriety .... the new body would no longer be able to receive anonymous tip-offs, nor have a spokesperson, and would be under the supervision of the House Ethics Committee.

[[File:George W. Bush and Bob Goodlatte.jpg|thumb|right|Goodlatte with [[President of the United States|President]] [[George W. Bush]] in 2006]]
Bob Goodlatte received the Republican nomination at the Republican District convention after [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]] candidate [[Jim Olin]] opted not to run for reelection in 1992. In the 1992 November general election, Goodlatte defeated Democratic candidate Stephen Musselwhite, who had defeated Olin's preferred choice at the district Democratic convention, with 60% of the vote. Goodlatte has been reelected ten times, often running unopposed. His most substantive Democratic opposition was in 1996, when he faced Jeff Grey, and again in 1998, when [[Roanoke, Virginia|Roanoke]] mayor [[David A. Bowers|David Bowers]] challenged him. In an overwhelmingly conservative district, Goodlatte turned back these challenges, with 67% and 69% of the vote, respectively. In 2008, he was challenged by Democratic candidate [[Sam Rasoul]] of Roanoke. Goodlatte garnered 62% of the vote.  In 2010, Goodlatte was challenged by Independent Jeffrey Vanke and Libertarian Stuart Bain. Goodlatte won with 76.26% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/member_info/electioninfo/index.aspx |title=Office of the Clerk of the U.S. House of Representatives |publisher=Clerk.house.gov |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref>

===Policy views===
[[File:Bob Goodlatte (16664067356).jpg|thumb|Goodlatte speaking at the 2015 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] ]]

====Office of Congressional Ethics====
During a secret meeting on the night before the start of the [[115th United States Congress|115th Congress]], Goodlatte led an attempt by House Republicans to reduce the reach of the independent [[Office of Congressional Ethics]]. The Office was created in 2008 after numerous infractions involving Republican lobbyist [[Jack Abramoff]], resulting in the imprisonment of House member [[Bob Ney]].<ref name="twsNYT4849">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/02/us/politics/with-no-warning-house-republicans-vote-to-hobble-independent-ethics-office.html?_r=0|title=With No Warning, House Republicans Vote to Gut Independent Ethics Office|date=January 3, 2017|publisher=The New York Times|quote=...Goodlatte announced on Monday that the House Republican Conference had approved a change to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics...|author=Eric Lipton|accessdate=January 3, 2017}}</ref> The proposed amendment to House Rules, spearheaded by Goodlatte, gave the [[House Ethics Committee]] - made up of partisan elected officials - oversight of what would be the renamed Office and power to stop inquiries that had the potential to lead to criminal charges. It would have also blocked the Office's staff from speaking with reporters and other news media members.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/article/2017/jan/03/house-gops-ethics-vote-what-was-all-about-anyway/|title=The House GOP's ethics vote: What was that about, anyway?|last=Jacobson|first=Louis|date=2017-01-03|work=|newspaper=PolitiFact|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}</ref>

The amendment passed during the secret meeting, but its fortunes were reversed once news of the measure leaked out. The proposed changes immediately drew strong criticism from prominent figures on both sides of the aisle, including House Minority Leader [[Nancy Pelosi]], President-elect [[Donald Trump]], and even Abramoff himself.<ref name=":0" /><ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/house-ethics-panel-jack-abramoff-233126|title=Jack Abramoff slams GOP over House ethics changes|last=Goldmacher|first=Shane|date=2016-01-03|work=|newspaper=Politico|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}</ref> Additionally, social media catalyzed a swift reaction from constituents, with [[Google]] reporting that searches for "Who is my representative" surged in the hours following the public unveiling of the mooted changes to the Office.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/312547-google-reports-jump-in-who-is-my-representative-search-after|title=Google searches for 'who is my representative' spike|last=Calfas|first=Jennifer|date=2017-01-03|work=|newspaper=The Hill|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}</ref> Representatives received thousands of calls demanding they cease their support for the amendment.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/republicans-house-ethics-backlash-233152|title=Inside the House GOP ethics debacle|last=Bade|first=Rachael|date=2017-01-03|work=|last2=Bresnahan|first2=John|newspaper=Politico|last3=Cheney|first3=Kyle|access-date=2017-01-04|via=}}</ref> In less than 24 hours, Goodlatte and his fellow Republicans scrapped the proposal.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/03/us/politics/trump-house-ethics-office.html|title=House Republicans, Under Fire, Back Down on Gutting Ethics Office|last=Lipton|first=Eric|date=2017-01-03|last2=Flegenheimer|first2=Matt|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-04}}</ref>

=== Undocumented immigrant gang members ===

Goodlatte recently co introduced the [[Criminal Alien Gang Member Removal Act]] (with fellow politicians [[Barbara Comstock]], [[Peter T King|Peter King]] and Raul Labrador).<ref>{{cite web |title=Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Combat Gang Violence and Enhance Public Safety |url=https://goodlatte.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=967 |website=House.Gov |publisher=House.Gov |accessdate=12 August 2018}}</ref>

====Budget====
One of Goodlatte's legislative initiatives was his constitutional amendment to require a balanced [[United States federal budget|federal budget]]. Goodlatte wrote and put forward both the "clean" [[Balanced Budget Amendment]] which had a higher chance of actually passing the House and the Senate as well as a version that makes it harder to increase taxes by requiring a two-thirds majority vote in both chambers to raise taxes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.atr.org/conservatives-congress-vote-weak-balanced-budget-a6580|title=Conservatives to Congress: Vote NO on a Weak Balanced Budget Amendment|author=Mattie Duppler|date=2011-11-09|accessdate=2012-06-03|publisher=Americans for Tax Reform}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/on-the-money/budget/192699-gop-favors-clean-balanced-budget-amendment-sponsor-says |title=Sponsor says 'clean' balanced budget amendment has edge for floor vote |publisher=TheHill |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}</ref> However, Representatives [[Paul Ryan]], [[Justin Amash]], [[David Dreier]] and [[Louie Gohmert]] voted against the "clean" amendment because it could have allowed taxes to be raised on Americans. Ryan released a statement after the vote, saying: "I'm concerned that this version will lead to a much bigger government fueled by more taxes. Spending is the problem, yet this version of the Balanced Budget Amendment makes it more likely taxes will be raised, government will grow, and economic freedom will be diminished. Without a limit on government spending, I cannot support this Amendment."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://campaign2012.washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/why-ryan-voted-against-balanced-budget-amendment|title=Washington Examiner|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}</ref>

====National security====

Goodlatte supported President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven [[Muslim-majority countries]]. He stated that "The primary duty of the federal government is to keep Americans safe. Today, President Trump has begun to fulfill this responsibility by taking a number of critical steps within his authority to strengthen national security and the integrity of our nation's immigration system."<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Coffman, Gardner join Republicans against President Trump's travel ban; here's where the rest stand|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/29/republicans-on-trump-travel-ban/|website=Denver Post|accessdate=30 January 2017}}</ref>

====Technology====
Goodlatte is the co-chairman of the bipartisan Congressional Internet Caucus, Chairman of the House Republican High-Technology Working Group, and Co-Chairman of the Congressional International Anti-Piracy Caucus.

Goodlatte is a staunch advocate of a federal prohibition of [[online gambling]]. In 2006, he sponsored H.R. 4777, the [[Internet Gambling Prohibition Act]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d109:h.r.04777:|title=H.R.4777 - 109th Congress (2005-2006): Internet Gambling Prohibition Act|first=Goodlatte,|last=Bob|date=22 September 2006|website=thomas.loc.gov}}</ref>  In September 2006, working with then Iowa Congressman [[Jim Leach]], Goodlatte was a major House supporter of the [[SAFE Port Act|Unlawful Internet gambling Enforcement Act]] of 2006. The Act was passed at midnight the day Congress adjourned before the [[United States general elections, 2006|2006 elections]]. Prior to it being added to the [[Bill (proposed law)|bill]], the gambling provisions had not been debated by any [[United States Congressional committee|Congressional committee]].<ref>[http://www.gamblingandthelaw.com/columns/2006_act.htm Nelson Rose: The Unlawful Internet gambling Enforcement Act of 2006 Analyzed] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122054343/http://www.gamblingandthelaw.com/columns/2006_act.htm |date=January 22, 2009 }}</ref> The bill was made sure to exclude online gambling. They claimed moral reasons for pushing for a ban on Internet gambling, but critics charge that it was due to campaign contributions from Microsoft and Steam.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.casinogamblingweb.com/gambling-news/gambling-law/inside_the_goodlatte_conspiracy_the_good_fund_the_uigea_47855.html|title=Inside the Goodlatte Conspiracy|publisher=}}</ref>

Goodlatte invoked surveillance abuse against Martin Luther King Jr. in the context of alleged surveillance abuses against Trump 2016 campaign advisor Carter Page.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.com/story/2018/06/28/house-gop-attack-justice-department-680780|title=House Republicans launch multi-pronged attack on Trump's DOJ|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-06-28|language=en}}</ref>
