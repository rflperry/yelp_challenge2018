In 2014, Shuster was in a primary with Bedford County businessman Art Halvorson and Franklin County project manager Travis Schooley. The primary was held on May 20, 2014. Congressman Shuster won with 53% of the vote. Art Halvorson received 34% and Travis Schooley received 13%.

{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Pennsylvania, 2016#District 9|label 1=House elections in Pennsylvania, 2016}}

In 2016, Shuster won reelection in what would later turn out to be his eighth and final full term. He was challenged by Arthur Halvorson in the Republican primary, with Shuster only barely winning a majority, at 50.6%, in the two-way race. In a set of events that even Arthur Halvorson described as unprecedented, Halvorson received enough [[Write-in candidate|write-ins]] in the Democratic primary to become the Democratic Party's candidate in the 9th District. Halvorson, who is considered to be further to the right than Shuster, accepted the Democratic nomination, but vowed to causus as a conservative Republican if elected to Congress. In the general election, Shuster beat Halvorson again, this time with 63.3% of the vote.

Shuster announced in January 2018 that he wouldn't be seeking reelection later that year, and that he thus would be retiring with the end of the [[115th United States Congress|115th Congress]] in January 2019.<ref>https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/gop-rep-bill-shuster-to-retire-spend-final-year-working-with-trump-on-massive-infrastructure-bill</ref> The Congressman, who has been Chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure|House Transportation Committee]] since 2013, said he would be spending his final year in the House working with [[Donald Trump|President Trump]] on what he describes as a "massive infrastructure bill". Shuster cited his desire to pass such a bill, and the fact that worrying about getting reelected would distract from the bill, as reasons for his retirement.
