Lowey was first elected to the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] from [[New York's 20th congressional district]] in [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1988|1988]]. Following [[redistricting]] after the [[1990 United States Census|1990 Census]], Lowey was elected from the [[New York's 17th congressional district|17th district]]. Her district is located in the northern suburbs of [[New York City]] and includes most of [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester County]] including [[White Plains, New York|White Plains]], [[Chappaqua, New York|Chappaqua]], [[Greenburgh, New York|Greenburgh]], [[Ossining (town), New York|Ossining]] and all of [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland County]], including the county seat [[New City, New York|New City]], [[Haverstraw (village), New York|Haverstraw]], and [[Congers, New York|Congers]]. She used to represent some of the far northern portions of [[Queens]] and the [[Bronx]] until redistricting after the [[2000 United States Census|2000 Census]] removed the New York City portion of her district.

Lowey strongly considered [[New York United States Senate election, 2000|running for the United States Senate in 2000]], but stepped aside when [[First Lady of the United States]] [[Hillary Clinton]] announced her candidacy. Lowey was considered a top contender for appointment to Clinton's Senate seat after Clinton was nominated to be [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]], but in a December 1, 2008, phone interview with the [[Associated Press]], she stated that she isn't interested in giving up her senior seat on the House Appropriations Committee.<ref>[http://hosted.ap.org/dynamic/stories/C/CLINTON_SUCCESSOR?SITE=CASRP&SECTION=HOME&TEMPLATE=DEFAULT]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}</ref>

In 2004, Lowey received 69% of the vote against political newcomer [[Richard A. Hoffman]], a Wall Street investor and largely self-funded candidate who ran on a platform of opposing special interests and cutting federal taxes. Lowey emphasized her track record on homeland security issues, notably her work to reform the formula for distributing homeland security grants to states.

In 2006, also against Hoffman, Lowey won with 70%.

Lowey was re-elected to an eleventh term in 2008, with 68% of the vote against unsupported [[James C. Russell|James C. "Jim" Russell]].

===Tenure===
Lowey received an "A" on the [[Drum Major Institute]]'s 2005 [http://www.drummajorinstitute.com/congress/drum-major-voting-summary.php?name=Lowey&state=NY&database=house Congressional Scorecard] on middle-class issues. She received 12% on the [[Club for Growth]]'s 2007 congressional scorecard.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2008/05/the_2007_congressional_scoreca.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081106232842/http://www.clubforgrowth.org/2008/05/the_2007_congressional_scoreca.php |archivedate=2008-11-06 |df= }}</ref> According to the conservative [[Heritage Foundation]], Lowey consistently votes in support of the policies of the Democratic Party, and is seen as a strong and effective progressive voice in that legislative body.<ref>{{cite web |last=Baker |first=Jena |url=http://www.heritage.org/research/budget/wm2595.cfm |title=New Budget Estimates Show Unsustainable Spending and Debt &#124; The Heritage Foundation |publisher=Heritage.org |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100313055702/http://www.heritage.org/Research/Budget/wm2595.cfm |archivedate=2010-03-13 |df= }}</ref>

Her voting record on mass surveillance earned her a "D" on the [https://www.standagainstspying.org/scorecard Stand Against Spying Congressional Scorecard], which was created by a coalition of organizations and individuals from across the political spectrum advocating for transparency and an end to mass surveillance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://standagainstspying.org/scorecard/|title=Where do your representatives stand on illegal surveillance?|website=StandAgainstSpying.org|access-date=2018-03-14}}</ref>

Early in her Congressional career, Lowey sponsored an [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] for the purpose of "dredging the [[Mamaroneck (town), New York|Mamaroneck]] Harbor."<ref name=Carney>Carney, Timothy (2011-03-16) [http://washingtonexaminer.com/blogs/beltway-confidential/2011/03/government-yachters Government for the Yachters]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, ''[[Washington Examiner]]''</ref> According to the local newspaper, ''[[The Journal News]]'', the dredging was proposed because "the harbor was becoming too shallow 'to accommodate the larger [[yacht]]s.'"<ref name=Carney/>

In 2001–2002, Lowey served as the first female chair of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]. She was a member of the [[House Appropriations Committee]].{{When|date=February 2011}}

One of the notable causes she supports is the [[Corporation for Public Broadcasting]], in support of which she appeared at a congressional hearing accompanied  by ''[[Sesame Street]]'' characters Bert and Ernie.

Lowey has been a vocal advocate for a Security Council Resolution on the [[Darfur conflict|conflict in Darfur]]. She is responsible for the $500 million in the Emergency Spending Bill for Aid in Darfur. She is also pushing for $1.2 Billion in the next fiscal year.

Lowey voted for HR 2454, the "Cap and Trade" legislation.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aboutpolitics.com/politicians/New%20York-NY/Lowey/Budget,%20Spending%20and%20Taxes |title=Political Voting Records: New York-NY, Lowey: Budget, Spending and Taxes |publisher=Aboutpolitics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

Lowey voted for HR 1105, the 2009 Budget Bill.

David Paulison|David Paulison]] and Senator [[Hillary Clinton]], during 2007 floods in New York.]]In early 2009, Lowey introduced the Transportation Security Workforce Enhancement Act, which calls for collective bargaining rights for federal workers at the TSA and Department of Homeland Security.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/federal-eye/2009/07/tsa_closer_to_collective_barga.html |title=Federal Eye - Eye Opener: TSA Collective Bargaining Rights |publisher=Voices.washingtonpost.com |date=2009-07-09 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> However, some statements from the TSA dispute the necessity of collective bargaining.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/approach/mythbusters/tsa_workforce.shtm |title=TSA: Myth vs. Fact on the TSA Workforce |publisher=Tsa.gov |date= |accessdate=2010-08-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528101641/https://www.tsa.gov/approach/mythbusters/tsa_workforce.shtm |archivedate=2010-05-28 |df= }}</ref>

She was strongly critical of the [[Stupak-Pitts Amendment]], which places limits on taxpayer-funded abortions in the context of the November 2009, [[Affordable Health Care for America Act]]. Because of the rancor and disruptions which marked so many of the so-called Town Hall meetings held in the summer of 2009 to discuss Health Care Reform, Lowey chose to present her point of view on Health Care Reform in a telephone conference call, the effectiveness of which was questioned by some of her constituents.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://polhudson.lohudblogs.com/2009/08/07/are-telephone-town-hall-meetings-democratic/ |title=Are telephone Town Hall meetings Democratic? &#124; Politics on the Hudson |publisher=Polhudson.lohudblogs.com |date=2009-08-07 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref> However, Lowey routinely appears around her district to talk one-on-one with her constituents at town fairs, events and public meetings.

===Iran deal===
Lowey has announced her opposition to the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|nuclear deal with Iran]], stating that "In my judgment, sufficient safeguards are not in place to address the risks associated with the agreement.  Relieving UN sanctions on conventional arms and ballistic missiles and releasing billions of dollars to the Iranian regime could lead to a dangerous regional weapons race and enable Iran to bolster its funding of terrorists.   The deal does not explicitly require Iran to fully disclose its previous military work to the IAEA's satisfaction before sanctions relief is provided, and inspectors will not have immediate access to the most suspicious facilities. There are no clear accountability measures regarding punishment for minor violations, which could encourage Iran to cheat."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://lowey.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/lowey-opposes-p51-iran-agreement|title=Lowey Opposes P5+1 Iran Agreement|date=2015-08-04|work=Representative Nita Lowey|access-date=2018-03-14|language=en}}</ref>

=== 2016 superdelegate ===
Like all Democratic members of Congress, Lowey was a [[superdelegate]] to the [[2016 Democratic National Convention|2016, Democratic National Convention]], pledged to support [[Hillary Clinton]]. Lowey's chief of staff, when asked by the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' whether Lowey might switch her support to candidate [[Bernie Sanders]] if Sanders were to win the New York State Democratic presidential primary, said "absolutely not... Hillary Clinton is Congresswoman Lowey's friend, colleague and her constituent, and she is behind her 100%."<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/politics/new-york-superdelegates-largely-back-clinton-sanders-article-1.2581729|title=New York superdelegates largely back Clinton over Sanders|website=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-03-30}}</ref>

==Personal life==
Nita Lowey has been married to Stephen Lowey for over 45 years. Stephen Lowey is a named partner in the [[law firm]] of Lowey Dannenberg Cohen & Hart, P.C., which is located in [[White Plains, NY]]. According to the [[West Publishing|West Corporation]], his practice areas include [[Securities]] Law, [[Antitrust]] Law, and [[Consumer Protection]]. Nita and Stephen Lowey have three children, and eight grandchildren. The estimate of her personal asset wealth based on financial disclosures Congressional Representatives are required to provide (aside from that of personal residences and non-interest bearing bank accounts), puts Rep. Lowey's wealth at $41.2 million in 2010, based largely on her husband's investments.<ref name="Capitol Assets">{{cite news|last1=Fallis|first1=David S.|last2=Higham|first2=Scott|last3=Kindy|first3=Kimberly|title=Special Report: Capitol Assets: Nita Lowey|url=https://apps.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitol-assets/member/nita-lowey/|accessdate=March 3, 2015|publisher=Washington Post|date=2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150205104456/http://apps.washingtonpost.com/politics/capitol-assets/member/nita-lowey/|archive-date=February 5, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> This is derived from a special investigative series of asset wealth of all U.S. Congressional Representatives conducted by ''[[The Washington Post]]''.<ref name="Capitol Assets"/>
