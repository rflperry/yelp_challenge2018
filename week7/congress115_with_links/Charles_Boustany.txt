The district, numbered as the [[Louisiana's 7th congressional district|7th District]] from 2005 to 2013, is located in the southwestern portion of the state and includes [[Lafayette, Louisiana|Lafayette]] and [[Lake Charles, Louisiana|Lake Charles]].

He was succeeded in the House of Representatives by [[Clay Higgins]], a Republican who is a [[Lafayette Police Department (Louisiana)|Lafayette law enforcement officer]] residing outside the district in [[St. Landry Parish, Louisiana|St. Landry Parish]].

==Early life, education, and medical career==
Boustany was born in [[Lafayette, Louisiana]], the son of Madlyn M. (née Ackal) and Charles W. Boustany, Sr. (1930–2009); his paternal grandparents, Alfred Frem Boustany and Florida (née Saloom), were [[immigrant]]s from [[Lebanon]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~battle/reps/boustany.htm|title=1|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> His maternal grandparents were also Lebanese.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=AD&p_theme=ad&p_action=search&p_maxdocs=200&p_topdoc=1&p_text_direct-0=11563C1F1D7EFAC8&p_field_direct-0=document_id&p_perpage=10&p_sort=YMD_date:D&s_trackval=GooglePM|title=NewsLibrary Search Results|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2004
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2004#District 7}}
In 2004, incumbent Democrat U.S. Congressman [[Chris John]] of [[Louisiana's 7th congressional district]] decided to retire in order to run for the U.S. Senate.  John had held the district for eight years without serious difficulty, even though it had been trending increasingly Republican at the national level. Boustany jumped into the race with another Republican, the late [[David Thibodaux]] of Lafayette, Democratic state senator [[Willie Mount]] of Lake Charles and Democratic state representative [[Don Cravins Jr.]] of [[Opelousas, Louisiana|Opelousas]]. In the open primary election, Boustany ranked first with 39 percent, with Mount garnering 25 percent for second place.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4774|title=Our Campaigns - LA District 07 - Initial Election Race|date=November 2, 2004|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> Under Louisiana's [[nonpartisan blanket primary]] system, in the event no candidate wins a "50 percent plus one vote" total, a [[runoff election|runoff]] is conducted between the two top candidates, regardless of party.

[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Dick Cheney]] campaigned on behalf of Boustany. In the December 4 run-off election, Boustany defeated Mount 55–45 percent.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=139350|title=Our Campaigns - LA District 07 - Runoff Race|date=December 4, 2004|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> He was only the second Republican to represent the district, the first having been [[Jimmy Hayes]], who switched from Democratic affiliation in 1995.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Louisiana, 2012#District 3}}
After Louisiana lost a district in redistricting, most of Boustany's territory became the 3rd District. He faced freshman fellow Republican and 3rd District incumbent [[Jeff Landry]] of [[New Iberia, Louisiana|New Iberia]].  Although the district was numerically Landry's district, it was geographically and demographically more Boustany's district.  Indeed, the new 3rd contained almost two-thirds of Boustany's former territory, while Landry retained only the western third of his former district. Landry led Boustany in third-quarter 2011 fundraising, $251,000 to $218,000. According to [[Federal Election Commission]], Boustany led in cash-on-hand lead, $1.1 million – $402,000.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/davidcatanese/1111/Citizens_United_goes_all_in_for_Landry_.html?showall|title=Citizens United goes all in for Landry|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}</ref> In addition to Boustany and Landry, a third Republican, state Representative [[Chris Leopold]] of [[Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana|Plaquemines Parish]], announced via [[Facebook]] his candidacy for the seat,<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/LeopoldforCongress?v=info|title=Chris Leopold for Congress|publisher=facebook.com|accessdate=May 18, 2012}}</ref> but he never filed the paperwork.

The Boustany-Landry race attracted most of the political attention in Louisiana in 2012, as it was seen as pitting an establishment Republican against a candidate identifying with the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]].  Though most politicians shunned involvement in the heated race,  [[Louisiana Department of Agriculture and Forestry|Louisiana Commissioner of Agriculture and Forestry]] [[Michael G. Strain]] endorsed Boustany, whom he described as particularly helpful to the agricultural sector while serving as a U.S. representative. Landry, meanwhile, carried the backing of most of the Republican parish executive committees in the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/news/4281456-123/boustany-gets-strains-support|title=Jordan Blum, "Boustany gets Strain's support"|publisher=''Baton Rouge Morning Advocate''|accessdate=October 31, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301210848/http://theadvocate.com/news/4281456-123/boustany-gets-strains-support|archivedate=March 1, 2014|df=}}</ref> Landry also was endorsed by [[Phyllis Schlafly]]'s [[Eagle Forum]] political action committee.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.eagleforum.org/election/endorse.html|title=Candidates endorsed by Eagle Forum PAC|date=October 31, 2012|publisher=eagleforum.org|accessdate=November 3, 2012}}</ref>

In the November 6 election, technically a nonpartisan blanket primary for Congress, Boustany led Landry by 45,596 votes. In a five-candidate field, Boustany received 139,123 votes (45 percent); Landry received 93,527 votes (30 percent). Democrat Ron Richard procured the critical 67,070 votes (22 percent). The remaining 7,908 votes (2 percent) and 3,765 ballots (1 percent) were cast, respectively, for Republican Bryan Barrilleaux and the Libertarian Jim Stark. Because no candidate received a majority, Boustany and Landry met in a runoff contest held on December 8.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/11062012/11062012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns, November 6, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>

Boustany won the runoff election against Landry with 58,820 votes (61 percent). He had large margins in seven of the ten parishes in the district, particularly in [[Acadia Parish, Louisiana|Acadia]], [[Calcasieu Parish, Louisiana|Calcasieu]], and [[Lafayette Parish, Louisiana|Lafayette]] but lost the three parishes that Landry represents, [[St. Martin Parish, Louisiana|St. Martin]], [[Iberia Parish, Louisiana|Iberia]], and [[St. Mary Parish, Louisiana|St. Mary]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://staticresults.sos.la.gov/12082012/12082012_Congressional.html|title=Louisiana election returns|date=December 8, 2012|publisher=staticresults.sos.la.gov|accessdate=November 10, 2012}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Boustany presented the Republican response to [[Barack Obama speech to joint session of Congress, September 2009|President Barack H. Obama's joint address to Congress on Wednesday September 9, 2009]]. He was the sponsor of H.R. 1173, the Fiscal Responsibility and Retirement Security Act of 2011.  The bill would repeal title VIII of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] which established a voluntary long-term care insurance program.  It passed the house 267–159 on February 1, 2012<ref>{{cite web|title=The Library of Congress – Thomas|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d112:HR01173:@@@L&summ2=m&}}</ref> but was never passed by the Senate.

In 2013, Boustany was a sponsor of the [[United States farm bill]], which was rejected 234–195 in votes, with sixty-two Republicans voting against.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.kplctv.com/story/22648040/louisiana-officials-weigh-in-on-farm-bills-failure|title=Louisiana officials weigh in on farm bill's failure|last1=Weston|first1=Elona|date=June 20, 2013|publisher=[[KPLC]]|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

==2016 U.S. Senate campaign==
{{main|United States Senate election in Louisiana, 2016}}
Boustany ran for the open U.S. Senate seat held by retiring Republican [[David Vitter]], and on election day he received 15.4 percent of the vote at third place, not enough to advance to the run-off.

==Personal life==
Boustany's wife Bridget Edwards is a daughter of the late Acadia Parish assistant district attorney Nolan Edwards (1930–1983) of [[Crowley, Louisiana|Crowley]] and Eleanor Merrill of [[Longboat Key, Florida]]. Nolan Edwards was shot to death in his law office by a disgruntled client.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.crowleypostsignal.com/pages/full_story/push?article-Boustany-+Dugal+-to+unite+in+holy+matrimony%20&id=12832286&instance=secondary_stories_left_column |title=Boustany, Dugal to unite in holy matrimony, May 2011 |publisher=''Crowley Post Signal'' |accessdate=December 9, 2012 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&dat=19830819&id=pvtEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=pfsDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5444,1126713|title=Former client kills self, ex-governor's brother in Louisiana|publisher=''[[Lakeland Ledger]]'', [[Lakeland, Florida]], August 19, 1983|accessdate=December 9, 2012}}</ref> Bridget Boustany is hence a paternal niece of Democratic former [[Governor of Louisiana|Governor]] [[Edwin Washington Edwards]].<ref>Jim Brown, [http://www.jimbrownla.com/columns/090204_lagop.pdf "Internal Republican Battles Affect La.
