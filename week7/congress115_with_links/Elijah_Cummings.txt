He became a member of the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] and graduated in 1973 with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in [[Political Science]].

Cummings graduated from [[law school]] at the [[University of Maryland School of Law]], receiving his [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]] in 1976.  He was admitted to the Maryland Bar in December 1976. He practiced law for 19 years before first being elected to the House in the [[U.S. House election, 1996|1996 elections]].

Also after graduating from law school, Cummings received 12 honorary doctoral degrees from different universities across America, most recently an honorary doctorate of public service from the [[University of Maryland, College Park]] in 2017.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://cummings.house.gov/about/full-biography|title=Biography|date=2012-12-11|newspaper=Congressman Elijah Cummings|access-date=2016-12-04}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/rep-elijah-cummings-to-give-commencement-address/2017/12/19/f0e29956-e491-11e7-927a-e72eac1e73b6_story.html|title=Rep.

For 14 years, Cummings served in the [[Maryland House of Delegates]]. His predecessor, Lena King Lee, raised funds and campaigned for him; years later, Cummings credited her with launching his political career.<ref>{{cite news |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=Pioneering Md. Delegate, Educator Lena Lee, 100 |date=August 28, 2006 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/27/AR2006082700916.html |accessdate=December 11, 2017}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |newspaper=The Washington Examiner |title=Post office branch renamed in tribute to pioneering delegate |date=June 3, 2006 |accessdate=December 12, 2017 |url=http://www.washingtonexaminer.com/post-office-branch-renamed-in-tribute-to-pioneering-delegate/article/56447}}</ref> In the [[Maryland General Assembly]], he served as Chairman of the [[Legislative Black Caucus of Maryland]] and was the first Black man in Maryland history to be named [[Speaker Pro Tempore]], the second highest position in the House of Delegates.

Cummings also serves on many different boards and commissions both inside and outside of Baltimore City. Some of those include SEED Schools of Maryland Board of Directors and the University of Maryland Board of Advisors. He is a member of [[Phi Beta Sigma]] fraternity.

In December 2010 [[Edolphus Towns]] announced that he would not seek the position of [[Ranking Minority Member]] of the Oversight Committee in the next Congress, even though his [[List of current members of the United States House of Representatives by seniority|seniority]] and service as Chair would typically result in him filling this post. Reportedly, Towns withdrew because of a lack of support from [[Nancy Pelosi]] who feared that he would not be a sufficiently aggressive leader of Democrats in an anticipated struggle with incoming committee chair Republican [[Darrell Issa]].<ref name="tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com">{{cite web|author=Brian Beutler |url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2010/12/pelosi-power-play-doomed-towns-on-oversight-committee.php |title=Pelosi Power Play Doomed Towns On Oversight Committee &#124; TPMDC |publisher=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com |date=December 16, 2010 |accessdate=July 15, 2012}}</ref>

Cummings is a member of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Caucus Members|author=|url=https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=71&sectiontree=2,71|format=|publisher=Congressional Progressive Caucus|date=|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> He served as Chairman of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|author=|url=https://cbc.house.gov/membership/|format=|publisher=Congressional Black Caucus|date=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref> during the [[108th United States Congress]].

Cummings received praise and a boost in notoriety following the Congressional panel hearings on [[Anabolic steroid|steroids]] in March 2005. While investigating the use of [[Doping in sport|steroids in sports]], the panel called numerous [[Doping in baseball|baseball]] players to testify, including former single season home run record holder [[Mark McGwire]]. After McGwire answered many questions in a vague fashion, Cummings demanded to know if he was "taking the Fifth", referring to the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]]. McGwire responded by saying, "I am here to talk about the future, not about the past."  The exchange came to epitomize the entire inquiry.

===Legislation===
Cummings introduced the [[Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014]], a bipartisan bill signed into law by President [[Barack Obama]] in December 2014.  The bill, which Cummings cosponsored with Representative [[Darrell Issa]], Republican of California, is a set of amendments to the [[Federal Records Act]] and [[Presidential Records Act]]. Among other provisions, the bill modernizes the definition of a federal record to expressly include electronic documents.<ref name="NARA2014">[https://www.archives.gov/press/press-releases/2015/nr15-23.html National Archives Welcomes Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014] (press release), [[National Archives and Records Administration]] (December 1, 2014).</ref><ref name="GovExec">Charles S.

Cummings supported the [[Smart Savings Act]], a bill that would make the default investment in the [[Thrift Savings Plan]] (TSP) an age-appropriate [[Target date fund|target date asset allocation investment fund]] (L Fund) instead of the Government Securities Investment Fund (G Fund).<ref name=4193sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4193 - Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4193|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=July 14, 2014}}</ref> Cummings called the bill a "commonsense change" and argued that the bill "will enable workers to take full advantage of a [[Diversification (finance)|diversified]] fund designed to yield higher returns".<ref name=CommitteePRMar12>{{cite web|title=Oversight Committee Passes Bipartisan Bills to Improve Federal Worker Savings, Whistleblower Protections|url=http://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-passes-bipartisan-bills-improve-federal-worker-savings-whistleblower-protections/|publisher=House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform|accessdate=July 14, 2014|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref>

Cummings introduced the [[All Circuit Review Extension Act]], a bill that would extend for three years the authority for federal employees who appeal a judgment of the [[Merit Systems Protection Board]] (MSPB) to file their appeal at any federal court, instead of only the [[United States courts of appeals|U.S. Court of Appeals]].<ref name=cbo4197>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4197|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45233|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=July 15, 2014}}</ref> Cummings said that this program is important to extend because it "allows whistleblowers to file appeals where they live rather than being limited to the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals".<ref name=CommitPR1>{{cite web|title=Oversight Committee Passes Bipartisan Bills to Improve Federal Worker Savings, Whistleblower Protections|url=http://oversight.house.gov/release/oversight-committee-passes-bipartisan-bills-improve-federal-worker-savings-whistleblower-protections/|publisher=House Committee on Oversight & Government Reform|accessdate=July 15, 2014|date=March 12, 2014}}</ref> He also said that the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals has "an abysmal track record in whistleblower cases".<ref name="CommitPR1"/>

In remarks at the [[2016 Democratic National Convention]], Cumming declared: "Our party does not just believe, but understands, that [[Black Lives Matter]]. But we also recognize that our community and our law enforcement work best when they work together."<ref>Dan Spinelli, [https://www.politico.com/story/2016/07/elijah-cummings-black-lives-matter-226157 Cummings declares 'Black Lives Matter' in convention speech], ''Politico'' (July 25, 2016).</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?c4613322/representative-elijah-cummings-delivers-remarks-democratic-national-convention|title=Representative Elijah Cummings Delivers Remarks at the Democratic National Convention|website=C-SPAN.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-03}}</ref>

[[File:Elijah Cummings (3080908579) (cropped).jpg|thumb|right|Cummings speaking at the [[2008 Democratic National Convention]]]]
Five-term Congressman [[Kweisi Mfume]] resigned in February 1996 to take the presidency of the [[NAACP]]. Cummings won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic, black-majority district—with 37.5% of the vote. In the special election, he defeated [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] Kenneth Kondner with over 80 percent of the vote.  He defeated Kondner again in November by a similar margin to win the seat in his own right.

Cummings has been reelected nine times since then with no substantive opposition, never dropping below 69% of the vote and even running unopposed in 2006.
