=== Agriculture and Economic Development ===
Largely composed of rural communities and farm families, support and representation for farmers and rural economic development is imperative for many constituents in the 7th district. When elected to Congress in 1996, Mike McIntyre obtained a seat on the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|U.S. House Committee on Agriculture]] and by retirement was the second highest ranking member. In 2009, McIntyre was elected Chairman of the [[United States House Agriculture Subcommittee on Rural Development, Research, Biotechnology, and Foreign Agriculture|Subcommittee on Rural Development, Biotechnology, Specialty Crops, and Foreign Agriculture]]. Through the years, he also served on the following subcommittees: General Commodities, Livestock and Horticulture; Conservation, Energy and Forestry; Livestock, Rural Development and Credit; Conservation, Credit, Energy and Research. McIntyre additionally served as Chairman of the Rural Caucus Task Force on Jobs, Economic Development and Transportation and later became Co-Chairman of the entire Rural Caucus.

Notably, McIntyre co-authored and co-sponsored legislation with Rep. Bill Jenkins (TN) titled, [[Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act|The Fair and Equitable Tobacco Reform Act]], otherwise known as the "tobacco buyout." This legislation was the result of many years of work in an effort to relieve suffering tobacco farmers and after a long debate, this landmark legislation was signed into law as part of the [[American Jobs Creation Act of 2004|American Jobs Creation Act]] in 2004. The tobacco buyout eliminated the quota and price support system that was in place and provided $10.1 billion in payments made over ten years to tobacco quota owners and growers for the elimination of their government created quotas. These payments, known as the Tobacco Transition Payment Program, allowed farmers to reduce debt and diversify or expand operations in tobacco and other farm enterprises such as vineyards. The last payment was made in January, 2014.

Business and economic development was always at the forefront of McIntyre's agenda and his work has focused on promoting jobs, workforce development and business opportunities. As Chairman of the House Subcommittee on Rural Development, McIntyre supported the Microenterprise Business and Rural Entrepreneur Program to help businesses which employ less than 10 people. He worked closely with [[USDA Rural Development]] throughout his years in Congress to bring funding for town halls, public works facilities, day care centers, fire and rescue stations, police departments, courthouses, small businesses, housing assistance, health care facilities, hospitals and other public needs to southeastern North Carolina.

McIntyre also worked on legislation to establish the Southeast Crescent Regional Commission which was signed into law as part of the [[Food, Conservation, and Energy Act of 2008|2008 Farm Bill]]. The purpose of the commission is to alleviate poverty and promote economic growth in the most distressed areas of the southeastern United States. The commission awards grants to areas in need to fund projects that meet the criteria for community betterment, including infrastructure, education and training, entrepreneurship, and leadership development.

McIntyre was well-known for his coordination of the annual North Carolina Business and Economic Summit in Washington, initially called "The Washington Perspective" and later called "Taking Care of Business", which attracted approximately 250 business, Chamber of Commerce and civic leaders annually in September. These events were co-hosted by two other congressmen originally and currently has almost the entire congressional delegation continuing this popular tradition.

McIntyre has received significant recognition for his work in the agriculture and economic development arenas. He was named as the first recipient ever of an international award in public policy by the International Association of Personnel in Employment Security for his efforts to produce job opportunities and increase worker training. The National Association of Development Organizations honored him for his leadership in regional economic development, and the Southern Economic Development Council has chosen him five times for its Legislative Honor Roll. In 2002, he won the North Carolina Employment Security Advancing Workforce Development Award. McIntyre's service to agriculture has been recognized by numerous agricultural organizations including the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]], the [[National Farmers Union (United States)|National Farmers Union]], and the [[AgFirst|AgFirst Farm Credit Bank]]. In 2007, he was named National Legislator of the Year by the National Farm Service Agency Employees Association. He had received the Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award from the Robeson County Crop Promotion Association in 1998 and subsequently received the North Carolina Distinguished Service to Agriculture Award from the N.C. Farm Bureau in 2014.

=== Coastal Communities ===
As the U.S. Representative of many coastal communities, Mike McIntyre was instrumental in securing over half a billion dollars in funding to ensure the beaches, waterways, inlets and ports of North Carolina's 7th District were adequately maintained. He was founder and co-chairman of the Congressional Waterways Caucus, was co-chairman of the Congressional Boating Caucus, and was a member of the House Coastal Caucus and House Oceans Caucus. For his work on beach and waterway issues, McIntyre was named Coastal Advocate of the Year by the [[American Shore and Beach Preservation Association]]; received the Admiral's Circle Award from the [https://www.nmma.org/ National Marine Manufacturers Association]; received the Conservationist Award from the [http://coastallandtrust.org/ NC Coastal Land Trust]; received the J.W. Pate Award from the [http://cfra-nc.org/ Cape Fear River Assembly]; and was named Beach Preservationist of the Year by the [http://www.oakislandnc.com/General-Info/Beach-Preservation-Society.aspx Oak Island Beach Preservation Society].

=== Constituent Services ===
Constituent service was a top priority for McIntyre, and his work on behalf of constituents was considered first-rate by citizens who worked with him and his staff which handled constituent work in both the Washington and district offices.

McIntyre placed a sign in the entry area of his office that stated: "This Office Belongs to the People of the Seventh Congressional District."

Helping a veteran obtain his or her medals earned during their service, assisting senior citizens with their social security or Medicare benefits, helping a citizen obtain a passport for travel, or personally welcoming constituents to the nation's capital, McIntyre's work and his staff's work were well-known.

=== Healthcare ===
During his time in office, McIntyre was a member and former co-chairman of the House Rural Health Care Coalition which advocates for advancing rural priorities in health care. Additionally, he was a member of several Congressional caucuses that worked to prevent disease and secure research funding including the Congressional Community Pharmacy Caucus, Congressional Diabetes Caucus, the House Cancer Caucus, the House Vision Caucus, and the Youth Sports Caucus.

For his work on rural health care initiatives, McIntyre has been named a "Super Hero" six times by the [http://nachc.org/ National Association of Community Health Centers]. He was also presented with the [https://www.ruralhealthweb.org National Rural Health Association’s] Legislative award in 2000 (as one of five Representatives) and in 2003 (as the only Representative) for demonstrating great dedication to the health of rural Americans.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.ruralhealthweb.org/about-nrha/rural-health-awards/legislative-award-winners|title=NRHA Legislative Award Winners|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref>

=== Military and Veterans' Affairs ===
Working on legislation to support the nation's armed forces was of particular importance to Mike McIntyre, who represented a district that initially was home to four major military bases, Camp Lejeune, New River Air Station, Fort Bragg, and Pope Air Force Base, as well as Military Ocean Terminal Sunny Point, three Coast Guard stations and several National Guard armories. McIntyre served on the [[United States House Committee on Armed Services|House Armed Services Committee]] for the duration of his time in office and was the third highest ranking member by retirement. He was Vice-Chairman of the Special Oversight Panel on Terrorism, the top Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces, and a member of the Subcommittee on Tactical Air and Land Forces.

McIntyre was Co-Founder and Co-Chairman of the Special Operations Forces Caucus, which was started in an effort to recognize the critical role that [[Special forces|Special Operations Forces]] and the [[United States Special Operations Command|U.S. Special Operations Command]] have in national security missions. For his work, McIntyre has been recognized by the [http://www.afa.org/home Air Force Association], [https://www.legion.org/ American Legion], [https://www.dav.org/ Association of the U.S. Army, Disabled American Veterans], [https://navyleague.org/ Navy League], [https://specialforcescharitabletrust.org/ Special Forces Charitable Trust], and the [http://www.vfw.org/ VFW]. He received the Charles Dick Medal of Merit Award from the North Carolina National Guard in the year 2000 for his strong support of the National Guard and national defense. He has also been inducted as an Honorary Member of the Fleet Reserve Command, made an Honorary Life Member of the [http://www.moaa-nc.org/ N.C. Chapter of the Military Officers Association of America], and presented the [[Navy Distinguished Public Service Award|Distinguished Public Service Award]] from the [[United States Secretary of the Navy|U.S. Secretary of the Navy]], its highest civilian honor.

Additionally, McIntyre was a voice in Washington for North Carolina veterans. During his tenure in Congress, McIntyre helped secure funds for several new Veterans Affairs clinics, including a dialysis center in Fayetteville, N.C. He successfully advocated for the establishment of two additional veterans' health clinics in Robeson and Brunswick counties, as well as the building of a new veterans regional health center in Wilmington. McIntyre was awarded National Legislator of the Year in 2008 and the All-American Hero Award in 2009 and 2013 for work advocating on behalf of veterans, including support of an annual Military Construction and VA Appropriations bill that adequately meets the needs of veterans. He supported the authorization for the construction nationally of five new polytrauma centers and three Centers of Excellence in Mental Health, and was also an original co-sponsor of the Joshua Omvig Veterans Suicide Prevention Act, which was passed by the U.S. House and provides outreach, education, and training to VA staff to ensure that veterans are receiving adequate mental health care.

=== NASA ===
McIntyre has always been a supporter of NASA and the space program, stating the following: "Not only does space exploration inspire and excite, but it also has numerous practical benefits to people everywhere: from GPS to pacemakers; from microwave ovens to highly advanced computing systems; from water purification to search and rescue missions; from cancer therapy to robotics; from lightweight, durable metals to power generation of energy and telecommunications; from solar cells and batteries to recycling and waste management. Technological improvements affecting weather predictions, storm monitoring, agricultural production and global transportation have greatly affected our lives and helped our environment on earth. Fascination with the vastness of God's creation and the make-up of the universe is a never-ending discovery that always inspires us and advances our ingenuity and imagination and increases greatly our education in so many fields of learning and human endeavor. Indeed, there are no limits to space exploration and the discoveries made by the human spirit."

=== Senior Citizens ===
McIntyre was recognized with a pair of boxing gloves from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare because of his advocacy work on behalf of senior citizens. He also received the M.V.P. Award for the entire Congress from the TREA Senior Citizens League in 2004 and later received the Seniors Advocate Award for his legislative leadership on behalf of seniors in 2012.

=== Youth Sports ===
Advocacy for youth sports was a priority during Mike McIntyre's congressional career. He coached youth sports in Robeson County for several years in T-ball, baseball, football, and basketball, including three All-American Drug-Free teams. McIntyre was the first volunteer coach in the county to be certified by the National Youth Sports Coaches Association and the first to qualify his teams for the All-American Drug-Free Team based on character development and drug education and awareness. He was a charter member of, and helped to incorporate, the Lumberton Youth Baseball Association, which has subsequently spawned several championship teams on the regional, state, and national levels.

Congressman McIntyre is the Founder and Chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Youth Sports. Through cooperative efforts with the Citizenship through Sports Alliance, McIntyre and former NBA star [[Clark Kellogg]], now a CBS Sports analyst and commentator, presented a National Report Card on the State of Youth Sports in 2005 at the National Press Club in Washington. Their goal was to draw attention to the need for greater respect, cooperation, discipline, and commitment to youth sports. Having introduced a Youth Sports Legislative Agenda, McIntyre has also hosted three regional youth sports conferences and has worked with the NFL, NBA, NHL, PGA, NCAA, U.S. Soccer, U.S. Tennis and the U.S. Olympic Committee in promoting youth sports, fitness, and recreation nationally.

Because of his commitment, Congressman McIntyre has been given several honors and recognitions. He was honored with the National Congressional Award in 2006 by the National Recreation and Park Association for his leadership in promoting youth sports and recreational programs.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.parksandrecreation.org/2014/July/Supporting-Youth-Sports-in-Congress/|title=Supporting Youth Sports in Congress|last=Wolf|first=Kaitlin Helms|date=1 July 2014|website=|publisher=Parks and Recreation|access-date=2 December 2016}}</ref> He was also recognized by the Positive Coaching Alliance for his promotion of teamwork, commitment, persistence, empathy, and leadership among young athletes. In 2008, he was named an International Sports Ethics Fellow by the [http://www.internationalsport.org/ Institute for International Sport] in recognition of his leadership through positive example. His selection placed him among a unique group of sports celebrities such as [[Grant Hill]], [[David Robinson (basketball)|David Robinson]], [[Mia Hamm]], and [[Jeff Gordon]].

Congressman McIntyre continued to play sports and pursue a healthy lifestyle throughout his years in Congress. He played second base on the Congressional Baseball Team for a number of years, participated in Congressional Basketball and Football Games, as well as tennis, soccer and golf matches. These charitable events benefitted organizations such as the Boys and Girls Clubs, the Literary Council, and efforts to fight breast cancer, prostate cancer, and homelessness. In 2012, he earned his black belt in Taekwondo from Grand Master Jhoon Rhee, an instructor of boxing champion [[Muhammad Ali]] and martial arts star [[Bruce Lee]]. Additionally, he earned the Presidential Champion Gold Award given under a tiered system designed to encourage physical activity and sponsored by the President's Council on Physical Fitness and Sports.

=== Notable Achievements ===

==== Black History Celebrations & Recognitions ====
Congressman McIntyre had a strong relationship with the African-American community, and he was one of only two congressmen known to both host and sponsor his own event in recognition of Black History Month. Each year he would honor African-American elected officials from all levels of government throughout his district, and he would invite a colleague from the Congressional Black Caucus as his special guest of honor to come to southeastern North Carolina for the celebration, which regularly drew hundreds of attendees over the years. McIntyre also obtained appropriations for expansion of the African-American cultural center in Robeson County, where many of the celebrations were held. He was honored for his work by several African-American churches and communities through the years.

==== Lumbee Recognition Bills ====
McIntyre was a well-known champion of the fight for federal recognition of the Lumbee Tribe, which has its tribal headquarters in his home county of Robeson and is the largest tribe east of the Mississippi River. Twice McIntyre successfully shepherded federal recognition bills through Congress, putting together a coalition of Democrats, Republicans, liberals, moderates and conservatives, after he personally lobbied his colleagues one-by-one. McIntyre argued that recognition for them was a matter of dignity and respect and would help the tribe with funding for education, health care and economic development. The House passed the bill he introduced in 2007 by a veto-proof margin (despite the Bush administration's opposition) of two-thirds of the House. The bill passed again in 2009 and was supported by the Obama administration. Both times, however, the Senate failed to bring the measure in that chamber to the floor for a vote.

==== Prayer Caucus Leadership ====
McIntyre was Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which had over 100 members. The caucus met regularly on the first night of each week that Congress was in session—just across the hall from the House chamber to pray for wisdom for decisions to be made that week and to pray for constituents' needs in their communities back home.

McIntyre also had the opportunity to serve as Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Breakfast, which is for current and former Members of Congress. This weekly breakfast is a time when these individuals get together to pray for each other and to hear testimony from a fellow colleague in Congress.

In this capacity, McIntyre has also spoken briefly at the National Prayer Breakfast, which has occurred every year with every President since Eisenhower. Nearly 3000 lay leaders, clergy, business leaders and other citizens join various world leaders, the Joint Chiefs of Staff from the Pentagon, Senators, Members of Congress and other persons from the three branches of government, gathered in Washington for this event on the first Thursday in February.

At the National Day of Prayer Ceremony on Capitol Hill, which occurs on the first Thursday in May in conjunction with the national celebration, McIntyre was invited twice to speak on behalf of the Legislative Branch of Government.

In 2006 the Center for Christian Statesmanship selected him as the Distinguished Christian Statesman of the Year for "his character, leadership, integrity and faithfulness in public service."

==== Scottish-American Relations ====
North Carolina's 7th district includes the largest number of Scottish-American descendants in the United States. McIntyre co-founded and co-chaired the Friends of Scotland caucus and was the original sponsor of the unanimously passed H.Res. 41 "Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as '[[Tartan Day|National Tartan Day]]' to recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by Scottish-Americans to the United States."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-resolution/41|title=H.Res.41 - Expressing the sense of the House of Representatives that a day should be established as "National Tartan Day" to recognize the outstanding achievements and contributions made by Scottish-Americans to the United States.|last=|first=|date=|website=www.congress.gov|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-16}}</ref>

In 2008, McIntyre came to the rescue for Scottish literature and poetry when it was discovered that the Library of Congress had made changes to its world renowned classification system, removing 40 headings and subheadings for Scottish writing and moving the body of work under the "English" classification heading. This move garnered concerns and protests from academics, writers, government ministers and many others. First Minister Alex Salmond called McIntyre about the matter while he was en route to Scotland on Armed Services business. The Washington Post noted that Linda Fabiani, the Minister of Culture in Edinburgh also lobbied McIntyre while he was visiting the country to see what he could do. Within the scope of a few phone calls, the changes were reversed by the Library of Congress and the Librarian of Congress, James H. Billington, issued a letter to the National Library of Scotland.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/01/14/AR2008011402485.html|title=Scottish? English? Library Thinks Twice|last=Wade|first=Mike|date=2008-01-15|work=Washington Post|access-date=January 20, 2016|via=}}</ref>

As a token of gratitude for McIntyre's leadership during his Congressional career, the Scottish Parliament passed a motion (S4M-10778) on December 8, 2014 at the First Minister's request, recognizing McIntyre's contributions to Scotland's relationship with the United States and congratulating him on his retirement from Congress.

==== Youth Initiatives and Volunteering in Schools ====
The Seventh Congressional District Annual Youth Leadership Summit, which McIntyre organized and hosted, has been heralded by educators, young people and their parents alike. McIntyre invited all public and private schools in his district to send an outstanding junior to a one-day seminar to discuss issues that affected their communities and also to propose ways in which to resolve them, encouraging the students to have a direct impact on their local communities.

In addition, McIntyre was well-known for his school volunteer work, which started when he first began his law career in 1981 when he organized the Robeson County Bar Association's Citizenship Education Committee. He continued throughout his congressional career to volunteer in the schools and has done so for over 35 years. From the Washington Workshops Foundation to the John C. Stennis Program for Congressional Interns on Capitol Hill, from elementary schools to graduate & professional schools, from hosting students in his office, to being invited as a freshman his first year in office to the Presidents' Summit for America's Future because of his long history of involvement in helping young people, McIntyre's work with youth and his inspirational speeches to school assemblies, in the classrooms and at events on Capitol Hill have reached thousands of students for more than three decades. He was recognized for his work with educators and youth prior to serving in Congress in 1989 with the Governor's Award for Outstanding Volunteer Service and during his congressional career with the North Carolina Parent – Teachers' Association (PTA) bestowing upon him an honorary life membership.
