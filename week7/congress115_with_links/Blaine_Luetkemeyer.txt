Luetkemeyer is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]].

==Early life==
Luetkemeyer was born in [[Jefferson City, Missouri|Jefferson City]] on May 7, 1952.<ref name=washpost>{{cite web| title = Members of Congress: Blaine Luetkemeyer| publisher = The Washington Post| url = http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/l000569/| accessdate = 2 January 2011| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110228210107/http://projects.washingtonpost.com/congress/members/L000569| archivedate = 28 February 2011| df = }}</ref> He attended [[Lincoln University of Missouri|Lincoln University]] in Jefferson City and graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts]] degree in [[political science]] and with a minor in [[business administration]]. A lifelong farmer who is the fourth generation of his family to own their farm, Luetkemeyer has also owned several small businesses, as well as running a bank and serving as an insurance agent. He also served on the board of trustees for the village of [[St. Elizabeth, Missouri|St. Elizabeth]].

==Missouri state politics==
In 1998, Luetkemeyer was elected to the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] from the 115th Legislative District.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://sos.mo.gov/archives/history/historicallistings/molegl.asp|title=Missouri Legislators L|last=IT|first=Missouri Secretary of State -|website=sos.mo.gov|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-15}}</ref> During his time as a state representative, Luetkemeyer served as chair of the Financial Services Committee and as House Republican Caucus Chairman. During his time in the state legislature, Luetkemeyer co-sponsored the statewide constitutional amendment defining marriage as being between a man and a woman, which was overwhelmingly approved by Missouri voters statewide in 2004 by a margin of 71-29. He also worked on legislation which allowed Missourians to carry concealed firearms, banned partial-birth abortions, and reformed worker compensation laws. In addition, he has supported the deregulation of the financial industry—specifically the lending industry.

In 2004, he did not seek reelection but instead was one of seven Republicans who ran for the office of [[Missouri State Treasurer|State Treasurer]]. He finished second in the Republican primary, losing to [[Sarah Steelman]] who went on to win the general election. In 2005, Luetkemeyer was appointed by former [[Governor of Missouri|Governor]] [[Matt Blunt]] to serve as Missouri Tourism Director, a post he held until running for the [[U.S. House of Representatives]] in 2008. One of his projects was working with Blunt and [[Lieutenant Governor of Missouri|Lt. Governor]] [[Peter Kinder]] to start the [[Tour of Missouri]], a [[cycling]] event modeled on the [[Tour de France]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

====2012====
{{main|United States House of Representatives elections in Missouri, 2012#District 3}}
Missouri was reduced to eight districts after the 2010 U.S. Census determined that the state's population growth was slower than that of the national average. Luetkemeyer's district was renumbered as the 3rd Congressional District. It lost most of its northern portion to the newly drawn [[Missouri's 6th congressional district|6th Congressional District]]. To make up for the loss of population, it was pushed slightly to the west, gaining all of Jefferson City. Luetkemeyer already represented the share of the capital located in [[Callaway County, Missouri|Callaway County]], but picked up [[Cole County, Missouri|Cole County]] in the redistricting process.

Luetkemeyer easily won the general election in his first run in the newly created district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://enr.sos.mo.gov/ENR/Views/TabularData.aspx?TabView=StateRaces^Federal%20/%20Statewide%20Races^011656688155|title=Election Results U.S. House 3rd District|publisher=Missouri Secretary of State website|date=7 November 2012|accessdate=8 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121115072604/http://enr.sos.mo.gov/ENR/Views/TabularData.aspx?TabView=StateRaces%5EFederal+%2F+Statewide+Races%5E011656688155|archivedate=15 November 2012|df=}}</ref>
