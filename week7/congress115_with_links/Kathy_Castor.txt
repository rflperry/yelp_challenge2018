==Political campaigns==

Castor won the September 5, 2006 Democratic primary—the real contest in what has long been the only safe Democratic district on Florida's Gulf Coast—defeating challengers Al Fox, Lesley "Les" Miller, Scott Farrell, and Michael Steinberg. She received 54% of the vote, a full 20 points ahead of state Senate Minority Leader Les Miller in the five-way race.

Eddie Adams Jr., an architect and former hospital laboratory technologist,<ref>{{cite web|title=Homepage|url=http://adamsforcongress.org/|publisher=Eddie Adams, Jr. for U.S. Congress|accessdate=April 19, 2014}}</ref> was the only [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] to file.  Castor was endorsed by the pro-choice political action committee [[EMILY's List]], the League of Conservation Voters, Oceans Champions, The Tampa Tribune, The St. Petersburg Times and The Bradenton Herald.

Castor handily won the 2006 November general election, 70% to 30%--becoming the first woman to represent the Tampa Bay area in Congress, as well as only the third representative of this Tampa-based district since its creation in 1963 (it was the 10th District from 1963–67, the 6th from 1967–73, the 7th from 1973–93, the 11th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 14th since 2013).

===2008===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 11}}
Castor was reelected in November 2008 71% to 29% in a rematch with Adams.

===2010===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 11}}
Castor was challenged by Republican nominee Mike Prendergast, a career military officer who retired in 2008 as a [[Colonel]] in the [[United States Army]]. Castor was reelected in November 2010 with 60% of the vote to Prendergast's 40%. Though Castor won convincingly, it was still the best showing for a Republican in this district since 1994.

=== 2012 ===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 14}}
After the 2010 census, Florida gained two more congressional seats. As a result, Castor's district was renumbered as the 14th. It was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Castor won reelection with 70.2 percent of the vote over Republican E. J. Otero.

=== 2014 ===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2014#District 14}}
No candidates filed to oppose Castor in the 2014 election.

=== 2016 ===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2016#District 14}}

However, it was no less Democratic than its predecessor, and Castor held her seat against Quinn, with 61.79% of the vote to Quinn's 38.21%.
