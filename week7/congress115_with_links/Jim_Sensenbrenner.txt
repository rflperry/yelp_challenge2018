He is the former chairman of the [[United States House Committee on Science|House Science Committee]] and the former chairman of the [[United States House Committee on the Judiciary|House Judiciary Committee]]; when the Republicans lost control of the House, he finished his six-year term as chairman, and was not chosen as the Judiciary Committee's ranking minority member (that honor went to [[Lamar S. Smith]] of [[Texas]]).<ref>[http://judiciary.house.gov/CommitteeMembership.aspx judiciary.house.gov]</ref> He served as the ranking Republican on the [[United States House Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming|House Select Committee for Energy Independence and Global Warming]] from 2007 to 2011, when Republicans abolished the committee after regaining control of the House.

When 9th District Congressman [[Bob Kasten]] vacated his seat to run for governor in 1978, Sensenbrenner ran in the election to succeed him, defeating his primary opponent, [[Susan Engeleiter]], by 589 votes with a plurality of 43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=387741 |title=WI District 9 – R Primary Race – Sep 12, 1978 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref><ref name="Legal Times">Goldman, T.R., [http://www.law.com/jsp/dc/PubArticleDC.jsp?id=1114851905519 "The Man With The Iron Gavel"], ''Legal Times'' May 2, 2005</ref> He defeated Democratic lawyer [[Matt Flynn (politician)|Matt Flynn]] in November 1978 with 61%,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=53770 |title=WI District 9 Race – Nov 07, 1978 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> and has been reelected 16 more times with no substantive opposition, sometimes running unopposed. His district was renumbered as the 5th after the 2000 census, when Wisconsin lost a district. He has never won re-election with less than 62% of the vote. In fact, his worst two re-elections were in 2004, when he defeated [[UW-Milwaukee]] professor Bryan Kennedy with 67% of the vote,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=4415 |title=WI – District 05 Race – Nov 02, 2004 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref> and in 2006 defeated him in a rematch with 62%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=207759 |title=WI – District 05 Race – Nov 07, 2006 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2012-11-09}}</ref>

In the 2016 election, he defeated Democratic nominee Khary Pennebaker.<ref>https://ballotpedia.org/Khary_Penebaker</ref>

===Impeachment of Bill Clinton===
In 1998, Sensenbrenner was one of the acting [[House manager]]s in the [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeachment]] of [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Bill Clinton]].{{citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Security ===
Sensenbrenner introduced the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] to the House on October 23, 2001. Although the primary author was [[United States Assistant Attorney General|Assistant Attorney General of the United States]] [[Viet Dinh]],{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Sensenbrenner has been recognized as "one of the architects of the Patriot Act".<ref>Jennifer Granick and Christopher Sprigman, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/opinion/the-criminal-nsa.html?pagewanted=all&_r=1& The Criminal N.S.A.]", ''[[The New York Times]]'', June 27, 2013.</ref>  In November 2004, Sensenbrenner and California Congressman [[Duncan Hunter]] objected to provisions of a bill that created a [[United States Director of National Intelligence|Director of National Intelligence]], a key recommendation of the [[National Commission on Terrorist Attacks Upon the United States]], known as the [[9/11]] Commission. In 2006, the NRA successfully lobbied Sensenbrenner to add a provision to the Patriot Act re-authorization that requires Senate confirmation of ATF director nominees.<ref name=Horwitz130731>{{cite news |last=Horwitz |first=Sari |date=2013-07-31 |title=Senate confirms ATF director |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/senate-confirms-atf-director/2013/07/31/dc9b0644-fa09-11e2-8752-b41d7ed1f685_story.html |newspaper=Washington Post |accessdate=2014-06-10}}</ref>

In 2005, Sensenbrenner authored the [[Real ID Act]], which requires scrutiny of citizenship before issuing [[Driver's license#United States and Canada|drivers' licenses]] to make it more difficult for terrorists and criminals to alter their identities by counterfeiting documents. He attached the controversial act as a rider on military spending bill HR418, which was passed by the Senate without debate.<ref>Barrett, Ted. [[CNN]] [http://www.cnn.com/2005/POLITICS/05/03/congress.war.spending/ "House, Senate agree on $82 billion war spending bill"].</ref>

On June 17, 2005, Sensenbrenner, the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, ended a meeting where Republicans and Democrats were debating the renewal of the USA PATRIOT Act and walked out in response to Democratic members discussing [[human rights]] violations at the [[Guantanamo Bay detainment camp]] and the ongoing [[Iraq War]]. He ordered the court reporter to halt transcription of the proceedings and [[C-SPAN]] to shut off its cameras. Sensenbrenner defended his actions by stating that the Democrats and witnesses had violated House rules in discussing issues unrelated to the subject of the meeting.<ref>[[United States House Committee on the Judiciary]] press release [http://judiciary.house.gov/media/pdfs/NadlerresolutionFJSfloorstate61605.pdf "Sensenbrenner Floor Statement Regarding Question of Personal Privilege"], June 16, 2005</ref> Democrats have claimed that his walkout was contrary to House [[parliamentary procedure]], which is to adjourn either on motion or without objection.<ref name="Idiots in Charge">{{cite book|last1=Gregory|first1=Leland|title=Idiots in Charge: Lies, Trick, Misdeeds, and Other Political Untruthiness|date=2009|publisher=Andrews McMeel Publishing|isbn=0740792083|page=265}}</ref>

In June 2013, Sensenbrenner objected to the [[FBI]] and [[NSA]]'s use of the PATRIOT Act to routinely collect phone metadata from millions of Americans without any suspicion of wrongdoing. He said: <blockquote>The Bureau's broad application for phone records was made under the so-called business records provision of the Act. I do not believe the broadly drafted FISA order is consistent with the requirements of the Patriot Act. Seizing phone records of millions of innocent people is excessive and un-American.<ref name="nsa-database">{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/hillicon-valley/technology/303937-patriot-act-author-extremely-troubled-by-nsa-phone-tracking|title=Patriot Act author ‘extremely troubled’ by NSA phone tracking|publisher=The Hill|date=June 6, 2013|first=Justin|last=Sink}}</ref> </blockquote>He released a statement saying: "While I believe the Patriot Act appropriately balanced national security concerns and civil rights, I have always worried about potential abuses."<ref name="nyt-prism">{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/opinion/president-obamas-dragnet.html?src=me&ref=general&pagewanted=all|title=President Obama’s Dragnet |date=6 June 2013| accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="sense_state">{{cite web| url=http://sensenbrenner.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=337001|title=Author of Patriot Act: FBI’s FISA Order is Abuse of Patriot Act|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref>

He also criticized the [[PRISM (surveillance program)|PRISM]] program, stating that the Patriot Act did not authorize the program.<ref name="mil_journal">{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/210884931.html|title=Sensenbrenner sees lawsuits stemming from surveillance|date=6 June 2013|accessdate=6 June 2013}}</ref><ref name="guard_sense">{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/09/abuse-patriot-act-must-end|title=This abuse of the Patriot Act must end|date=9 June 2013|accessdate=11 June 2013}}</ref>

Sensenbrenner supported the [[Amash–Conyers Amendment]], a plan to defund the NSA's telephone surveillance program. "Never, he said, did he intend to allow the wholesale vacuuming up of domestic phone records, nor did his legislation envision that data dragnets would go beyond specific targets of terrorism investigations." The Amendment fell seven votes short of the number it needed to pass.<ref>{{Cite news | last =Weisman | first =Jonathan | title =Momentum Builds Against N.S.A.

In October 2013, he introduced the [[USA Freedom Act]] in the House, a bill designed to curtail the powers of the NSA and end the NSA's dragnet phone data collection program. The bill is supported by civil liberties advocacy groups, including the [[American Civil Liberties Union]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/oct/29/nsa-surveillance-review-intelligence-chiefs-testify |title=NSA faces sweeping surveillance review as intelligence chiefs face hostile house |publisher=TheGuardian.Com |date=2013-10-29 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}</ref>

===Terri Schiavo case===

=== Immigration ===
Sensenbrenner was the main sponsor of [[H.R. 4437]], a bill passed by the House in 2005 that would provide additional criminal penalties for aiding and abetting [[illegal immigration to the United States]].<ref>[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h109-4437 "H.R. 4437: Border Protection, Antiterrorism, and Illegal Immigration Control Act of 2005"], GovTrack.us</ref> Sensenbrenner, in spite of unanimous Congressional support,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/nov/16/congress-moves-to-revise-law-to-help-et-marines/|title=Congress moves to revise law to help ET Marine's widow|author=Michael Collins|work=KNS|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> attempted to delay a bill<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/dec/09/ferschke-bill-halted-again/|title=Ferschke bill halted again|author=Michael Collins|work=KNS|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> in December 2010 that would have been benefited Hotaru Ferschke, the Japanese-born widow of a United States Marine killed in combat. Congressman [[John Duncan, Jr.|John Duncan]] was able to use "a loophole" to get the bill passed in spite of Sensenbrenner's objections. By adding language in the Senate indicating the bill would not impact the federal budget Sensenbrenner could no longer block the bill by himself according to House rules. The measure was passed unanimously.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.knoxnews.com/news/2010/dec/15/house-may-vote-today-residency-maryville-marine/|title=House unanimously OKs residency for widow of Maryville Marine|author=Michael Collins|work=KNS|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref>

(Vote On Passage)"], GovTrack.us</ref> The bill passed and was signed into law by President [[George W. Bush]].

=== Intellectual property ===
On December 16, 2005, Sensenbrenner introduced the [[Digital Transition Content Security Act]].

=== Separation of powers ===
In 2006, Sensenbrenner expressed outrage at the [[FBI]] raid of the congressional office of Democratic Representative [[William J. Jefferson]], asserting constitutional concerns over [[separation of powers]]. He held Judiciary Committee hearings in May 2006 on this issue.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}. One year before, on May 9, 2005, he suggested the creation of an "inspector general" on the federal Judiciary.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Buonomo|first1=Giampiero|title =Scontro politica-giustizia modello Usa: tutte le spine della Corte suprema nel mirino dei parlamentari|journal= Diritto&Giustizia edizione online |date=2005| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89395247}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}</ref>

=== Animal rights ===
In fall 2006, the Animal Fighting Prohibition Enforcement Act unanimously passed the Senate, but Sensenbrenner used his position to block final House consideration of the legislation, even though the bill had 324 co-sponsors. The act creates [[felony]]-level penalties for [[animal fighting]] activities.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

=== Foreign relations ===
Sensenbrenner was the only Republican to join House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]]'s Congressional delegation to meet the [[Dalai Lama]] in [[Dharamsala, Himachal Pradesh|Dharamsala]], [[India]] during the March 2008 [[2008 unrest in Tibet|protests against China]] by [[Tibet]]ans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/leading-the-news/pelosi-offers-support-for-tibet-in-meeting-with-dalai-lama-2008-03-21.html|title=News Archive|work=TheHill|accessdate=25 January 2015}}</ref> While there he said, "In the US Congress, there is no division between Democrats and Republicans on the issue of protecting Tibetan culture and eliminating repression against Tibetans around the world."<ref>[http://english.aljazeera.net/NR/exeres/D417F1C0-AC84-4560-AF36-7E3AA81C2478.htm Pelosi urges world to condemn China]</ref>

Following the death of [[Nelson Mandela]], Sensenbrenner objected to the executive proclamation by President [[Barack Obama]] to lower the flags to half-staff to honor Mandela. He stated it was his belief that the American flag should only be flown at half-staff for Americans.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/235420511.html|publisher=Journal Sentinel, Inc|last=Bice|first=Daniel|title=Rep.

=== Comment about Michelle Obama ===
In December 2011, the ''[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel]]'' reported Sensenbrenner referred to [[First Lady of the United States|First Lady]] [[Michelle Obama]]'s "big butt" while talking to church members at a [[Christmas bazaar]] at St. Aidan's church in [[Hartford, Wisconsin|Hartford]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Bice|first=Daniel|title=Sensenbrenner apologizes to first lady over "big butt" remark|url=http://www.jsonline.com/blogs/news/136060223.html|work=No Quarter Blog|publisher=Milwaukee Wisconsin Journal Sentinel Online|accessdate=December 23, 2011}}</ref> Church member Ann Marsh-Meigs told the newspaper that she heard Sensenbrenner's remarks. She said the congressman was speaking about the first lady's efforts to combat childhood obesity, and added, "And look at her big butt." On December 22, Sensenbrenner's press secretary said Sensenbrenner had sent Obama a personal note and released a statement saying he regretted his "inappropriate comment".
