'''Christopher Van Hollen Jr.''' (born January 10, 1959) is an American politician serving as the [[Seniority in the United States Senate|junior]] [[United States Senate|United States Senator]] from [[Maryland]] since January 3, 2017. From 2003 to 2017, he held the position of [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|8|}}. He is a member of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party]].

In 2006, Van Hollen became the chair of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]] (DCCC). In this post, he was responsible for leading efforts to defend vulnerable Democrats and get more Democrats elected to Congress in 2008, which he did. House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] created a new leadership post, Assistant to the Speaker, in 2006 so that Van Hollen could be present at all leadership meetings. He was elected Ranking Member on the Budget Committee on November 17, 2010. Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to the 12-member bipartisan [[United States Congress Joint Select Committee on Deficit Reduction|Committee on Deficit Reduction]] with a mandate for finding major budget reductions by late 2011. On October 17, 2013 Pelosi appointed Van Hollen to serve on the bicameral conference committee.<ref>{{cite web|title=Pelosi Names Conferees to FY 2014 Budget Conference|url=http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|website=www.democraticleader.gov|accessdate=July 4, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704022207/http://www.democraticleader.gov/Pelosi_Statement_on_Conferess_to_FY_2014_Budget_Conference|archive-date=July 4, 2014}}</ref>

Van Hollen ran for the [[United States Senate]] in [[United States Senate election in Maryland, 2016|2016]] to replace retiring Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] and won the general election 60 to 36 percent. Van Hollen serves as Chair of the [[Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee]] (DSCC) for the [[United States Senate elections, 2018|2018 elections]] cycle.<ref name="krobillard1">{{cite news|last1=Robillard|first1=Kevin|last2=Schor|first2=Elena|title=Van Hollen to serve as DSCC chair|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/chris-van-hollen-dscc-chair-231621|accessdate=November 18, 2016|publisher=Politico}}</ref>

==Maryland State Legislature==
Van Hollen served in the [[Maryland General Assembly]] from 1991 to 2003, first in the [[Maryland House of Delegates|House of Delegates]] (1991–95) and then in the [[Maryland State Senate|State Senate]] (1995–2003).<ref name=directory/> In the Senate, he served on the Budget and Taxation Committee and the Health and Human Services Subcommittee.

Maryland's 8th district hugs the northern border of Washington, D.C., and is one of the wealthiest and most educated congressional districts in the nation. The federal government is the single largest employer in the district, and many private companies are funded by the government.<ref name="apsanet.org">{{cite web|url=http://www.apsanet.org/imgtest/PSJul03Abbe.pdf|title=American Political Science Association election review|format=PDF|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

He introduced an amendment, which passed, that repealed a 9.5 percent loophole in [[student loan]]s that had allowed lenders to pocket billions of taxpayer dollars.

Because many federal employees live in his district, Van Hollen has worked on a number of issues relating to them. He supported pay parity in pay raises for civilian employees and introduced an amendment, which passed, to block attempts to [[Outsourcing|outsource]] federal jobs.<ref>{{cite web|last=Mosquera|first=Mary|url=http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/23456-1.html|title=House votes against revised A-76 rules|publisher=GCN|date=September 10, 2003|accessdate=August 31, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930153903/http://www.gcn.com/online/vol1_no1/23456-1.html|archivedate=September 30, 2007|df=}}</ref>

[[File:Chris Van Hollen official portrait, 2010.jpg|thumb|right|240px|Official portrait as a U.S. Representative, 2010]]
Van Hollen has secured federal funding for a number of local-interest projects, including transportation initiatives, local [[homeland security]] efforts, education programs and community development projects. He and [[Adam Schiff]] (D-CA) often discuss issues of National Security on the floor of the House in tandem, with particular commentary on the wars in [[Afghanistan]] and [[Iraq]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.house.gov/apps/list/speech/md08_vanhollen/Real_Security_9_19.html|title=Transcript of Congress speech on national security|publisher=House.gov|date=September 19, 2006|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>

In May 2006, Van Hollen formed a [[congressional caucus]] on the [[Netherlands]] with Dutch-born Republican U.S. Representative [[Pete Hoekstra]] from [[Michigan]]. The goal of the caucus is to promote the U.S. relationship with the Netherlands and remember the Dutch role in establishing the [[New York (state)|State of New York]] and the [[United States]].{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In July 2006, Van Hollen urged the [[George W. Bush administration|Bush administration]] to support a ceasefire supported by a peacekeeping force that would end the [[2006 Lebanon War]].

In 2006, Van Hollen opted out of the race to succeed the retiring Senator [[Paul Sarbanes]], saying he would rather spend time with his family and help elect more Democrats to Congress.<ref>{{cite web|last=Craig|first=Tim|last2=Wagner|first2=John|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2005/07/11/AR2005071101496.html|title=Van Hollen says he won't run for Senate|publisher=The Washington Post|date=July 12, 2005|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref> In keeping with that, Van Hollen was appointed to Chairman of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]].

In 2009, Van Hollen introduced a bill which establishes a [[green bank]] to catalyze the financing of [[clean energy]] and [[Efficient energy use|energy efficiency]] projects.<ref>[http://www.newenergyworldnetwork.com/renewable-energy-news/by_technology/energy_efficiency/the-coalition-for-green-bank-applauds-congressman-chris-van-hollens-green-bank-act.html Coalition for Green Bank applauds US Congressman Chris Van Hollen's Green Bank Act], newenergyworldnetwork.com, March 25, 2009.</ref> He reintroduced the same bill again in 2014.<ref>{{cite web|title=House Democrats Introduce the Green Bank Act of 2014|url=http://vanhollen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-democrats-introduce-the-green-bank-act-of-2014|website=vanhollen.house.gov|accessdate=July 4, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140628191826/http://vanhollen.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/house-democrats-introduce-the-green-bank-act-of-2014|archivedate=June 28, 2014}}</ref>

In March 2010, when [[Charles Rangel]] was forced to resign as Chairman of the Committee on Ways and Means over ethics charges, Van Hollen played a key role in having [[Sander Levin]] succeed to the Chairmanship over [[Pete Stark]]. Stark was the second-most experienced member of the committee while Levin was third, and party tradition would have made Stark chairman due to seniority. However, Van Hollen and other younger members saw Stark's past intemperate comments as a liability to the Democrats in an election year.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/03/04/AR2010030402174.html?hpid=topnews | work=The Washington Post | first=Paul | last=Kane | title=Michigan's Sander Levin replaces Rangel as House Ways and Means chairman | date=March 5, 2010}}</ref>

In April 2011, Van Hollen sued the [[Federal Election Commission]], charging it with [[regulatory capture]] and the creation of a loophole that allowed unlimited and undisclosed financing in the 2010 election reason. According to Van Hollen, had it not been for the loophole, "much of the more than $135 million in secret contributions that funded expenditures would have been disclosed."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/fundraising/157195-top-democrat-sues-federal-election-commission-over-anonymous-donors|title=Top Democrat sues Federal Election Commission over anonymous donors|publisher=The Hill|date=April 21, 2011|accessdate=August 31, 2012}}</ref>{{update inline|date=August 2017|reason=What activity followed this lawsuit, now more than 6 years ago?}}

==Political campaigns==
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010}}
Prior to Van Hollen's election, incumbent [[Connie Morella]] had won eight elections in the district, despite the fact that she was a Republican in a district that had swung heavily Democratic. Morella's success was largely attributed to her political independence and relatively [[Liberalism|liberal]] voting record, including support for [[abortion rights]], [[gay rights]], [[gun control]] and increased [[Environmentalism|environmental protections]].

After Morella's reelection in 2000, Democratic [[Maryland Senate]] President [[Thomas V. Miller, Jr.]] made no secret that he wanted to draw the 8th out from under Morella. Indeed, one [[redistricting]] plan after the 2000 U.S. Census went so far as to divide the 8th in two, giving one district to Van Hollen and forcing Morella to run against popular State Delegate [[Mark Kennedy Shriver]] in November. The final plan was far less ambitious, but made the district even more Democratic than its predecessor.  It absorbed nine heavily Democratic precincts from neighboring [[Prince George's County]], an area that Morella had never represented. It also restored a heavily Democratic spur in eastern Montgomery County that had been cut out in the last round of redistricting.

In 2002, Van Hollen entered a competitive Democratic primary against Shriver and former [[Presidency of Bill Clinton|Clinton Administration]] aide Ira Shapiro. Though Shriver had the most money, Van Hollen launched a very successful grassroots effort that mobilized Democratic voters. After receiving the endorsement of ''[[The Washington Post]]'', ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', and other local papers, Van Hollen defeated Shriver 43.5 percent to 40.6 percent.

During the campaign, Van Hollen emphasized that even when Morella voted with the district, her partisan affiliation kept [[Tom DeLay]] and the rest of her party's more conservative leadership in power. Van Hollen also touted his leadership in the State Senate on issues such as education funding, [[HMO]] reform, [[trigger lock]]s for handguns, and protecting the [[Chesapeake Bay]] from [[oil drilling]]. Ultimately, after a tight race, Van Hollen defeated Morella 51.7 percent to 48.2 percent.<ref name="apsanet.org"/>  Van Hollen crushed Morella in the Prince George's County portion of the district, while narrowly winning Montgomery County.  However, Morella won most of the precincts she'd previously represented.

Proving just how Democratic this district was, Van Hollen was reelected four times from this district by over 70 percent of the vote.  However, it had long been taken for granted that the Republicans would face extremely long odds of retaking the seat if Morella retired or was defeated in an election.

After the 2010 census, Van Hollen's district was made slightly less Democratic.  He lost a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County to the neighboring [[Maryland's 6th congressional district|6th district]], and lost his share of Prince George's County to the [[Maryland's 4th congressional district|4th district]].  In their place, the 8th absorbed heavily Republican Carroll County and a strongly Republican spur of Frederick County.  Nonetheless, since his share of Montgomery County has more than double the population of his shares of Carroll and Frederick counties combined, Van Hollen easily won a sixth term over Republican Ken Timmerman with 63 percent of the vote.  While Van Hollen lost in Carroll and Frederick, he swamped Timmerman in Montgomery by 113,500 votes.
