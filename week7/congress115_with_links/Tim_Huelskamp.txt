==Early life, education, and career==
Huelskamp was born on November 11, 1968 and raised on the Huelskamp family farm in [[Fowler, Kansas]]. Pioneered by his grandparents Martin and Clara in 1926, the farm operation includes raising corn, cattle, wheat, milo, and soybeans. He attended elementary and high school in Fowler, where he was a Farm Bureau Youth Leader, a member of St. Anthony's Parish, and active in both 4-H and Future Farmers of America.

After attending seminary for two years in Santa Fe, Huelskamp continued his education at the College of Santa Fe (now [[Santa Fe University of Art and Design]]) and received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in social science education in 1991. He received his [[Ph.D.]] in political science, concentrating in agricultural policy from the [[American University]] in 1995.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.votesmart.org/bio.php?can_id=12571|title=Tim Huelskamp's Biography – The Voter's Self Defense System – Vote Smart|work=Project Vote Smart|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref><ref name=AP01>{{cite news |url=http://www.cjonline.com/stories/031598/kan_phd.shtml |title=Unassuming Ph.D. is emerging |last=Hanna |first=John |date=March 15, 1998 |agency=Associated Press |publisher=''[[The Topeka Capital-Journal]]'' |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas, 2010#District 1}}
Seven-term Congressman [[Jerry Moran]] gave up the Big First seat to make a successful run for the [[United States Senate]] seat being vacated by the popular fourteen-year incumbent Republican [[Sam Brownback]], who was [[Kansas gubernatorial election, 2010|running for governor that year]]. This touched off a free-for-all in the Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Huelskamp finished first in the six-candidate primary field with 34.8 percent of the vote, all but assuring that he would be the district's next representative.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=511123|title=Our Campaigns – KS District 1 – R Primary Race – Aug 03, 2010|work=ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=September 25, 2015}}</ref>

Huelskamp ran against Democratic nominee [[Alan Jilka]] and Libertarian nominee Jack W. Warner. Huelskamp was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]], [[Mike Huckabee]],<ref>{{cite web |url=http://primebuzz.kcstar.com/?q=node/17211 |title=Huckabee endorses Huelskamp's Congressional bid |last=Klepper |first=David |date=February 17, 2009 |work=[[The Kansas City Star]] |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://briefingroom.thehill.com/tag/tim-huelskamp/ |title=Huelskamp Picks up Huckabee Endorsement |last=Jacobs |first=Jeremy P. |date=February 17, 2009 |work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |accessdate=February 28, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317024251/http://briefingroom.thehill.com/tag/tim-huelskamp/ |archivedate=March 17, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}</ref> [[Conservative Leadership PAC]], [[Concerned Women for America]] Legislative Action Committee,<ref name=KSA01/> Ron Paul and [[Ken Blackwell]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.kansasliberty.com/liberty-update-archive/2009/09feb/sen-huelskamp-files-bill-that-would-require-school-districts-to-post-financial-information-on-state-website/ |title=Huelskamp bill pushes for school district spending transparency |last=LaCerte |first=Phil |date=February 5, 2009 |work=Kansas Liberty |accessdate=February 28, 2009}}</ref>

Unlike the previous election, Huelskamp was challenged by a Republican, [[Alan LaPolice]], in the primary.<ref name = OpenSecrets>{{cite web| url =https://www.opensecrets.org/races/election.php?state=KS| title = Congressional Races in 2014 (Kansas) | publisher = [[The Center for Responsive Politics]]| accessdate = July 15, 2014}}</ref> Moreover, two Democrats ran for the primary [[Jim Sherow]], a [[Kansas State University]] professor, and Bryan Whitney, a 2013 [[Wichita State University]] grad. Both LaPolice and Sherow critiqued Huelskamp for his failure to work with other Members of Congress and voting against Farm Bill.<ref name=GOPChal>{{cite news|title=Huelskamp faces GOP challenge in Kan. 1st District|first=Roxana|last=Hegeman|publisher=Associated Press|date=July 5, 2014|url=http://www.kansas.com/2014/07/05/3540423/huelskamp-faces-gop-challenge.html|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140712013016/http://www.kansas.com/2014/07/05/3540423/huelskamp-faces-gop-challenge.html|archivedate=July 12, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref><ref name=gctelegram>{{cite news| title = Sherow makes bid for 'good representation' in Big First| url = http://gctelegram.com/news/local/Sherow-Congress-3-20-14| date = 2014-03-19| first = Scott| last = Aust| newspaper = Garden City Telegram| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20140609193131/http://gctelegram.com/news/local/Sherow-Congress-3-20-14| archivedate = June 9, 2014| df = mdy-all}}</ref> Huelskamp narrowly defeated LaPolice in the Republican Primary with only 55% of the vote. Huelskamp failed to receive the endorsement of the Farm Bureau and the Kansas Livestock Association. Huelskamp went on to win the general election with 68% of the vote.<ref name = OpenSecrets/>

;2016
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Kansas, 2016#District 1}}
Huelskamp was defeated in the Republican primary by [[Roger Marshall (politician)|Roger Marshall]], an obstetrician from [[Great Bend, Kansas|Great Bend]],<ref>{{cite news|title=Tea party's Tim Huelskamp ousted by challenger Roger Marshall in Kansas congressional race|url=http://www.kansascity.com/news/politics-government/election/article93390117.html|accessdate=August 3, 2016|publisher=Kansas City Star}}</ref> by 58% to 42%. Marshall's supporters argued Huelskamp's combativeness hurt the district. House leadership had removed Huelskamp from the House Agriculture Committee in 2012; farm groups such as Kansas Farm Bureau, an affiliate of the [[American Farm Bureau Federation]], Kansas Livestock Association, an affiliate of the [[National Cattlemen's Beef Association]], [[National Association of Wheat Growers]] and the [[United States Chamber of Commerce|US Chamber of Commerce]] endorsed Marshall, as many Republican voters saw it as a crucial issue in a farm state.<ref>{{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 2, 2016 |title=Physician Marshall ousts US Rep.

===Legislative activity===
In early 2012, Huelskamp introduced legislation that would ensure military chaplains could not be "directed, ordered or required to perform any duty, rite, ritual, ceremony, service or function that is contrary to the conscience, moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain, or contrary to the moral principles or religious beliefs of the chaplain's faith group." The language appeared to be related to permitting same-sex marriages on military bases in states where such unions are permitted.<ref>Hoskinson, Charles, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72325.html "Don't Ask Don't Tell: War over gays in military in new phase"], ''Politico'', February 1, 2012.</ref>

===Sovereign debt crisis===
On February 16, 2012, during a contentious three-hour [[United States House Committee on the Budget|House Budget Committee]] hearing with [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]], Huelskamp warned of the looming threat of an economic crisis similar to the one then [[European sovereign debt crisis|taking place in Europe]]. Huelskamp accused Geithner and the entire Obama administration of failing to correct the U.S.'s debt crisis, which he believed would lead the country down the same path. Geithner replied that Huelskamp had an "adolescent perspective on how to think about economic policy."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/republicans-warn-of-european-style-debt-crisis-2012-02-16?dist=afterbell |title=House Republicans warn of European-style debt crisis |last=Robb |first=Greg |date=February 16, 2012 |work=MarketWatch |accessdate=February 17, 2012}}</ref>

"The idea that Jesus Christ himself was degrading and demeaning is what they've come down to," he said. "I can't even stand to read the decisions because I don't even think they'd pass law school with decisions like that."<ref>[http://www.rightwingwatch.org/content/huelskamp-doma-ruling-attack-jesus-christ-justices-couldnt-pass-law-school#sthash.CRRatOg9.dpuf Huelskamp: DOMA Ruling an Attack on Jesus Christ; Justices Couldn't Pass Law School] Right Wing Watch – June 28, 2013</ref>

The House Republican Steering Committee removed Huelskamp from both the Budget Committee and the Agriculture Committee in late 2012 as part of a larger party leadership-caucus shift.<ref>Wing, Nick, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/12/tim-huelskamp-john-boehner_n_2285196.html  "Tim Huelskamp: John Boehner Guilty Of 'Petty, Vindictive Politics' In Committee Ousters"], ''The Huffington Post'', 12/12/2012.</ref> At a [[Heritage Foundation]] lunch in the immediate wake of the removal, Huelskamp said: "It's petty, it's vindictive, and if you have any conservative principles you will be punished for articulating those."<ref name=WP01>Weiner, Rachel, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2012/12/05/conservatives-bite-back-at-gop-leadership-over-purge/ "Conservatives bite back over House GOP purge"], Washington ''Post'' Post Politics blog, December 5, 2012.

''[[Politico]]'' quoted a spokesperson for Republican Congressman [[Lynn Westmoreland]] of Georgia as explaining that Huelskamp, Amash and Schweikert were removed for "their inability to work with other members." The spokesperson clarified that Westmoreland "said that it had nothing to do with their voting record, a scorecard, or their actions across the street [meaning fundraising]." The three were described by ''Politico'' and its sourcing of Huelskamp's other colleagues as "jerks" who "made life harder for other Republicans by taking whacks at them in public for supporting the team".<ref name="The a—hole factor">{{ cite news | last=Allen |first=Jonathan | url=http://www.politico.com/story/2012/12/house-leaders-make-examples-of-obstinate-members-85034.html | title='The a—hole factor' | publisher=Politico | date=December 13, 2012 | accessdate=May 8, 2014}}</ref><ref name="'Obstinate' Factor Continues to Roil GOP">{{cite news |url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/obstinate_factor_continues_to_roil_gop-219926-1.html|title='Obstinate' Factor Continues to Roil GOP|date=December 12, 2012|accessdate=April 30, 2014 |publisher=Roll Call}}</ref>{{rp|p.2}}

On January 3, 2013, Huelskamp appeared to be counting votes as part of an effort to unseat [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] [[John Boehner]] when the [[113th Congress#Major events|113th Congress]] convened. Huelskamp nominated conservative [[Jim Jordan (Ohio politician)|Jim Jordan]] to replace Boehner. When asked about the anti-Boehner effort, a spokesman for Huelskamp declined to comment.<ref>Sherman, Jake, and John Bresnahan (January 3, 2013), [http://www.politico.com/story/2013/01/conservatives-rebel-against-boehner-85749.html "Conservatives rebel against Boehner"], ''[[Politico]]'.'</ref>
