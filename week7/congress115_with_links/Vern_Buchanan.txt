'''Vernon Gale Buchanan''' (born May 8, 1951) is a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]]. He has represented [[Florida's 16th congressional district]] since 2007. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]. Rep. Buchanan is the only member from Florida on the House [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|Ways and Means Committee]], which has jurisdiction over tax policy, international trade, health care, and Social Security. Prior to serving in Congress, Buchanan was in business for over 30 years and was the chairman of both the Greater Sarasota Chamber of Commerce and the [[Florida Chamber of Commerce]]. He served as member of the board and the executive committee of the [[United States Chamber of Commerce]].

==Early life and education==
Buchanan grew up in Inkster, Michigan, a small town outside [[Detroit]], [[Michigan]], the son of a factory foreman in a family of six children.<ref name="HT-10-31-06">Lauren Mayk, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061030/NEWS/610300366 "Buchanan: Big deals led to big riches"], ''Herald-Tribune'', October 31, 2006</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Vern Buchanan Biography|url=http://buchanan.house.gov/biography/|website=Vern Buchanan Congress|accessdate=December 2, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205233446/http://buchanan.house.gov/biography/|archive-date=December 5, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref> His maternal grandparents immigrated to the United States from [[Finland]].<ref>http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~battle/reps/buchanan.htm</ref> When he graduated from high school in 1969, he joined the [[Michigan Air National Guard]], serving there for six years. Buchanan got a bachelor's degree in Business Administration from [[Cleary University]], in Michigan, and a Masters in Business Administration from the [[University of Detroit]].

==Business career==
In June 2007, Buchanan, in his financial disclosure filing, reported having over $100 million in assets, making him among the five wealthiest members of Congress. Most of his wealth is from his automotive empire, which includes several dealerships in Florida. He also reported ownership interests in about fifty other businesses, including offshore reinsurance companies, and a charter-jet business. He reported receiving at least $19.5 million in income from these businesses in 2006.<ref>Duane Marsteller, [http://www.bradenton.com/280/story/75977.html "One of richest reps in Congress: Vern Buchanan"]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, Bradenton Herald'', June 16, 2007</ref>

===American Speedy Printing===
In May 1976, Buchanan convinced the owner of a Michigan printing company that he could help the business grow. The two founded American Speedy Printing, which grew through franchising to more than 730 stores in 44 states. Later, Buchanan and American Speedy Printing were defendants in a string of lawsuits during the late 1980s and early 1990s by franchisees and master franchisees, who said they were not making the money that Buchanan had said they could expect. After filing for bankruptcy, he was accused by a creditors committee of taking excessive compensation and actions that resulted in overstated earnings for American Speedy Printing. In a 1995 deposition, he said that he had no personal obligation to repay a large corporate loan from Merrill Lynch. A dispute with the Internal Revenue Service over taxes on the money Buchanan received from Merrill Lynch stretched through the 1990s. Buchanan, his business partner, and Merrill Lynch were sued for violating the Michigan Corporation Act. It ended with Buchanan paying $1.5 million.<ref name="HT-10-6-06">Lauren Mayk, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20051006%2FBUSINESS%2F510060664%2F-1%2FAUTOS&template=printart "A success story that's not so simple: Vern Buchanan's messy departure from American Speedy is a seldom-told tale"], ''Herald Tribune'', October 6, 2006</ref>

===Car dealerships===
In 1992, Buchanan bought a Honda and Acura dealership in [[Ocala, Florida]]. In late 1999, he bought two more dealerships. He continued to acquire dealerships after that, but in 2006 he sold five dealerships and other businesses in order to concentrate on politics.<ref name="HT-10-31-06"/> His dealerships had $756 million in sales in 2005.<ref name="HT-10-6-06"/> His Venice Dodge was one of the dealerships informed by Chrysler that it would not get its franchise renewed.<ref name="myref33">{{Cite web|url=http://msnbcmedia.msn.com/i/msnbc/sections/business/Chrysler_dealers_list.pdf|title=Exhibit A|accessdate=May 16, 2009|publisher=MSNBC|date=May 14, 2009|author=LLC, Chrysler|format=PDF}}</ref>

===Reinsurance companies===
Buchanan owns two [[reinsurance]] companies — Jamat Reinsurance Co. and Buchanan Reinsurance Co., in [[Turks and Caicos]], and part of the [[Bermuda]] reinsurance company Greater Atlantic Insurance Co. The three companies offer [[extended warranty]] policies to car buyers. Buchanan invests some of the proceeds from his reinsurance companies in real estate developments in [[the Bahamas]].<ref name="HT-10-31b">Michael Bragda, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061031/NEWS/610310410 "Use of offshore companies helps Buchanan reduce his tax burden"], ''Herald-Tribune'', October 31, 2006</ref>

===Ritz-Carlton===
In 1999, Buchanan was approached to help to finance the Ritz-Carlton condo-hotel development in [[Sarasota, Florida|Sarasota]]. Buchanan was cut out of the project. The developers, Robert Buford and Kevin Daves, said he lied about his financial means. Buchanan sued and the parties settled in 2001.<ref name="HT-9-10-06">Michael Braga, [http://www.heraldtribune.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060910/BUSINESS/609101145 "Accountants, others question settlement between Buchanan, wealthy developer"], ''Herald-Tribune'', September 10, 2006</ref> Per a structured settlement, Buchanan bought a condo from a nephew of Buford's for $5 million; the nephew had purchased it the day before for $2.368 million. Buchanan owned the unit a little more than a year and then sold it to another member of Buford's family for $6.35 million.  The arrangement resulted in Buchanan paying taxes on his gain at the reduced long-term capital gains rate. Buford benefited from the apartment's increased appraised value and the use of Buchanan's $5 million.<ref name="HT-9-10-06"/> In the year he owned the penthouse, Buchanan used it for charity fundraisers.<ref name="HT-9-10-06"/>

====Primary election====
Buchanan ran in the 13th congressional district in Florida to replace incumbent Republican [[Katherine Harris]], who was the Republican nominee for the [[U.S. Senate]]. Buchanan won the Republican primary with 32% of the vote, against four opponents. His closest challengers were [[Nancy C. Detert]], with 25% of the vote, and [[Tramm Hudson]], with 24%.

In the November general election, Buchanan faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Christine Jennings]], a banking executive. There were 216,000 registered Republicans and about 155,000 registered Democrats in the district,<ref>Jeremy Wallace, [http://www.theledger.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20061025/NEWS/610250312/1286/ELECTIONS "President Pitches In at Buchanan Fundraiser: Bush touts GOP principles at Vern Buchanan event in Sarasota"], ''The Ledger'', October 25, 2006</ref> but Jennings polled ahead of Buchanan up to election day.<ref name="economist">[http://www.economist.com/printedition/index.cfm?d=20061209 "Another election mess in Florida"], ''The Economist'', December 9, 2006</ref> Buchanan put more than $5 million of his own money into his campaign.<ref name="HT-10-31-06"/>

In October, Vice President Dick Cheney held a fund raising luncheon for Buchanan;<ref>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061006-10.html "Vice President's Remarks at a Luncheon for Vern Buchanan for Congress "], press release, October 6, 2006</ref> later that month, President Bush held a fund raising reception for him.<ref>[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/10/20061024-2.html "Remarks by the President at Vern Buchanan for Congress Reception"], press release, October 24, 2006</ref> Between the two events, Governor [[Jeb Bush]], Senator Martinez, and Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]] came to the district to campaign for Buchanan.<ref>[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/15344959/ "GOP launches rescue mission in Florida race: Once-secure congressional seat now in jeopardy, polls say"], ''Associated Press'', October 20, 2006</ref>

====General election====
Initial results of the November election showed Buchanan leading by less than 350 votes. Due to the closeness of the race, and a high undervote of 18,000 in [[Sarasota County, Florida|Sarasota County]], a recount was ordered. Voters in Sarasota County had given more votes to a hospital board than they had to their Congressional representative—with 13% of voters not voting, compared to an average of 2% in neighboring counties.<ref name="economist"/> The touch-screen voting machines used provided no paper record.<ref name="economist"/>  On November 20, 2006, the Florida Department of State certified the results of the recount, which showed Buchanan winning by 369 votes.

Jennings challenged the results of the election in court, citing "pervasive malfunctioning of electronic voting machines."<ref name="economist"/> In December 2006, a Florida circuit judge ruled that her claim that voting machines in Sarasota County lost up to 18,000 votes was "conjecture" and didn't warrant overriding the trade secrets of the voting machine company. In June 2007, a Florida state appellate court ruled that Jennings did not meet the "extraordinary burden" of proving the lower court judge was wrong.<ref>[http://cbs4.com/topstories/local_story_169202530.html "Jennings Dealt Setback In Voting Machine Challenge"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927192813/http://cbs4.com/topstories/local_story_169202530.html |date=September 27, 2007 }}, CBS local news (cbs4.com), June 18, 2007</ref> Another suit, filed by voters represented by [[Voter Action]], [[People For the American Way Foundation]], the [[ACLU of Florida]], and the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]]<ref>[https://www.eff.org/press/archives/200611 "Sarasota Voters File Lawsuit for Re-vote in Congressional Race "] Electronic Frontier Foundation, November 21, 2006</ref> was also dismissed.

The U.S. House of Representatives had the right to make the final determination as to whether Buchanan will hold the seat for the remainder of the term or be replaced by Jennings. In April, a three-person House task force was created to evaluate the election.<ref>Phil Davis,{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/04/17/ap3623464.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20070503062936/http://www.forbes.com/feeds/ap/2007/04/17/ap3623464.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=May 3, 2007 |title="House Panel to Consider Florida Contest" |accessdate=May 3, 2007 }} , ''Associated Press'', April 17, 2007</ref> In early May, the task force voted along party lines to refer an investigation into Florida's 13th district House race to the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO).<ref>Aaron Blake, [http://thehill.com/campaign-2008/fl-13-task-force-will-turn-over-investigation-to-gao-2007-05-02.html "FL-13 task force will turn over investigation to GAO"], ''The Hill'', May 3, 2007</ref> On February 25, 2008, the committee and the House accepted the GAO's findings that no machine error was demonstrated as sufficient to have altered the outcome of the election. The House passed HR 989 affirming the findings of the committee, accepting the results of the 2006 race and formally dismissing Jennings' challenge of the election's results. Jennings formally dropped her challenge shortly thereafter to focus on her 2008 rematch against Buchanan.<ref>{{cite news | title=US House dismisses challenge to Jennings' claim to seat | author=Lesley Clark | date=February 26, 2008 | url=http://miamiherald.typepad.com/nakedpolitics/2008/02/its-over-with-b.html}}</ref>

In 2008, the watchdog group [[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]] (CREW) filed an [[Federal Elections Commission]] (FEC) complaint, alleging "[[straw donor]]s" to Buchanan's campaign (campaign contributions from Buchanan's employees for which they were then reimbursed); in 2011, CREW requested a [[U.S. Department of Justice]] investigation.<ref name="Bresnahan"/> (The group also named Buchanan to its annual "most corrupt members of Congress" list for 2008, 2009, 2011, and 2012).<ref>{{cite web|title=Vern Buchanan|work=CREW'S Most Corrupt|url=http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/vern-buchanan|publisher=[[Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington]]|access-date=December 25, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031043001/http://www.crewsmostcorrupt.org/mostcorrupt/entry/vern-buchanan|archive-date=October 31, 2013|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}</ref>

By 2012, Buchanan was being investigated on the House Ethics Committee, FEC, Justice Department, and [[Office of Congressional Ethics]], over two separate allegations of [[campaign finance]] misconduct: that he had violated federal law and House rules by coercing a former business partner to sign a false affidavit to the FEC, and that he had illegally reimbursed car-dealership employees for campaign contributions.<ref name="Rahman">Rema Rahman, [http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/house-ethics-committee-clears-vern-buchanan-florida-fec-chaka-fattah House Ethics Committee Clears Vern Buchanan: Panel cites insufficient evidence against Florida congressman], ''Roll Call'' (June 24, 2016).</ref><ref name="BronsteinGriffin">{{cite web|authors=Scott Bronstein & Drew Griffin|url=http://www.cnn.com/2012/06/22/politics/congress-buchanan-allegations/|title=Powerful congressman accused of campaign finance violations|publisher=CNN|date=June 23, 2012}}</ref> The latter allegation was also raised in a lengthy and acrimonious legal dispute with Sam Kazran, Buchanan's former business partner, who alleged that Buchanan engaged in a "cash swap scheme" in which employees were directed to write checks to Buchanan's campaign fund, then reimbursed by the company.<ref name="BronsteinGriffin"/>

On June 23, 2016, the House Ethics Committee released this statement, concluding its investigation into Congressman Buchanan: "Because the evidence is insufficient to conclude that Representative Buchanan himself was aware of the unlawful reimbursements at the time they occurred, or had any role in directing or approving of them, and the evidence is insufficient to find that Representative Buchanan attempted to improperly influence the testimony of Mr. Kazran before the FEC, the Committee has determined to take no further action in this matter, and upon publication of this Report,considers the matter closed."
