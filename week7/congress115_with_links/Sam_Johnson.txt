;POW
On April 16, 1966, while flying his 25th combat mission in [[Vietnam]], he was shot down over [[North Vietnam]] and suffered a broken arm and back. He was a [[prisoner of war]] for nearly seven years, including 42 months in solitary confinement. During this period, he was repeatedly [[torture]]d.

Johnson was part of a group of eleven U.S. military prisoners known as the [[Alcatraz Gang]], a group of prisoners separated from other captives for their resistance to their captors. They were held in "Alcatraz", a special facility about one mile away from the [[Hỏa Lò Prison]], notably nicknamed the "Hanoi Hilton". Johnson, like the others, was kept in solitary confinement, locked nightly in [[Legcuffs|irons]] in a windowless 3-by-9-foot concrete cell with the light on around the clock.<ref>Adams, Lorraine.
