===Political campaigns===
;2004
In 2004, Costa entered the Democratic primary for the 20th district, which was opened up by the retirement of its seven-term incumbent, [[Cal Dooley]]. Dooley endorsed his chief of staff, Lisa Quigley, as his successor, but most of the state's Democratic Party establishment, including [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Dianne Feinstein]], endorsed Costa, who won the bruising primary and faced [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] state senator [[Roy Ashburn]] in November.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The 20th district is a heavily Democratic, 63% Latino-majority district; it gave [[Al Gore]] his highest vote total outside the state's two large [[conurbation]]s ([[Sacramento, California|Sacramento]] and the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] in the north and [[Los Angeles]] and [[San Diego]] to the south). Nonetheless, the Republicans spent a substantial amount of money on the race. Ashburn's campaign made plays on Costa's name, "Costa's going to cost ya," and linked him to former Governor [[Gray Davis]], calling them "two taxing twins".{{cn|date=August 2018}} Costa won the election with 54% of the vote to Ashburn's 46%. Ashburn kept the margin within single digits by winning heavily Republican [[Kings County, California|Kings County]].

;2006
Costa ran unopposed for reelection in 2006. The Democrats won control of the House in that election, and Costa became chairman of the [[U.S. House Committee on Natural Resources|Natural Resources Committee]]'s Energy and Mineral Resources Subcommittee. He is a member of the [[United States House Committee on Agriculture|House Agriculture Committee]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

;2008
Costa was reelected in 2008 with 74 percent of the vote, the highest percentage for a Democratic incumbent outside Sacramento, the Bay Area and Southern California.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

;2010
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2010#District 20}}
Costa was challenged for reelection by Republican nominee [[Andy Vidak]]. In his closest race yet, the race was officially called for Costa nearly three weeks after election day,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/-200878-1.html|title=Costa Holds Seat, Keeps GOP Pickups at 63: Roll Call Politics|publisher=Rollcall.com|date=2010-11-23|accessdate=2011-10-30}}</ref> with the unofficial final tally standing at 45,806 votes (51.8%) for Costa and 42,773 votes (48.2%) for Vidak.

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in California, 2012#District 16}}
For his first four terms, Costa represented a district including most of the majority-Latino portions of Fresno and [[Bakersfield]]. However, redistricting following the 2010 census renumbered his district as the 21st district and made it slightly more Republican. In February 2012, Costa officially announced that he would run in the newly formed 16th district, a much more compact district that included most of Fresno as well as most of [[Merced, California|Merced]].<ref name="Announces 2012">{{cite news|title=Rep. Jim Costa Announces Reelection Campaign|url=http://www.cbs47.tv/news/local/story/Rep-Jim-Costa-Announces-Reelection-Campaign/b1uJQZDfuUCMqVVX0QJXCg.cspx|newspaper=CBS}}</ref> While most of his old territory remained in the 21st, the new 16th absorbed most of the Fresno County portion of his old district, including his home.

Costa faced Republican Brian Whelan in the general election. After the new districts were announced, it was reported that the [[National Republican Congressional Committee|NRCC]] considered Costa vulnerable to defeat.<ref name="Redistricting Gains">{{cite news|title=Republicans Tout Redistricting Gains |url=http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2012/03/republicans-tou-1.php |newspaper=National Journal |date=March 28, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019031129/http://hotlineoncall.nationaljournal.com/archives/2012/03/republicans-tou-1.php |archivedate=October 19, 2012 |df= }}</ref> However, had it existed in 2008, [[Barack Obama]] would have carried it with 57 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1VfkHtzBTP5gf4jAu8tcVQgsBJ1IDvXEHjuMqYlOgYbA/edit#gid=0|title=Daily Kos Elections 2008, 2012 & 2016 presidential election results for congressional districts used in 2016 elections|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2018}}</ref>

In November 2011, the [[League of Conservation Voters]] ran a series of television ads in Costa's district criticizing his environmental record.<ref name="Right and left">{{cite news|title=Jim Costa responds to attacks from the right, and the left|url=http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/politics&id=8429406|newspaper=ABC News}}</ref> Costa was reelected in 2012 with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2012/results/state/CA/house/16|title=U.S. House: California District 16 - 2012 Election Center|work=CNN}}</ref>

Costa faced an unexpectedly close race against Republican Johnny Tacherra, a dairyman from rural Fresno County. On election night, Tacherra led by 736 votes, a margin that grew to 1,772 votes a few days later. However, Tacherra's lead narrowed as counting continued, and Costa ultimately defeated him by 1,319 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fresnobee.com/2014/11/19/4243494/madera-merced-vote-count-updates.html|title=Jim Costa keeps House seat, edging out Johnny Tacherra in another late-vote rally|work=Fresno Bee|date=November 19, 2014|accessdate=December 11, 2014}}</ref> While Tacherra carried the district's portions of Merced and Madera counties, Costa defeated him in Fresno County by 9,600 votes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/election/2014/results/state/CA/house/16/|title=California House results -- 2014 Election Center -- Elections and Politics from CNN.com|publisher=|accessdate=25 May 2018}}</ref>

He was expected to be paired once again in the general election with Republican Johnny Tacherra, who was in second place with 33.1%, 30,342 votes.<ref>[http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/us-rep/district/16/ 16 District returns] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160709180219/http://vote.sos.ca.gov/returns/us-rep/district/16/ |date=2016-07-09 }}, ''[[California Secretary of State]]'', June 28, 2016. Retrieved 28 June 2016.</ref> The counting of ballots was finalized on June 30.

==Political positions==
===Agriculture===
Costa was one of the sponsors for the bipartisan Agricultural Certainty for Reporting Emissions (ACRE) Act. The act would strip provisions from Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), which was responsible for ensuring cleanup of industrial toxic waste dumps, oil spills, and chemical tank explosions environmental regulations on farm land.<ref>{{cite web |title=NCBA Hails Introduction of Bipartisan ACRE Act in U.S. House of Representatives |url=https://www.beefusa.org/newsreleases.aspx?NewsID=6613 |website=National Cattlemen's Beef Association |accessdate=August 29,  2018}}</ref> If enacted, this act would reduce transparency by allowing the livestock industry to hide their waste storage and disposal methods. Another provision would make it easier for farmers to dump pesticides into waterways regulated under the [[Clean Water Act]].<ref>{{cite web |last1=Liebmann |first1=Larissa |title=Don’t Let CAFOs Hide Their Pollution | Dive Into Democracy |url=https://waterkeeper.org/dont-let-cafos-hide-their-pollution-dive-into-democracy/ |website=Waterkeeper's Alliance |accessdate=August 29, 2018}}</ref>

He ultimately voted in favor of the legislation.<ref name="Costa yes">{{cite news|title=Costa a yes|url=http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0310/Costa_a_yes.html|newspaper=Politico|date=March 10, 2010}}</ref> To gain Costa's vote, the House leadership reportedly promised Costa and [[Dennis Cardoza]] funding for a medical school for California's Central Valley.<ref name="Bills move along">{{cite news|title=Side deals stack up as health bills move along|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/senate/69239-side-deals-stack-up-in-health-bills|newspaper=The Hill|date=November 23, 2009}}</ref>

===High-speed rail===
Costa has been an advocate of creating a [[California High-Speed Rail|high-speed rail system]] that would go up and down California as well as across the nation at speeds of 225 miles-per-hour. He has introduced many bills supporting these rails; so far, none have passed.

In April 2008, Costa wrote a piece in ''Capitol Weekly'' calling for high-speed rail in California.<ref name="Transportation system">{{cite web|title=High speed rail: a viable transportation system for California |url=http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?_adctlid=v%7Cjq2q43wvsl855o%7Cx1wzkesety80ym&issueId=x1uh8zbb6q8afq&xid=x1uzxza4c74tim |publisher=Capitol Weekly |accessdate=November 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110209070157/http://www.capitolweekly.net/article.php?issueId=x1uh8zbb6q8afq&xid=x1uzxza4c74tim&_adctlid=v%7Cjq2q43wvsl855o%7Cx1wzkesety80ym |archivedate=February 9, 2011 |df= }}</ref>

===National cemetery burials===
In December 2017, Costa introduced legislation to allow some Hmong- and Laotian-American veterans to be buried in U.S. national cemeteries. The legislation applies to Hmong and Laotian veterans who fought alongside the U.S. against North Vietnamese forces in the 1960s and 1970s. The bill, which does  not allow for burials at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], applies only to veterans who pass away on or after the bill's enactment. The bill was enacted in March 2018 as part of the [[Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2018|Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018]].<ref>{{cite news |last1=Constante |first1=Agnes |title=Congress passes law allowing national cemetery burials for 'secret war' veterans |url=https://www.nbcnews.com/news/asian-america/congress-passes-law-allowing-national-cemetery-burials-secret-war-veterans-n862346 |accessdate=24 August 2018 |publisher=NBC News |date=April 3, 2018}}</ref>
