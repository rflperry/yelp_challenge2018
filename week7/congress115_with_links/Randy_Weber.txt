In January 2014, during President Obama's State of the Union address, Weber in a tweet referred to the President as "Kommandant-In-Chef" [''sic''] and "the Socialist dictator." After the White House apologized for failing to send a more high profile leader to a demonstration in Paris following the [[Charlie Hebdo shooting|January 2015 terrorist attacks]] in that city, Weber tweeted, "Even Adolph [''sic''] Hitler thought it more important than Obama to get to Paris."<ref name="WashPostOhlheiser01132015"/> Weber then wrote that he needed to "apologize to all those offended by my tweet".  He did not choose to withdraw his earlier tweet made during the State of the Union address.<ref name="WashPostOhlheiser01132015">{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/post-politics/wp/2015/01/13/texas-congressman-randy-weber-says-obama-is-basically-worse-than-hitler/ |title=Texas Rep.
