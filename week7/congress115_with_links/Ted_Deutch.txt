===Tenure===
[[File:Congressman Ted Deutch meets with Emma González.jpg|thumb|left|Deutch meets with [[Emma González]] on February 19, 2018.]]
Deutch was sworn in as a member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] on April 15, 2010.

In the wake of the [[Stoneman Douglas High School shooting]], Deutch spoke out in favor of expanded gun control legislation. He spoke at a CNN town hall meeting and urged action. "A lot of people have told this community -- people from all around the world -- that it's too soon," he said. "It's too soon to get together to have this kind of forum. It's too soon to talk about preventing another tragedy like the one that struck our community from happening anywhere again. It's too soon to talk about getting weapons of war out of our communities. It is not too soon. It is too late for the 17 lives that were lost."<ref name=CNN-transcript>{{cite news |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/22/politics/cnn-town-hall-full-video-transcript/index.html |title=Transcript: Stoneman students' questions to lawmakers and the NRA at the CNN town hall |work=[[CNN]] |date=22 February 2018|accessdate=2018-02-25}}</ref>

During the 2011 debate regarding the debt ceiling, Deutch assembled and brought to the house floor an elaborate, game-show style wheel to illustrate which government services he claimed would be endangered by a default on the U.S. national debt.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://videocafe.crooksandliars.com/david/rep-ted-deutch-spins-gop-wheel-misfortune-ho|title=Rep.

==Political positions==
===Gun policy===
Deutch believes that acceptable limitations can be placed on the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] right to bear arms, saying, "the majority of people in this country now understand that there are limitations on the Second Amendment.  You cannot own an automatic weapon.  You cannot own a bazooka.  And so there is no reason to continue to sell to people a weapon of war like this," referencing semi-automatic rifles.<ref name="whitehouse"/>
During his tenure as Congressman, Deutch has voted on several pieces of gun legislation.
He voted against [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/38 H. R. 38] (the [[Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017|Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act]]), which would enable [[Concealed carry in the United States#Reciprocity|concealed carry reciprocity]] among all States if and when it is signed into law.<ref name="HR38">{{cite web| url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll663.xml| title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 663| website=clerk.house.gov|publisher=U.S. Federal Government|date=6 December 2017| access-date=7 March 2018}}</ref>
Deutch also voted against [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-joint-resolution/40 H. J. Res. 40], which ultimately passed and used the [[Congressional Review Act]] to [[Repeal of the Implementation of the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007|block implementation]] of an Obama-era Amendment to the [[NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007]] that was aimed at preventing the mentally-infirm from legally purchasing firearms.<ref name="Clerk 2017">{{cite web| url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2017/roll077.xml| website=clerk.house.gov|publisher=U.

Deutch cosponsored [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/5087/text H. R. 5087], the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018, saying, "Americans don't own tanks or missiles; so why should our streets be flooded with weapons of war made for the sole purpose of killing people?"<ref name="Deutch 2018">{{cite web| url=https://teddeutch.house.gov/news/documentsingle.aspx?DocumentID=399277| title=Reps.

Deutch also announced his support for [https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/4909/text H. R. 4909], the [[STOP School Violence Act]] of 2018.
The STOP School Violence Act would allow grants to train school staff how to identify troubled students and intervene before crises.
The grants could also be used for developing an anonymous reporting system for students to submit concerns, as well as improving the physical infrastructure of schools against attacks.<ref name="Rogers 2018">{{cite web| url=https://halrogers.house.gov/press-releases?ID=8E6FA2F1-B670-488A-AE3C-FA13D9CA450E| title=Sandy Hook Promise Applauds Bipartisan Introduction of Critical School Safety Legislation entitled the STOP School Violence Act of 2018, Urging Swift Passage in Congress| date=27 February 2018| website=United States Congressman Hal Rogers| publisher=U.
