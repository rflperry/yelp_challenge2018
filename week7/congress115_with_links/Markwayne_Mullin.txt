==U.S. House of Representatives==

===2012 election===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Oklahoma, 2012}}
Incumbent [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] U.S. congressman [[Dan Boren]] decided to retire in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.krmg.com/news/news/local/markwayne-mullin-makes-congressional-bid-official/nDfR2/ |title=Markwayne Mullin makes Congressional bid official |publisher=www.krmg.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}</ref> Mullin declared his candidacy for the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Oklahoma, 2012|2012 elections]] to the [[United States House of Representatives]] to represent [[Oklahoma's 2nd congressional district]] in September 2011. In the six-candidate Republican primary, Mullin ranked first with 42% of the vote, failing to reach the over 50% threshold. State representative [[George Faught]] ranked second with 22% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=735568 |title=OK District 2 – R Primary Race – Jun 26, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> In the run-off primary election, Mullin defeated Faught 57%–43%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=771199 |title=OK District 2 – R Runoff Race – Aug 28, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref><ref>[http://www.ok.gov/elections/support/ok_results_seb.html State Election Results, Runoff], [http://www.ok.gov/elections Oklahoma State Elections Board].</ref> He branded himself as an outsider; his campaign slogan was "A rancher.

The second has historically been a classic [[Yellow Dog Democrat|"Yellow Dog" Democratic]] district.  However, it has steadily trended Republican, as [[Tulsa]]'s suburbs have spilled into the northern portion of the district. For these reasons, Mullin was thought to have a good chance of winning the election. In the general election, Mullin defeated the Democratic candidate, Rob Wallace, a former [[District Attorney|district attorney]], 57%–38%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=705055 |title=OK – District 02 Race – Nov 06, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2013-08-30}}</ref> He became the first Republican to represent the district, since [[Tom Coburn]] in 2001,<ref name="tulsa">{{cite news | url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/article.aspx?subjectid=262&articleid=20121107_16_EC3_CUTLIN289219 | title=Republican Markwayne Mullin voted into 2nd District Seat | work=Tulsa World | date=November 7, 2012 | accessdate=November 8, 2012 | author=Krehbiel, Mark}}</ref> and only the second since 1921.

===Miami Tribe revocation===

On February 5, 2014, Mullin introduced the bill [[To revoke the charter of incorporation of the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma at the request of that tribe (H.R. 4002; 113th Congress)]], which would accept the request of the [[Miami Tribe of Oklahoma]] to revoke the charter of incorporation issued to that tribe and ratified by its members on June 1, 1940.<ref name=4002sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4002 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4002|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=23 June 2014}}</ref>

===2017 town hall comments===
In April 2017, Mullin drew criticism when he was recorded during a town hall meeting telling his constituents that it was "bullcrap" that taxpayers pay his salary. He said, "I pay for myself. I paid enough taxes before I got here and continue to through my company to pay my own salary. This is a service. No one here pays me to go."<ref name=HillSalary>{{cite news |title=GOP rep: 'Bullcrap' to say taxpayers pay my salary|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/328615-gop-rep-bullcrap-to-say-taxpayers-pay-my-salary-i-pay-for|work=The Hill|date=13 April 2017|accessdate=13 April 2017|author=NIKITA VLADIMIROV}}</ref> According to the January 2012 [[Congressional Research Service]], the [[United States House of Representatives#Salary and benefits|salary of a U.S. representative]] is $174,000 per year, and [[United States House of Representatives#Salary and benefits|benefits]] include allowances, cost-of-living adjustments, enrollment in a pension, health benefits, personnel, mail and office expenses, and a travel allowance.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://library.clerk.house.gov/reference-files/112_20120104_Salary.pdf|title=Congressional Salaries and Allowances|last=Brudnick|first=Ida A.|date=January 4, 2012|website=|access-date=April 14, 2017}}</ref>

===Running for a fourth term===
During the 2012 campaign, Mullin promised to serve for only three terms (six years), meaning that he would have left Congress in 2019.  However, in July 2017, Mullin released an eleven-minute video announcing that he would indeed run for a fourth term in 2018, saying he was ill-advised when he made the promise to only serve three terms.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Krehbiel|first1=Randy|title=Markwayne Mullin to seek fourth term, explains why he's breaking three-term campaign pledge|url=http://www.tulsaworld.com/news/elections/markwayne-mullin-to-seek-fourth-term-explains-why-he-s/article_4d86dc23-965d-57be-b8c2-4d1832371d71.html|website=Tulsa World|publisher=Tulsa World|accessdate=2017-07-13}}</ref>
