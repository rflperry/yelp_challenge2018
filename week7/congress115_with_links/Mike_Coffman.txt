In 1972, Coffman enlisted in the U.S. Army, and was assigned to a mechanized infantry battalion. The following year, he earned a high school diploma through an army program. Leaving active duty for the U.S. Army Reserve in 1974, he entered the [[University of Colorado at Boulder|University of Colorado]], under the [[G.I. Bill]] graduating in 1979 with a [[bachelor's degree]] in [[political science]].<ref>[http://projects.wsj.com/campaign2012/candidates/view/mike-coffman--CO-H Mike Coffman (R), Winner U.S. Representative – CO6], Election 2012, [[Wall Street Journal]]</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Mike Coffman Full Biography|url=http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|website=Mike Coffman U.S. Representative|accessdate=December 2, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141205210836/http://coffman.house.gov/about/full-biography|archivedate=December 5, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> He also studied at [[DG Vaishnav College|Vaishnav College]] in [[Chennai]], [[India]], and the [[Universidad Veracruzana|University of Veracruz]] in [[Mexico]]. Upon graduation from the University of Colorado, Coffman transferred from the Army Reserve to the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1979, becoming an infantry officer. In 1983, he transferred from active duty to the [[Marine Forces Reserve|Marine Reserves]], serving until 1994. In 1983, he created an Aurora, Colorado-based [[property management]] firm, serving as senior [[shareholder]] until 2000.

==State politics and military deployments==

===Colorado Legislature===
Coffman began his political career serving as a member of the [[Colorado House of Representatives]] from 1989 to 1994. Shortly after winning re-election in 1990, he took an unpaid leave of absence from the statehouse during his active duty service in the [[Gulf War|Persian Gulf War]], during which time he saw combat as a light armored infantry officer. He was awarded the [[Combat Action Ribbon]] after his first deployment. In 1994, he retired from the U.S. Marine Corps after 20 years of combined service in the Army, Army Reserve, Marines, and Marine Reserve. In 2006, Coffman returned to active duty in the Marines where he deployed to Iraq for combat service. Upon return from his deployment, he retired from the Marine Corps once again after a total of 22 years of military service.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Ye Hee Lee|first1=Michelle|title=Rep.

===Colorado Treasurer===
In 1998, Coffman was elected as State Treasurer of Colorado with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic nominee Jim Polsfut.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=882|title=CO Treasurer Race |date=November 3, 1998|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref> In 2002, he was re-elected with 56%, defeating Democratic State Senator [[Terry Phillips (politician)|Terry Phillips]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=878|title=CO Treasurer Race |date=November 5, 2002|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

He resigned from that post in 2005 in order to resume his career in the U.S. Marines, and serve in the [[Iraq War|War in Iraq]], where he helped support the [[Independent High Electoral Commission|Independent Electoral Commission of Iraq]], which oversaw two national elections, and helped establish interim local governments in the western Euphrates Valley. In 2006, he completed his duty in Iraq and was re-appointed as State Treasurer. He served that position for only a few months because in November 2006, he was elected [[Colorado Secretary of State]] with 51% of the vote, defeating Democratic State Senator and Minority Leader Ken Gordon.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=179258|title=CO Secretary of State Race |date=November 7, 2006|publisher=Our Campaigns |accessdate=October 12, 2014}}</ref>

During the general election of 2008, when Coffman was Secretary of State of Colorado, several groups accused the secretary of state's office of improperly marking 6,400 voter registration forms as incomplete, because they failed to check a box on the form, required by legislation sponsored by then Senate Majority Leader Ken Gordon, a Democrat, in 2006.<ref name="RockyMountainNews_Kim_20081014">{{cite web|url=http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/14/voting-forms-ruled-incomplete-for-lack-of-check/|title=Voting forms ruled incomplete for lack of check mark|last=Kim|first=Myung Oak|date=October 14, 2008|work=Rocky Mountain News|accessdate=October 24, 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015162624/http://www.rockymountainnews.com/news/2008/oct/14/voting-forms-ruled-incomplete-for-lack-of-check/|archivedate=October 15, 2008}}</ref> Incomplete registrations require voters to either re-register or provide extra identification when they go to vote.<ref name="RockyMountainNews_Kim_20081014" /> Soon after the accusations were made, [[Common Cause]] filed suit against Coffman, in his official capacity as secretary of state.

Coffman has a "B+" rating from marijuana legalization group [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) regarding his voting record on [[cannabis]]-related matters. He supports allowing veterans access to [[medical marijuana]], if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation. He also supports allowing cannabis businesses access to banking, medical marijuana research, and industrial [[hemp]] farming.<ref name="NORML">{{cite web|title=Colorado Scorecard - NORML.org - Working to Reform Marijuana Laws|url=http://norml.org/congressional-scorecard/colorado|website=norml.org|accessdate=22 December 2017|language=en-us}}</ref>

In January 2018, Coffman joined other Colorado congressman in criticizing a memo by Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] announcing his intention to rescind the Obama-era practice of allowing states to make marijuana use legal. Coffman suggested that the memo violated the constitution’s commerce clause. “The decision that was made to legalize marijuana in Colorado was made by the voters of Colorado and only applies within the boundaries of our state,” he said. “Colorado had every right to legalize marijuana and I will do everything I can do protect that right against the power of an overreaching federal government.”<ref>Abramson, Alana; Colorado Lawmakers Are Not Happy About Jeff Sessions' New Marijuana Restrictions; TIME; January 4, 2018; http://time.com/5088589/colorado-lawmakers-reactions-jeff-sessions-marijuana-restrictions/</ref>

=== Donald Trump ===
Coffman did not endorse [[Donald Trump]], the Republican Party's nominee for U.S. president in 2016.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mike-coffman-ad-donald-trump_us_57a34e10e4b04414d1f3b54e|title=Republican Congressman Runs Ad Saying He Doesn't Like Donald Trump|date=August 4, 2016|publisher=Huffington Post|last1=Foley|first1=Elise|accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref> In August 2016, he ran an advertisement promising to "stand up" to Trump.

In February 2017, he voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request ten years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the [[United States House Committee on Ways and Means|House Ways and Means Committee]] in a closed session.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://indy100.com/article/republican-vote-donald-trump-tax-president-united-states-229-185-congress-7603851|title=These are all the Republicans who don't want you to see Donald Trump's tax returns|date=2017-02-28|work=indy100|access-date=2017-03-01|language=en-GB}}</ref>

In April 2017, Coffman told a town hall crowd he would support legislation that requires the President, Vice President, members of Congress, and all those seeking federal office to publicly release their tax returns prior to an election.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lx3KcATLniI |title=Mike Coffman on Donald Trump's taxes |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2018-01-09}}</ref>

Coffman called for the firing of White House National Security Adviser [[Michael T. Flynn]] over interactions Flynn had with Russian officials. After Flynn was fired, Coffman said "I want to see that transcript to see if there are other conversations that he had is worthwhile finding out, but I also think it's important to move on."<ref>{{cite news|title=Coffman Responds To Firing Of Michael Flynn|url=http://denver.cbslocal.com/2017/02/15/coffman-responds-to-firing-of-michael-flynn/|accessdate=9 January 2018|publisher=CBS Denver|date=February 15, 2017}}</ref>

===Birther conspiracy theories===
In May 2012, Coffman stated that he did not know where President Barack Obama was born. Coffman went on to say of Obama that "in his heart, he's not an American. He's just not an American." Coffman issued an apology several days later, saying that he had misspoken and that he had confidence in President Obama's citizenship and legitimacy as president.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/breakingnews/ci_20642001/mike-coffman-says-obama-not-an-american-at|title=Coffman Speech in Elbert County|last=Clark|first=Kyle|date=May 16, 2012|work=The Denver Post|accessdate=June 2, 2012}}</ref> In a <i>Denver Post</i> op-ed later that month, Coffman described his comment as "inappropriate and boneheaded."<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.denverpost.com/opinion/ci_20694265/mike-coffman-comment-was-inappropriate-boneheaded|title=Mike Coffman: Obama comment was boneheaded|last=Coffman|first=Mike|date=May 24, 2012|work=The Denver Post}}</ref><ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Latest-News-Wires/2012/0525/Colo.-Congressman-Mike-Coffman-expands-birther-apology|title=Colo.

===Economic issues===
Coffman voted against the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], which was a stimulus package intended to save and create jobs, and provide temporary relief programs as a response to the [[Great Recession]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.columbinecourier.com/content/coffman-calls-obamas-stimulus-lsquoagenda-drivenrsquo-says-it-wont-stimulate-economy|title=Coffman calls Obama's stimulus ‘agenda-driven,’ says it won't stimulate economy|website=Columbine Courier|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> Coffman cited a nonexistent [[Congressional Budget Office]] study to justify his vote against the stimulus package.<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/20384/coffman-cites-nonexistent-cbo-study-as-reason-to-vote-against-stimulus|title=Coffman cites nonexistent CBO study as reason to vote against stimulus|date=2009-01-29|newspaper=The Colorado Independent|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en-US}}</ref> Coffman later claimed that "the Congressional Budget Office estimates have been changed or suppressed".<ref>{{Cite news|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/20457/coffman-spokesman-responds-on-rationale-for-voting-against-stimulus|title=Coffman spokesman responds on rationale for voting against stimulus|date=2009-01-29|newspaper=The Colorado Independent|access-date=2017-02-18|language=en-US}}</ref>

He voted in support of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].<ref name="Almukhtar">{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=0|website=The New York Times|accessdate=22 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}</ref> Regarding his vote, Coffman says "I think the economy is going to perform a lot better."

===Gun rights===
In 2017, he voted for a bill that would require states to accept concealed-carry permits from other, less-regulated states. He also supported a bill that would reverse an Obama administration rule confiscating guns from people unable to manage their Social Security benefits. At a February 2018 town hall, Coffman said he would consider “reasonable restrictions” on gun rights “within the parameters of the Second Amendment.” He said he would not support an assault-weapons ban, but would allow the temporary confiscation of firearms from persons who represented a threat to themselves or others.<ref>Boos punctuate town hall on guns held by Colorado congressman Mike Coffman; CBS News; February 21, 2018; https://www.cbsnews.com/news/boos-punctuate-town-hall-on-guns-held-by-colorado-congressman-mike-coffman/</ref>

=== Healthcare ===
Coffman is in favor of a "full repeal" of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|Affordable Care Act]] (Obamacare).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2017/01/13/reality-check-fixing-health-care-requires-repeal-of-obamacare/|title=Colorado's GOP Congressmen: Time for a reality check, full repeal of Obamacare|access-date=2017-02-18}}</ref> In January 2017, he voted in support of legislation that began the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act (ACA).<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://kdvr.com/2017/01/16/rep-coffman-issues-statement-after-contentious-meeting/|title=Rep.

=== Military and veterans affairs ===
In 2011, Coffman proposed a half billion dollars in cuts to military programs such as education reimbursements, the [[Selective Service System|Selective Service]] and the military's health plan, [[Tricare|TRICARE]], saying that the programs "have been neglected for a long time. Every dollar wasted is a dollar not going to our war fighters.  What they do is important to this country, and we should focus on them."<ref>Sherry, Allison.

In December 2017, Coffman and [[Elizabeth Esty]] (D-CT) introduced H.R. 4635 to “direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to increase the number of peer-to-peer counselors providing counseling for women veterans.”<ref>H.R.4635 introduced in House by Mike Coffman; US Tribune News; December 19, 2017; https://ustribune.news/2017/12/19/h-r-4635-introduced-in-house-by-mike-coffman/</ref>

In March 2018, Coffman called on President Trump to fire VA Secretary [[David Shulkin]] over his travel expenses and other issues. Coffman wrote the president that Shulkin “lacks the moral authority to achieve your goals of a transparent, accountable VA that is dedicated to meeting our nation's obligations to the men and women who wore the uniform and made tremendous sacrifices in defense of our freedoms.”<ref>Boyer, Dave; Rep.

===Net neutrality===
In July 2018, Coffman supported a congressional bill to reinstate [[net neutrality]] rules.<ref>Brodkin, Jon; Arstechnica.com:"''Bill to save net neutrality gets first Republican vote in US House.''" 17 July 2018.

===Immigration===
In August 2014, Coffman broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the [[Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals]] program.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/08/01/house-bill-daca_n_5643287.html|title=House Votes To Strip Deportation Relief From Dreamers|date=January 8, 2014|publisher=The Huffington Post|last1=Foley|first1=Elise|accessdate=September 4, 2014}}</ref> In October 2015, Coffman and Democrat [[Tammy Duckworth]] co-sponsored the Military Enlistment Opportunity Act, which would provide undocumented immigrant children an opportunity to serve in the U.S. military and gain a path to citizenship.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/114th-congress/house-bill/3698/text|title=H.R.3698 - Military Enlistment Opportunity Act of 2015|publisher=Congress.gov|accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://kdvr.com/2014/05/20/coffman-to-push-for-military-dreamers-bill-already-dismissed-by-gop-leadership/|title=Coffman to push for military DREAMers bill already dismissed by GOP leadership|date=May 20, 2014|publisher=KDVR|last1=Stokols|first1=Eli|accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref>

Coffman opposed President [[Donald Trump]]'s 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, stating: "While I've supported heightened vetting procedures, I have never, nor will I ever support a blanket travel ban, for people solely based on ethnic or religious grounds."<ref name="Blake1">{{cite web|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=Whip Count: Here's where Republicans stand on Trump's controversial travel ban|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/01/29/heres-where-republicans-stand-on-president-trumps-controversial-travel-ban|newspaper=Washington Post|date=January 31, 2017}}</ref>

In 2017, Coffman petitioned the House to pass a law protecting DREAMers. In September of that year, however, Representative [[Bob Goodlatte]] chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, said he would not act on any such legislation before addressing criminal foreign gangs and border security. Coffman then withdrew his petition, saying, “'With all the other things going on right now, it's kind of put on the back burner.” He said, though, that he would sign a Democratic petition to force a vote on the [[DREAM Act]].<ref>Alcindor, Yamiche; Action to Protect Young Immigrants Already Stumbles in Congress; New York Times; September 12, 2017; https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/us/politics/daca-dream-act-congress-trump.html</ref>

In June 2018, Coffman said the Trump administration was “heading in the wrong direction” on immigration owing to [[Stephen Miller (political advisor)|Stephen Miller]]'s role as a presidential advisor. Coffman said that Trump should fire Miller, whom he described as “completely tone deaf when it comes to reforming our immigration system.”<ref>Perticone, Joe; A Republican congressman explains why he's going to war with top White House adviser Stephen Miller; Business Insider; June 22, 2018; http://www.businessinsider.com/mike-coffman-trump-administration-going-in-wrong-direction-2018-6?r=US&IR=T&IR=T</ref>

Also in June 2018, he talked to [[NPR]] about the separation of illegal immigrants from their children, saying that the White House should “appoint one person solely focused on the reunification issue of these families.” He said he had visited a detention center for children, and found the conditions there to be “pretty good.”<ref>Cornish, Audie; Colorado Rep.

=== Voting rights ===
In September 2016, Coffman co-sponsored the Voting Rights Amendment Act of 2015, which would restore some protections in the 1965 [[Voting Rights Act]] that had been removed by the [[United States Supreme Court]].<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.coloradoindependent.com/161187/mike-coffman-voting-rights-act|title=Mike Coffman quietly signs onto the Voting Rights Amendment Act|date=September 12, 2016|publisher=Colorado Independent|last1=Hutchins|first1=Corey|accessdate=24 September 2016}}</ref>
