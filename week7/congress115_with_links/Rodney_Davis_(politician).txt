In a June 2018 interview, he reiterated concern about some of President Trump's proposed tariffs impact on his constituents as well as their impact on certain foreign countries. Although he felt “the president was right to actually address the steel discrepancy that he saw from countries like China,” he wished that Trump “would focus on...actors like China rather than punishing our allies.”<ref>Rep.

Davis introduced the [[Hire More Heroes Act of 2013 (H.R. 3474; 113th Congress)|Hire More Heroes Act of 2013]] into the House on November 13, 2013.
