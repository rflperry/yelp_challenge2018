===2014 election===
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Indiana, 2014}}

In the primary election on May 6, Brooks defeated Stockdale and his fellow challenger, David Campbell, winning 73% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.in.gov/apps/sos/primary/sos_primary14?page=office&countyID=-1&partyID=-1&officeID=5&districtID=-1&districtshortviewID=-1&candidate=|title=Secretary of State : Election Division: Election Results|publisher=|accessdate=27 October 2014}}</ref> On November 4, Brooks won the general election with 65% of the vote, defeating Democrat Shawn Denney and Libertarian John Krom.<ref>{{Cite web|title = Indiana's 5th Congressional District elections, 2014 - Ballotpedia|url = https://ballotpedia.org/Indiana's_5th_Congressional_District_elections,_2014|website = ballotpedia.org|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}</ref>

On December 19, 2017, Brooks voted in favor of the [[Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017]].<ref name="Almukhtar">{{cite web|last1=Almukhtar|first1=Sarah|title=How Each House Member Voted on the Tax Bill|url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/12/19/us/politics/tax-bill-house-live-vote.html?_r=1|website=The New York Times|accessdate=28 December 2017|date=19 December 2017}}</ref>

On May 4, 2017, Brooks voted for the American Health Care Act, reversing her position of February 2017, when she claimed to oppose taking insurance from people with preexisting conditions.

On July 29, 2015, Brooks introduced the Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act of 2015, H.R. 3299, bipartisan legislation that will dramatically transform and enhance the nation’s ability to respond to current and emerging biothreats. This legislation reforms our nation’s medical countermeasure acquisition process, incentivizes research to combat the next generation of deadly diseases, and increases accountability of preparedness spending. It is one of the legislative proposals highlighted by the bipartisan Blue Ribbon Panel Study on Biodefense as an important step towards shoring up our national security and preparedness for biothreats.

On June 17, 2015, Brooks introduced the Heroin and Prescription Opioid Abuse Prevention, Education, and Enforcement Act of 2015, H.R. 2805, which targets several areas of need critical to reducing the number of painkiller and heroin overdose deaths each year. The legislation will establish a working group to develop new guidance and best practices for members of the medical community, reauthorize prescription drug monitoring programs (PDMP) critical to local law enforcement efforts, increase access to life-saving Naloxone and raise public, provider, and patient awareness of opioid drugs. It is the companion bill to S. 1134, legislation introduced by Senators Joe Donnelly (D-IN) and Kelly Ayotte (R-NH) in April 2015.

On March 14, 2014, Brooks introduced the [[Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 (H.R. 4263; 113th Congress)|Social Media Working Group Act of 2014 (H.R. 4263, 113th Congress)]]; H.R. 623, 114th Congress), a bill that would direct the [[United States Secretary of Homeland Security]] to establish within the [[United States Department of Homeland Security]] (DHS) a [[social media]] working group to provide guidance and best practices to the [[Emergency management|emergency preparedness and response]] community on the use of social media technologies before, during, and after a [[terrorist attack]].<ref name="4263sum">{{cite web|title=H.R. 4263 – Summary|url=https://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4263|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=7 July 2014}}</ref> This legislation was reintroduced in 2015, and became law in November 2015.

On March 18, 2014, Rep. Brooks introduced the [[Cooperative and Small Employer Charity Pension Flexibility Act (H.R. 4275; 113th Congress)]]. The bill would allow some charities, schools, and volunteer organizations to remain exempt from [[pension]] plan rules under the [[Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974]] (ERISA) and the [[Internal Revenue Code]].<ref name=4275sum>{{cite web|title=H.R. 4275 – Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/4275|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=24 March 2014}}</ref><ref name=HouseExtends>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=House extends tax-free typhoon aid to Philippines|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/votes/201575-house-extends-tax-free-typhoon-aid-to-philippines|accessdate=25 March 2014|newspaper=The Hill|date=24 March 2014}}</ref> Brooks argued that the bill was needed because "some charities, schools and cooperatives are actually shutting down summer camps, cutting back on services to the community, or raising prices just to meet their pension obligations."<ref name="HouseExtends"/> The bill passed the House on March 24, 2014.

On July 29, 2015, Brooks introduced, along with Rep. [[Anna Eshoo]], the [[Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act of 2015]], H.R. 3299. The bill would streamline government decisions and provide incentives for vaccines and treatment of dangerous pathogens and diseases.<ref>{{cite news|title=Health Subcommittee holds markup on the Strengthening Public Health Emergency Response Act|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/18994-health-subcommittee-holds-markup-on-the-strengthening-public-health-emergency-response-act/|accessdate=2016-06-24|work=Homeland Preparedness News|date=2016-06-08}}</ref> Brooks sponsored the bill in response to a report released in October 2015 by the [[Blue Ribbon Study Panel on Biodefense]].<ref>[http://docs.house.gov/meetings/IF/IF14/20160519/104953/HHRG-114-IF14-20160519-SD002.pdf Memo to Members of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Health from the Majority Committee staff].

In February 2018, Brooks along with U.S. Rep. [[Anna Eshoo]] (D-CA) founded a new bipartisan caucus called the Congressional Biodefense Caucus. The group will work to focus in "improving the preparedness of the United States to respond to a pandemic or chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) threats." Brooks and Eshoo launched the caucus during a reception in Washington with more than 50 attendees from Congress and the biodefense industry.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/stories/27101-preparedness-u-s-congresswoman-brooks-says/|title=‘It’s all about preparedness,’ U.S. Congresswoman Brooks says|last=Riley|first=Kim|date=2018-03-02|work=Homeland Preparedness News|access-date=2018-03-23|language=en-US}}</ref>
