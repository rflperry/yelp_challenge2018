==United States House of Representatives==

===Elections===

====2008====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2008#District 25}}
Garcia announced on February 7, 2008, his candidacy for the U.S. Congress in {{ushr|FL|25}}. Garcia's campaign raised over $1.8 million but incumbent Republican U.S. Congressman [[Mario Diaz-Balart]] defeated Garcia 53%-47%.

====2010====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2010#District 25}}
In April 2010, Garcia announced his candidacy for the 25th district again, after U.S. Congressman [[Mario Diaz-Balart]] announced he would run for reelection in the [[Florida's 21st congressional district|21st District]] being vacated by his brother, [[Lincoln Diaz-Balart]]. In his campaign announcement, Garcia stated he would focus on job creation, funding education and health care as his top priorities. Garcia defeated Luis Meurice in the Democratic primary, 76%-24%.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=625366 ourcampaigns.com.com]; accessed November 15, 2014.</ref>{{Better source|date=October 2014}}

In the general election, Garcia faced State Representative [[David Rivera]], Tea Party activist Roly Arrojo, and Florida Whig Party nominee Craig Porter. Rivera defeated Garcia, 52%-43%, or a 9.5-point margin.<ref>[http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=488504 Ourcampaigns.com]; accessed November 15, 2014.</ref>{{Better source|date=October 2014}}<ref name="garciaconcedes">{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2010/11/03/1905749/joe-garcia-concedes-to-david-rivera.html|title=Joe Garcia concedes to David Rivera|author=Jaweed Kaleem|date=November 3, 2010|work=Miami Herald|accessdate=July 8, 2011}}</ref>

====2012====
{{see also|United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2012#District 26}}
In 2012, Garcia announced he would seek a rematch against Rivera in what was now the 26th district. It is more divided between Republicans and Democrats than its predecessor, the 25th district. It had been pushed well to the east and south, losing its share of [[Collier County]] and picking up all of [[Monroe County, Florida|Monroe County]], including the Keys. The race was widely expected to be much closer than in previous cycles, in part due to the new demographics, and due to [[David Rivera#Controversies|numerous scandals surrounding Rivera]]. In addition to several state probes, Rivera was the target of a federal investigation into allegations he tried to sabotage the Democratic primary in the 26th by secretly funding an unknown candidate, [[Lamar Sternad|Justin Lamar Sternad]], in hopes of avoiding a rematch against García. Several vendors whom Sternad employed in his campaign told the ''[[Miami Herald]]'' that Rivera had funded Sternad's campaign.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/08/21/2962351/campaign-vendors-say-republican.html|title=Campaign vendors say Republican Congressman David Rivera funded Democrat’s failed primary bid|first=Marc|last=Caputo|accessdate=September 9, 2012|date=August 21, 2012|publisher=Miami Herald}}</ref> Sternad himself subsequently told the FBI that Rivera had funded his campaign. Sternad's campaign manager, Ana Alliegro, was a close friend of Rivera. According to Sternad she served as the go-between.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2012/09/25/3021207/rivera-ran-secret-campaign-sternad.html|title=Rivera ran secret campaign, Sternad tells FBI|author1=Marc Caputo|author2=Manny Garcia|publisher=[[The Miami Herald]]|date=2012-09-25}}</ref>

Garcia won the rematch, defeating Rivera 54%–43%.<ref>{{cite web|title=THE TOP ELECTION 2012 HEADLINES FROM NBC 6 SOUTH FLORIDA AND NBC NEWS|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/election-2012/results-page|work=[[WTVJ]]|accessdate=November 8, 2012}}</ref> His election made him the first Cuban-American Democrat to represent South Florida in Congress.

In May 2013, Garcia's chief-of-staff and top political strategist went to jail after being implicated in a sophisticated scheme to manipulate the previous year’s primary elections by submitting hundreds of fraudulent absentee-ballot requests.<ref name=phantom>{{cite news|last=Mazzei|first=Patricia|date=May 31, 2013|title=Congressman Joe Garcia's chief of staff implicated in phantom absentee-ballot requests scheme|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/05/31/3426745/miami-congressman-joe-garcias.html#storylink=cpy|newspaper=Miami Herald|location=Miami, Florida|accessdate=November 15, 2014}}</ref>

He faced Republican nominee [[United States House of Representatives elections in Florida, 2014#District 26|Carlos Curbelo]] in the general election on November 4, 2014. According to a ''Washington Post'' article in December 2012, Garcia was one of the 10 most vulnerable incumbents in 2014.<ref>{{cite news|last1=Blake|first1=Aaron|title=House Democrats face long odds in 2014|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/the-fix/wp/2012/12/07/house-democrats-face-long-odds-in-2014|accessdate=August 11, 2014|publisher=Washington Post|date=December 7, 2012}}</ref> He was a member of the [[Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee]]'s Frontline Program, designed to help protect vulnerable Democratic incumbents heading into the 2014 election.<ref>{{cite news|title=DCCC Chairman Steve Israel Announces 2013-14 Frontline Members|url=http://dccc.org/newsroom/entry/dccc_chairman_steve_israel_announces_2013-2014_frontline_members|accessdate=August 11, 2014|publisher=Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee|date=March 5, 2013}}</ref> Nonetheless, Garcia lost to the Republican nominee [[Carlos Curbelo (politician)|Carlos Curbelo]].

On September 9, 2013, the ''Miami Herald'' reported the funding of a shill candidate during Garcia's 2010 campaign.
