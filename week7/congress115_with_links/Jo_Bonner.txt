==Early life, education, and early political career==

Bonner was born in [[Selma, Alabama]], but was reared in [[Camden, Alabama]],<ref>{{cite book |title=2014 Almanac of American Politics |last2=Barone |first2=Chuck |last1=McCutcheon|first1=Michael |publisher=The University of Chicago Press |year= 2013}}</ref> to Josiah Robins Bonner Sr. and the former Imogene Virginia Lyons.<ref>{{cite web |title= Rep.

Jo Bonner (R) |url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/person/jo-bonner-al/  |work=National Journal Almanac |publisher=[[National Journal]]}}</ref>

Two years later he started working as campaign press secretary for U.S. Congressman [[Sonny Callahan]], a Republican representing [[Alabama's 1st congressional district]]. In 1989, Bonner was promoted to Callahan's chief of staff and moved to [[Mobile, Alabama|Mobile]].<ref name="bio"/>

Bonner has served as a member of the board of directors for the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, [[Rotary International|Rotary]] Club, Leadership Mobile, and the Mobile Chapter of the University of Alabama Alumni Association. In 2000, the College of Communications at the University of Alabama honored him as their Outstanding Alumnus in Public Relations. He was a member of Leadership Mobile, Class of 2000, where his classmates elected him co-president.<ref name="official">{{cite web|url=http://bonner.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2164&Itemid=83|title=Congressman Jo Bonner, Biography|publisher=Jo Bonner's Congressional Website|accessdate=2012-02-24|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120514132047/http://bonner.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&view=article&id=2164&Itemid=83|archivedate=2012-05-14|df=}}</ref>

==U.S. House of Representatives==

===Elections===
;2002
Callahan did not run for reelection in 2002, and Bonner entered the race to succeed him. He ranked first in the crowded seven-way Republican primary with 40% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=87126 |title=AL District 1 - R Primary Race - Jun 04, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref> In the run-off election Bonner defeated Tom Young, chief of staff to [[U.S. Senator]] [[Richard Shelby]] 62%–38%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=87127 |title=AL District 1 - R Runoff Race - Jun 25, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref> In the general election, he defeated Democrat Judy Belk with 61% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=914 |title=AL District 01 Race - Nov 05, 2002 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref>  However, he had effectively clinched a seat in Congress with his primary victory.  The 1st is one of the most Republican districts in Alabama and the South, and has been in Republican hands without interruption since 1965.  Bonner was also endorsed by his predecessors, Callahan and [[Jack Edwards (American politician)|Jack Edwards]].

;2004&ndash;2010
During this time period, Bonner never won re-election with less than 63% of the vote.  He even ran unopposed in 2008 and 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=2529 |title=Candidate - Jo Bonner |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref>

;2012
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Alabama, 2012|#District 1}}

After redistricting, Bonner decided to run for a sixth term. In the Republican primary, he drew three opponents.<ref>[http://blog.al.com/live/2012/02/mobile_bar_polls_judicial_race.html ''Alabama Press-Register'' "Mobile Bar polls judicial races; new candidate in AL-01 (Political Skinny)" February 13, 2012]</ref>  For the third election in a row, no other party even put up a candidate, meaning that whoever won the primary would be all but assured of election.

An anti-incumbent super [[Political Action Committee|PAC]] called the [[Campaign for Primary Accountability]] spent $21,000 to try to unseat Bonner. Bonner told ''[[The New York Times]]'' that "obviously, when the Supreme Court made their decision to open up corporate war chests, this is the result." Bonner said he believed he would survive the primary challenge because his campaign expenditures far exceed the money being spent against him. "If I hadn't had $1 million in my account, I could be underwater right now," said Bonner.<ref>[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/08/us/politics/anti-incumbent-super-pac-adds-to-congresss-insecurity.html?_r=2 ''New York Times'', "‘Super PAC’ Increasing Congress’s Sense of Insecurity", March 8, 2012]</ref> According to [[Federal Election Commission]] records, Bonner spent $650,000 on his re-election campaign. His three opponents spent a combined total of under $275,000. No Democratic candidates have filed to run against Bonner in the general election.<ref>[http://blog.al.com/live/2012/03/post_173.html ''[[Press-Register|Alabama Press-Register]]'', "Rep. Jo Bonner wins GOP nomination for Alabama's 1st Congressional District", March 13, 2012]</ref>

Bonner won the Republican primary with 56% of the vote. He won all of the counties in the district.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=743052 |title=AL District 01 - R Primary Race - Mar 13, 2012 |publisher=Our Campaigns |date= |accessdate=2017-11-16}}</ref>

===Tenure===
Bonner was somewhat conservative by national standards, but moderate by Alabama Republican standards. Perhaps his most notable dissension was his opposition to on-shore [[liquefied natural gas]] (LNG) terminals for Mobile, but went on to propose an off-shore option for the future. He pushed for Callahan's seat on the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] but did not carry the support of his colleagues. Bonner hosted the [[Gulf Coast Congressional Report]] from 2003 to 2006, when the program was halted in response to an equal-time complaint by Vivian Beckerle, Bonner's opponent in the 2006 election.<ref>{{cite web|title=Watch Gulf Coast Congressional Report Free Online|url=http://www.ovguide.com/gulf-coast-congressional-report-9202a8c04000641f80000000055901f8#|publisher=[[OVGuide]]|accessdate=March 10, 2012}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Notes on Mobile & Baldwin Politics & Law|url=http://modmobilian.com/notes/notespolitics/|publisher=Mod Mobilian|accessdate=March 10, 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120714070111/http://modmobilian.com/notes/notespolitics/|archivedate=July 14, 2012|df=}}</ref>

Prior to being sworn into the 108th Congress, [[Majority Whip]] [[Roy Blunt]], a [[Missouri]] Republican, named Bonner an Assistant Whip. The appointment made Bonner one of a number of freshmen who were part of weekly leadership meetings with Blunt, the second-ranking member in the Republican Leadership behind only  the [[Majority Leader]]. On December 14, 2005, Bonner voted for the reauthorization of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]]. On June 29, 2005, he voted for a $25 million increase in funding for anti-[[Cannabis (drug)|marijuana]] print and television ads. On October 6, 2005, he voted for the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]]. On July 13, 2006, he was one of thirty-three votes against renewal of the [[Voting Rights Act]].<ref name="bio"/>

In December 2011, Bonner voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required Congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 [[Congressional Review Act]], would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.<ref name="wapo111207">{{cite news |first=Felicia |last=Sonmez |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |title=REINS bill to expand congressional power over executive regulations passed by House |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/2chambers/post/reins-bill-to-expand-congressional-power-over-executive-regulations-passed-by-house/2011/12/07/gIQAs6VMdO_blog.html |date=December 7, 2011 |accessdate=October 10, 2013}}</ref><ref name="FreedomWorks">{{cite web|title=FreedomWorks Scorecard|url=http://congress.freedomworks.org/legislators/jo-bonner-0}}</ref>

According to the website Open Congress, Bonner votes with the Republican Party 93.5% of the time. This ranked 88th among the 242 House Republicans in 2011.<ref>[http://www.opencongress.org/people/votes_with_party/house/republican ''Open Congress'' "Voting With Party," Accessed October 28, 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318112332/http://www.opencongress.org/people/votes_with_party/house/republican |date=March 18, 2012 }}</ref>

In 2008, following Bonner's appointment to the [[United States House of Representatives Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations Committee]], free-market advocacy group [[FreedomWorks]] called on Bonner to accept a personal one-year moratorium on accepting earmarks. A FreedomWorks statement said that "Representative Bonner has a long history of securing earmarks for his district, and voting in favor of egregious pork projects on the House floor."<ref>[http://www.freedomworks.org/press-releases/freedomworks-calls-on-rep-jo-bonner-r-al-to-take-p ''FreedomWorks'' "FreedomWorks Calls on Rep.

Bonner has declined to join the [[Tea Party Caucus]], saying, "I try not to get involved in caucuses that make me look like a radical, right-wing nut. I don't think that's what the Tea Party is, but I want to avoid the appearance."<ref>Talbot, George.
