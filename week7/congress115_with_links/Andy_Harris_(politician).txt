'''Andrew Peter Harris''' (born January 25, 1957) is an [[United States|American]] [[politician]] and [[physician]] who has been the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for {{ushr|MD|1}} since 2011. He is a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] and currently the only Republican member of Maryland's congressional delegation. Harris previously served in the [[Maryland Senate]].

==Early life, education, and career==
Harris's father was Zoltán Harris, an [[anesthesiologist]] who was born in [[Miskolc]], [[Hungary]], in 1911 and emigrated to the United States in 1950; his mother, Irene, was born in [[Poland]].<ref name="harris bio" /> He grew up in [[Queens]], New York, and attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[Manhattan]].<ref>{{cite journal | accessdate = November 30, 2016 | title = Mr. Harris Goes to Washington | work = Regis Alumni News | url = http://community.regis.org/netcommunity/document.doc?id=59 | pages= 10–11 | first = Mike | last = Memoli | volume = 75 | issue= 2 (Winter 2011)}}</ref>

Harris earned his B.S. in biology (1977) and his M.D. (1980) from [[The Johns Hopkins University]]. The University's Bloomberg School of Hygiene and Public Health conferred the M.H.S. in 1995 in [[Health policy and management]] and also Health Finance & Management.<ref name="harris bio">[https://harris.house.gov/about CongressmanAndy Harris: Biography]. Retrieved September 29, 2017.</ref>

Harris served in the [[Navy Medical Corps]] and the [[U.S. Naval Reserve]] as a lieutenant commander on active duty during [[Operation Desert Storm]] and currently serves as a commander.<ref name="harris bio"/> He has worked as an anesthesiologist, as an associate professor of anesthesiology and critical care medicine, and as chief of obstetric anesthesiology at the [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]]. Harris also served as commanding officer for the Johns Hopkins Naval Reserve Medical Unit from 1989 to 1992.<ref name="harris bio"/>

==Maryland General Assembly==
Harris was first elected to the [[Maryland Senate]] in 1998 for District 9 for [[Baltimore County]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.elections.state.md.us/elections/1998/results_1998/gasse.html |title=1998 Gubernatorial Election|author=Maryland State Board of Elections|work=state.md.us|accessdate=September 13, 2015}}</ref> He defeated his predecessor, Minority Leader [[F.

His district was later redrawn to be District 7, representing Baltimore County and [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]], succeeding [[Norman R.

===2008===

Harris defeated incumbent Republican [[Wayne Gilchrest]] and State Senator [[E.J. Pipkin]] in the [[United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2006|Republican primary]] for [[Maryland's 1st congressional district]].<ref name="2008 results"/> Harris ran well to the right of Gilchrest, one of the leading moderate Republicans in the House. He explained that he was upset with Gilchrest's decision to support a Democratic bill setting a timetable for [[troop withdrawal from Iraq]] and suspected that many of his constituents also felt that way. He was endorsed by the [[Club for Growth]],<ref>[http://andyharris08.org/news/club-for-growth-endorses-andy-harris.html Club for Growth Endorses Andy Harris] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928023915/http://andyharris08.org/news/club-for-growth-endorses-andy-harris.html |date=September 28, 2007 }} ''Andy Harris For Congress'' Press Release.

The November election was expected to be very close, even though the 1st is considered to be very Republican on paper. This was partly due to the district's geography.  Harris is from the Baltimore suburbs, while Kratovil was from the [[Eastern Shore of Maryland|Eastern Shore]], which is home to half the district's population. On election night, Kratovil led Harris by 915 votes. After two rounds of counting [[absentee ballot]]s, Kratovil's lead grew to 2,000 votes. Forecasting that it would be nearly impossible for Harris to close the gap, most media outlets declared Kratovil the winner on the night of November 7.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html|title=AP: Kratovil Winner Of 1st District Seat|publisher=WJZ-TV|accessdate=November 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081113215948/http://wjz.com/local/district.absentees.2.858564.html| archivedate= November 13, 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/#mapHMD/H/01|title=Maryland's 1st District |publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 8, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081107105721/http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/results/individual/| archivedate= November 7, 2008| deadurl= no}}</ref> Harris finally conceded on November 11. While Harris won the Baltimore suburbs handily, it was not enough to overcome his deficit on the Eastern Shore. [[John McCain]] won this district by 19 points, his best showing in the state.

===2010===
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2010#1st Congressional District*}}
Harris ran again in the 1st District in 2010. He defeated Rob Fisher, a conservative businessman, in the primary.

Harris's primary win set up a rematch against Kratovil. Libertarian Richard James Davis and Independent Jack Wilson also ran. In the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November 2 general election]], the district reverted to form, and Harris defeated Kratovil by 14 percent.

===2012===
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Maryland, 2012#District 1}}

The [[National Journal]]'s [[Cook Political Report]] named Harris one of the top 10 Republicans most vulnerable to redistricting in 2012, noting that Maryland Democrats could [[Redistricting|redraw]] Harris's home in Cockeysville out of the 1st.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415|title= Top 10 Republicans Most Vulnerable to Redistricting |author=David Wasserman and Julia Edwards|date=April 15, 2011|work=Cook Political Report|publisher=National Journal|accessdate=April 25, 2011 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110501045824/http://nationaljournal.com/top-10-republicans-most-vulnerable-to-redistricting-20110415| archivedate= May 1, 2011|deadurl= no}}</ref> Instead, [[Roscoe Bartlett]]'s district was redrawn so as to beat him.<ref>John Fritze, "Delaney Defeats Bartlett in the 6th District", ''Baltimore Sun'', November 7, 2012.</ref> Harris was a beneficiary of this remap, as the reconfigured 1st included Republican-leaning portions of Harford and Baltimore counties that had previously been in Bartlett's 6th district, making this already strongly Republican district even more so.

Harris skated to a second term, defeating Democratic challenger [[Wendy Rosen]] with 67 percent of the vote. Rosen had withdrawn from the race after being confronted with evidence that she'd voted in both Maryland and Florida in the 2006 and 2008 elections. Rosen had property in Florida, and Maryland law allowed property owners to vote in local elections even if they live elsewhere. However, her Florida voting registration reportedly also gave her access to state and federal elections there, something which was not allowed by Maryland law.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-wendy-rosen-withdraws-20120910,0,3764352.story|title=Democrat withdraws from 1st District congressional race after allegations she voted in two states|date=September 14, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|first=Matthew Hay|last=Brown}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2012-09-11/news/bs-ed-rosen-voter-fraud-20120911_1_voter-id-bill-voter-fraud-congressional-districts|title=The lesson of Wendy Rosen|date=September 11, 2012|accessdate=September 15, 2012|work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}</ref> By the time she pulled out, however, ballots had already been printed. John LaFerla, who had narrowly lost to Rosen in the primary, was endorsed as Rosen's replacement, but could only be a write-in.

===2014===

Harris defeated Democrat Bill Tilghman for a third term, taking over 70 percent of the vote—his best showing as a state or federal legislator.

===2016===
Harris ran for reelection in 2016. In the Republican primary, he faced three challengers and won 78.4 percent of the vote. Former Maryland state delegates member [[Michael D.

==Positions==

===Affordable Care Act===
Harris's prominence as a medical doctor in opposition to government-run health care made him a lightning rod for attacks by supporters of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care legislation]]. At a closed-door employee benefits briefing for new congressmen during the November 2010 freshman orientation, Harris was surprised to learn that the [[Federal Employees Health Benefits Program|Federal employee health benefit plan]] would leave the new congressmen and their staffers without coverage until the following pay period, 28 days after inauguration. Concerned about this gap in coverage, he asked whether new government employees could purchase temporary coverage to fill this gap. "This is the only employer I've ever worked for where you don't get coverage the first day you are employed," he said through his spokeswoman, Anna Nix.<ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2010/11/17/republican-rep-elect-refutes-claim-lost-congressional-health-care-rules/ | work=Fox News | title=Republican Rep.-Elect Refutes Claim He Lost It Over Congressional Health Care Rules | date=November 17, 2010}}</ref><ref>{{cite news| url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20022969-503544.html | work=CBS News | first=Stephanie | last=Condon | title=House GOP Freshman Demands Gov't Health Care | date=November 16, 2010}}</ref> Through a spokesman, his defeated opponent, Frank Kratovil, seized upon this dialogue, characterizing the question as a "demand" for special treatment and for access to the benefits he opposed in the new law.<ref>Paul West, "[http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-harris-health-care-20101116,0,4762295.story Rep.-elect Harris snagged in health care flap]," ''[[The Baltimore Sun]]'', Nov. 16, 2010.</ref> Furthermore, "Harris then asked if he could purchase insurance from the government to cover the gap," added an aide, who was struck by the similarity to Harris's request and the public option he denounced as a gateway to [[socialized medicine]].<ref>Glen Thrush, "[http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1110/45181.html GOP frosh: Where's my health care?]" ''[[Politico]]'', Nov. 15, 2010.</ref>

On October 16, 2013, Harris voted against the motion to end the government shutdown and raise the debt ceiling.<ref>Washington Post, October 16/17, 2013.  "Votes to end the government shutdown".</ref>

===Foreign affairs===
Harris has defended Hungarian leader [[Viktor Orban]], an ally of [[Vladimir Putin]] who has pledged to turn his country into an "illiberal democracy".

===Opposition to D.C. cannabis reform===
In 2014, Harris was the leading congressional critic of [[Decriminalization of non-medical cannabis in the United States#District of Columbia|marijuana decriminalization]] in the [[District of Columbia]] bill, and led efforts in Congress to block decriminalization from taking effect.<ref name="DavisO'Keefe">{{cite news|last1=Davis|first1=Aaron|last2=O'Keefe|first2=Ed|title=Congressional spending deal blocks pot legalization in D.C.|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/congressional-budget-deal-may-upend-marijuana-legalization-in-dc/2014/12/09/6dff94f6-7f2e-11e4-8882-03cf08410beb_story.html|website=washingtonpost.com|accessdate=10 December 2014|date=December 9, 2014}}</ref> Harris's amendment led to a call from D.C.

ATTN: wrote that according to medical studies, marijuana can reduce the adverse effects of chemotherapy in cancer patients, and substitute for the more dangerous opioids. In states where medical marijuana has been legalized, the number of pharmaceutical pain killers prescribed has dropped significantly.<ref>{{cite web|author=Matthew Segal |url=http://www.attn.com/stories/463/one-congressman-just-ruined-legalized-marijuana-dc-everyone-heres-why |title=One Congressman Just Ruined Legalized Marijuana in DC For Everyone.
