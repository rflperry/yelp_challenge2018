==Early life, education and private career==
Huizenga, born to a family of [[Dutch Americans]], is the current co-owner and operator of Huizenga Gravel Company, a third generation business located in [[Jenison, Michigan]]. He has been affiliated with it for most of his life.

In the early 1990s, Huizenga obtained his Michigan Real Estate sales license, and he quickly became one of the most successful realtors in southwest Michigan. He left real estate in 1996 when he was recruited by U.S. Representative [[Peter Hoekstra]] to be his Director of Public Policy. For six years, from 1996 through 2002, he traveled throughout western Michigan becoming familiar with the various towns and cities, and eventually decided to run for political office.

==Michigan House of Representatives==
Starting with his first election in 2002, Huizenga represented the 90th district for three terms, by winning reelection in 2004 and 2006. After the 2006 election he was [[Term limits in the United States|term limited]]. The district is located in [[Ottawa County, Michigan|Ottawa County]] and includes the cities of [[Holland, Michigan|Holland]], Zeeland, [[Hudsonville, Michigan|Hudsonville]], and the four townships of [[Blendon Township, Michigan|Blendon Township]], [[Jamestown Township, Michigan|Jamestown Township]], [[Holland Charter Township, Michigan|Holland Township]], and [[Zeeland Township, Michigan|Zeeland Township]].
