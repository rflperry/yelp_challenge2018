In 1998, Cassidy helped found the Greater Baton Rouge Community Clinic to provide uninsured residents of the greater [[Baton Rouge]] area with access to free health care. The Clinic provides low-income families with free dental, medical, [[mental health]] and vision care through a "virtual" approach that partners needy patients with doctors who provide care free of charge.<ref>Anderson, Laurie Smith.

==Early political career==
Cassidy was first elected to the Louisiana State Senate in 2006 as a Republican. He had previously been a Democrat, supporting [[Michael Dukakis]] for president [[United States presidential election, 1988|in 1988]] and donating to the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 1992|1992 presidential campaign]] of Senator [[Paul Tsongas]] (D-MA)<ref name="triestounite">{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/11/bill-cassidy-unite-louisiana-conservatives-99284.html|title=Bill Cassidy tries to unite Louisiana conservatives|author=Ginger Gibson|date=November 3, 2013|accessdate=January 5, 2015}}</ref><ref name="donatedtohis">{{cite web|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/7105510-125/cassidy-once-donated-to-his|title=Cassidy once donated to his rival|author=Ginger Gibson|accessdate=2014-05-31|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531165114/http://theadvocate.com/home/7105510-125/cassidy-once-donated-to-his|archivedate=May 31, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> and to Louisiana Democrats Governor [[Kathleen Blanco]] in 2003−04 and Senator [[Mary Landrieu]] in 2002. In 2013, Cassidy called his donation to Landrieu a "youthful indiscretion," saying that she "got elected and fell into partisan politics... Louisiana hasn't left Mary, Mary has left us." Since 2001, he has mostly contributed to Republican candidates, including Senator [[David Vitter]]. According to Cassidy, he switched parties after the extinction of conservative Democrats and because of his frustration with the bureaucracy and inefficiency of the public hospital system.<ref name="donatedtohis"/><ref>{{cite web|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/senate-races/323501-cassidy-donated-to-landrieus-first-reelection|title=Cassidy donated to Landrieu's first reelection|author=Cameron Joseph|date=2013-09-19|accessdate=2014-05-31}}</ref>

On December 9, 2006, Cassidy won a [[special election]] for the District 16 seat in the Louisiana Senate. In his first bid for public office, Cassidy defeated veteran [[Louisiana State Legislature|State Representative]] William Daniel, a fellow Republican, and [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian]] candidate S.B. Zaitoon. The election was held to replace [[Jay Dardenne]], who vacated the seat he had held since 1992 upon his election as Louisiana Secretary of State. Cassidy was sworn in on December 20, 2006. On October 20, 2007, Cassidy was reelected, to a full four-year term in the Louisiana State Senate. Cassidy received 76% of the vote against Republican Troy "Rocco" Moreau (15%) and Libertarian Richard Fontanesi (9%). {{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Jackson. Jackson, who is African-American, finished third with 36,100 votes, more than the 25,000-vote margin separating Cassidy and Cazayoux.

In May 2013, Cassidy introduced the [[Energy Consumers Relief Act of 2013]] ({{USBill|113|hr|1582}}) to require the [[Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to submit reports to both the [[United States Congress]] and the [[United States Department of Energy]] regarding proposed regulation that would have significant compliance costs (an impact of over $1 billion).<ref name=cbo1582>{{cite web|title=CBO – 1582|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44443|publisher=United States Congres|accessdate=July 25, 2013}}</ref><ref name=Energybillsadvance>{{cite news|last=Kasperowicz|first=Pete|title=Energy bills advance with House vote|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/313223-energy-bills-advance-with-house-vote|accessdate=July 26, 2013|newspaper=The Hill|date=July 24, 2013}}</ref> The Department of Energy and Congress would then have the option of stopping or altering the EPA proposal.<ref name="cbo1582"/>

In 2013, due to the [[American Medical Association]]'s decision to officially recognize [[obesity]] as a disease, Senators and Representatives, including Cassidy, helped introduce legislation to lower health care costs and prevent [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic diseases]] by addressing America's growing obesity crisis. Cassidy said the '''Treat and Reduce Obesity Act''' could help empower physicians to use all methods and means to fight the condition.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.benzinga.com/news/13/06/3690006/senators-carper-murkowski-representatives-cassidy-kind-introduce-bill-to-help-red#ixzz2X4K9KwPV|title=Senators Carper, Murkowski, Representatives Cassidy, Kind Introduce Bill to Help Reduce Obesity|last1=Gross|first1=Charles|date=June 19, 2013|publisher=Benzinga|accessdate=July 16, 2013}}</ref>

In 2014 Cassidy co-sponsored an amendment to the Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act in 2014 to limit annual premium increases for flood insurance, reinstate the flood insurance program's grandfathering provision, and eliminate a provision that required an increase to actuarial levels when a home is sold.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.nola.com/politics/index.ssf/2014/03/will_flood_insurance_bill_get.html|title=Will flood insurance bill get a vote this week?|date=2014-03-12|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=The Times-Picayune|first=Bruce|last=Alpert}}</ref>

Cassidy was a vocal opponent of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] (commonly called Obamacare or the Affordable Care Act), arguing that it would fail to lower costs and give too much decision-making authority to the federal government.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://theadvocate.com/home/5997068-125/cassidy-blasts-obamacare|title=Cassidy blasts Obamacare|date=2013-05-17|accessdate=2014-04-29|newspaper=The Advocate|first=Jordan|last=Blum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502002018/http://theadvocate.com/home/5997068-125/cassidy-blasts-obamacare|archivedate=May 2, 2014|df=mdy-all}}</ref> In September 2014, the House passed the [[Employee Health Care Protection Act of 2013 (H.R. 3522; 113th Congress)]], sponsored by Cassidy, enabling Americans to keep health insurance policies that do not meet all of the Affordable Care Act's requirements.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/217440-house-passes-bill-allowing-people-to-keep-health-plans | title=House ok's Cassidy's 'keep your plan' bill|date=2014-09-11|publisher=The Hill|first=Cristina|last=Marcos}}</ref> In March 2017, Cassidy sent a letter to one of his constituents that falsely asserted that Obamacare "allows a presidentially handpicked 'Health Choices Commissioner' to determine what coverage and treatments are available to you."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.propublica.org/article/we-fact-checked-lawmakers-letters-to-constituents-on-health-care|title=We Fact-Checked Lawmakers' Letters to Constituents on Health Care|last=Ornstein|first=Charles|date=2017-03-22|work=ProPublica|access-date=2017-03-22|language=en}}</ref>

The "Graham-Cassidy" bill would eliminate the ACA's [[Health insurance marketplace|marketplace]] subsidies, repeal the ACA's [[Medicaid expansion]], and introduce a temporary block grant that would expire in 2026.<ref name="Garfield">Rachel Garfield, Larry Levit, Robin Rudowitz & Gary Claxton, [http://www.kff.org/health-reform/issue-brief/state-by-state-estimates-of-changes-in-federal-spending-on-health-care-under-the-graham-cassidy-bill/ State-by-State Estimates of Changes in Federal Spending on Health Care Under the Graham-Cassidy Bill], [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] (September 21, 2017).</ref> The legislation would also impose a per-enrollee cap on [[Medicaid]] funding.<ref name="Garfield"/> The [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] noted that the legislation "would fundamentally alter the current federal approach to financing health coverage for more than 80 million people who have coverage through the ACA (Medicaid expansion or marketplace) or through the traditional Medicaid program."<ref name="Garfield"/> An analysis by the [[Center for Budget and Policy Priorities]] found that the legislation "would cut federal health care funding by $299 billion relative to current law" in the year 2027 alone and estimated that it would leave 32 million more Americans [[Health insurance coverage in the United States|without health insurance]].<ref>Edwin Parks & Matt Broaddus, [https://www.cbpp.org/research/health/cassidy-graham-plans-damaging-cuts-to-health-care-funding-would-grow-dramatically-in Cassidy-Graham Plan’s Damaging Cuts to Health Care Funding Would Grow Dramatically in 2027], Center for Budget and Policy Priorities (revised September 20, 2017).</ref> President [[Donald Trump]] endorsed the bill.<ref>Lauren Fox, [http://www.cnn.com/2017/09/21/politics/deadline-graham-cassidy-health-care-bill/index.html The one major reason Graham-Cassidy could pass], CNN (September 21, 2017).</ref> The bill does not meet the "Jimmy Kimmel test", as it would allow states to eliminate requirements to cover children with conditions like that of Kimmel's child.<ref name=":0" /> Kimmel condemned Cassidy, calling him a liar,<ref name=":0" /> listed the health organizations that opposed Graham-Cassidy, and urged his viewers to contact their Congressional representatives about the legislation.<ref name=":0" /> Cassidy responded to Kimmel, saying that Kimmel "doesn't understand" the legislation.<ref name=":1">{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2017/09/21/sen-cassidys-rebuttal-to-jimmy-kimmel-more-people-will-have-coverage/|title=Analysis {{!}} Sen.
