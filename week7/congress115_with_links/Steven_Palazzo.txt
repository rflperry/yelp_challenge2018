====2010====
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Mississippi, 2010#District 4}}
Palazzo entered the Republican primary for [[Mississippi's 4th congressional district]] and won the nomination with 57% of the vote. He faced 10-term Democratic incumbent [[Gene Taylor (Mississippi)|Gene Taylor]] in the general election. 

Although the 4th had turned almost solidly Republican at the federal level, Taylor held the seat without serious difficulty from 1996 onward. His voting record had been very conservative even by [[Mississippi Democratic Party|Mississippi Democratic]] standards, and he'd often broken with his party. Palazzo established himself as Taylor's strongest opponent since 1996. In particular, he attacked Taylor for supporting [[Nancy Pelosi]] for House Speaker in 2006 and 2008.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1010/44119.html|title=Taylor: I voted for McCain – Jessica Taylor|publisher=Politico.Com|accessdate=2010-11-03}}</ref> He was endorsed by [[Sarah Palin]] and in the November 2010 general election, Palazzo defeated Taylor 52%–47%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=496790 |title=MS – District 04 Race – Nov 02, 2010 |publisher=Ourcampaigns.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-14}}</ref>

====2016====
In the Republican primary, Palazzo ran unopposed for the first time in his political career.  On November 8, Palazzo garnered 65.2% of the vote defeating Democrat Mark Gladney and two minor candidates.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/2016-election/results/map/house/mississippi/ |title=2016 Mississippi House Election Results|date=2016-11-11 |accessdate=2016-11-12}}</ref>

Prior to the 2016 general election, Libertarian challenger Ric McCluskey accused Palazzo of not being truthful about his service in the National Guard, claiming Palazzo failed to show up for mandatory drills.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.myfox23.com/single-post/2016/11/01/Ric-McCluskey-claims-Palazzo-went-AWOL-during-National-Guard|title=myfox23.com|website=myfox23.com|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>  

Mississippi State Representative [[David Baria]], a Democrat, sent a letter to the National Guard inquiring them to looking into Palazzo’s hours of service.

Palazzo denied the claims, stating, "This is a ridiculous accusation and a desperate attempt to smear a soldier’s service solely for political gain."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://wxxv25.com/2016/10/28/national-guard-looks-claims-congressman-steven-palazzo/|title=National Guard Looks into Claims against Congressman Steven Palazzo |date=2016-10-28|work=WXXV 25|access-date=2017-10-24}}</ref>

Rose claimed the documents revealed Palazzo fraudulently sought discharge from the National Guard, based on false claims of financial, family, and community hardships.
