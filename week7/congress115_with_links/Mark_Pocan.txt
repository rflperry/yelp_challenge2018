'''Mark William Pocan''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|k|æ|n}}; born August 14, 1964) is an American politician and businessman serving as the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] for [[Wisconsin's 2nd congressional district]] since 2013. The district is based in the state capital, [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]]. A member of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], he currently serves as Co-Chair of both the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]], as well as the [[Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus]].

==Early life, education, and early career==
Pocan was born and raised in [[Kenosha, Wisconsin]]. He graduated from Harvey Elementary School, Washington Junior High School, and [[Mary D. Bradford High School]] in 1982. He attended the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]], earning a bachelor's degree in [[journalism]] in 1986.

Shortly after graduating, Pocan opened up his own small business, a [[printing]] company named Budget Signs & Specialties, which he continues to own and run as of 2012. He is a member of the [[AFL-CIO]], which he joined as a small business owner.<ref name="weier">{{citation |title=UW Student Challenges Rep.

His active years at UW-Madison in College Democrats led to his election in 1991 to the [[Dane County, Wisconsin|Dane County Board of Supervisors]] where he served Madison’s downtown community for three terms, leaving the board in 1996. Pocan later served as a member of the [[Wisconsin State Assembly]] from 1999 to 2013, representing the 78th district.<ref>''[[Wisconsin Blue Book]] 2011-2012''. p. 71.</ref> In November 2012, Pocan won the [[general election]] to replace [[Tammy Baldwin]], who declined to run for reelection to instead run for the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]. He had also succeeded Baldwin in the State Assembly.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.chron.com/news/article/Mark-Pocan-wins-Madison-area-US-House-race-4015462.php|title=Mark Pocan wins Madison-area US House race, keeping Baldwin's vacated seat with Democrats|work=chron.com|accessdate=9 November 2012}}</ref>

===Elections===
In 1998, Pocan's longtime friend and ally, [[Tammy Baldwin]], gave up her seat in the Wisconsin State Assembly to make a successful run for Congress. Pocan ran to succeed her in the state legislature and won a three-way [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] primary with 54% of the vote. He faced no [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] opponent in the general election and won with 93% of the vote against an independent. He won re-election in 2000 with 81%--the only time he faced a Republican challenger. He was unopposed for reelection from 2002 to 2010.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=44761|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Mark Pocan|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>

===Tenure===
During his time as a state legislator, Pocan earned a reputation for moving the Wisconsin political debate to the left.  One of the most outspoken progressive members of the state assembly, Pocan focused on difficult issues including corrections reform, the state budget, education funding, and fighting privatization schemes.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

For six years Pocan sat on the state’s powerful budget writing Joint Finance Committee, including a term as co-chair. He also took on a leading role among Assembly Democrats, running caucus campaign efforts in 2008 when Democrats went from five seats down to successfully retaking the majority for the party for the first time in 14 years.

*'''[[Congressional LGBT Equality Caucus]]'''

== Political activism ==
Pocan identifies as a [[Progressivism in the United States|progressive]] Democrat, and is a member of a number of organizations, including Wisconsin Citizens Action, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], Fair Wisconsin<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.fairwisconsin.com|title=Fair Wisconsin – Advancing, achieving and protecting equality for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) Wisconsinites.|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref> and Midwest Progressive Elected Officials Network. Pocan is also one of the few progressive Democrats to have joined the [[American Legislative Exchange Council]] (ALEC), a conservative-leaning organization that produces model legislative proposals. Pocan used his membership to investigate the organization's agenda and sponsors and wrote a series of articles on his experiences with ALEC for the Madison-based magazine ''[[The Progressive]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.progressive.org/pocan0308.html|title="Inside ALEC" - The Progressive|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>{{When|date=August 2008}}  On the September 29, 2012 edition of ''[[Moyers and Company]]'', Pocan said "ALEC is a corporate dating service for lonely legislators and corporate special interests that eventually the relationship culminates with some special interest legislation and hopefully that lives happily ever after as the ALEC model. Unfortunately what’s excluded from that equation is the public."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://billmoyers.com/episode/full-show-united-states-of-alec/|title=United States of ALEC - Moyers & Company - BillMoyers.com|publisher=|accessdate=28 July 2016}}</ref>

== Personal life ==
Pocan is [[coming out|openly gay]]. He credits his political activism in part to an incident soon after he graduated from college and opened his printing business, when he was followed by two men after he left a gay bar, and was beaten with a baseball bat while they called him "faggot" and other slurs. This [[gaybashing]] incident spurred him to become active in the Madison LGBT community.<ref>Pocan, Mark. "A Seat at the Table" ''Our Lives'' March/April 2012; p. 23</ref> Pocan is notable for having been the only openly gay member of the state Assembly after [[Tammy Baldwin]]'s election to Congress, and was one of three LGBT members of the [[100th Wisconsin Legislature]],<ref name="weier" /> alongside Sen. [[Tim Carpenter]] (D–[[Milwaukee, Wisconsin|Milwaukee]]) and bisexual Rep. [[JoCasta Zamarripa]] (D–Milwaukee).

On November 24, 2006, Pocan and his long-term partner, Philip Frank, were legally married in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]].<ref name="conklin">{{citation |title=Gay Legislator's Marriage Is About Being A Couple |periodical=[[Wisconsin State Journal]] |url=http://host.madison.com/news/gay-legislator-s-marriage-is-about-being-a-couple/article_512c34e0-a0c7-5901-9e87-c95532269f24.html |date=December 13, 2006 |first=Melanie |last=Conklin |accessdate=2008-03-12 }}</ref>
