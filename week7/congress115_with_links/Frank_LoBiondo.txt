In November 2017, LoBiondo announced that he would retire from [[United States Congress|Congress]] at the end of his current term, and not seek re-election in [[United States House of Representatives elections in New Jersey, 2018|2018]].<ref>{{cite news |last=Giaritelli |first=Anna |date=November 7, 2017 |title=GOP Rep.

==Early political career==
LoBiondo served on the [[Cumberland County, New Jersey|Cumberland County]] [[Board of Chosen Freeholders]] from 1985 to 1987.
