===Party leadership===
{{BLP unsourced section|date=February 2017}}
Ruppersberger was the first Democratic freshman to be appointed to the House Intelligence Committee. He was named to this committee because his district is home to the [[National Security Agency]]. From January 3, 2011 to January 3, 2015, he served as this committee's ranking Democrat. The position placed Ruppersberger on the elite "Gang of Eight", which refers to the chairs and ranking members of the House and Senate Intelligence Committees along with the Senate majority leader, Senate minority leader, House speaker and House minority leader. By law, the president must keep the Gang of Eight informed of the country's most secret intelligence activities to maintain proper oversight.

===Shock trauma===
Ruppersberger decided to run for office after a near-fatal car accident while investigating a drug trafficking case. Ruppersberger survived and began campaigning. He served as vice chairman on the board of visitors for the hospital which saved his life. He also serves on the United States Naval Academy Board of Visitors.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

===Operation Hero Miles===
In 2003, Ruppersberger created the national "Hero Miles" program to allow Americans to donate their frequent flyer miles to wounded warriors recovering at military or [[Veterans Administration]] medical centers as well as to friends and family visiting them. In 2012, he authored legislation expanding the program to enable Americans to donate their hotel reward points to military families. Both the "Hero Miles" and "Hotels for Heroes" programs are administered by Fisher House, a nonprofit organization that opens its homes to military families visiting their injured loved ones at hospitals across the country.<ref name=wbal_tv>{{cite web|title=Ruppersberger Receives Medal For 'Operation Hero Miles'|url=http://www.wbaltv.com/travelgetaways/3853008/detail.html|work=[[WBAL-TV]]|accessdate=August 17, 2011}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> He won a [[Charles Dick Medal of Merit]] in 2004 for this initiative, thus becoming the last Marylander to win this award, which was previously awarded to U.S. Rep. [[Beverly Byron]] (1992), State Senator John Astle (1993), U.S. Senator [[Barbara Mikulski]] (1994), U.S. Rep. [[Roscoe Bartlett]] (1998) and State Delegate (now State Comptroller) Peter Franchot (1999).

===Municipal finance===
Ruppersberger is an advocate of municipal finance and tax-exempt municipal bonds. In 2013, he joined with Congressman Randy [[Randy Hultgren|Hultgren]] in securing the signatures of 137 other House Republicans and Democrats in a letter to congressional leaders asking that they "reject any proposal to cap or eliminate the deduction on tax-exempt municipal bonds used to finance the vast majority of infrastructure projects in America’s communities."<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hultgren.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hultgren-ruppersberger-lead-bipartisan-effort-to-keep-municipal-bonds-tax|title=Hultgren, Ruppersberger Lead Bipartisan Effort to Keep Municipal Bonds Tax-Exempt|date=July 11, 2013|newspaper=Congressman Randy Hultgren|accessdate=February 22, 2017}}</ref> The two circulated a similar letter in 2015<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://hultgren.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/hultgren-ruppersberger-lead-bipartisan-effort-to-protect-municipal-finance|title=Hultgren, Ruppersberger Lead Bipartisan Effort to Protect Municipal Finance Tax Exemption|date=April 15, 2015|newspaper=Congressman Randy Hultgren|access-date=February 22, 2017|language=en}}</ref> and formed the Municipal Finance Caucus in 2016.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://ruppersberger.house.gov/newsroom/press-releases/ruppersberger-hultgren-launch-bipartisan-caucus-to-promote-investment-in|title=Ruppersberger, Hultgren Launch Bipartisan Caucus to Promote Investment in Local Communities|date=March 1, 2016|newspaper=Congressman C.A.

===Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act===
Ruppersberger, along with Michigan Republican [[Mike Rogers (Michigan politician)|Mike Rogers]], co-sponsored the [[Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act]], designed to increase intelligence sharing between private cyber security firms and government agencies.<ref>{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/11/us-cybersecurity-congress-idUSBRE8391FY20120411|work=Reuters|title=House to take up cybersecurity bill with revisions | date=April 11, 2012}}</ref> More than 60 businesses and trade organizations submitted letters of support including the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Time Warner, Verizon and AT&T, IBM and Intel.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://intelligence.house.gov/hr-624-letters-support|title=H.R. 624 - Letters of Support &#124; The Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|publisher=Intelligence.house.gov|accessdate=August 13, 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140813111335/http://intelligence.house.gov/hr-624-letters-support|archivedate=August 13, 2014|df=}}</ref> Despite several amendments to address privacy concerns, some groups, such as the Electronic Frontier Foundation, have criticized the act for a lack of civil liberties protections, claiming that it authorizes government surveillance of private communications and allows companies to hand over large amounts of personal information on their clients without a warrant or judicial oversight, and thereby creates a cybersecurity loophole in existing privacy laws, such as the Wiretap Act and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/deeplinks/2012/04/cybersecurity-bill-faq-disturbing-privacy-dangers-cispa-and-how-you-stop-it |title=CISPA is Back: FAQ on What it is and Why it's Still Dangerous &#124; Electronic Frontier Foundation|publisher=Eff.org|date=February 25, 2013|accessdate=August 13, 2014}}</ref> CISPA passed the House of Representatives on April 26, 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2012/roll192.xml |format=XML |title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 192 |website=Clerk.house.gov |accessdate=February 27, 2017}}</ref> It was reintroduced into the House on February 13, 2013, and passed on April 18, 2013, by a bipartisan vote of 288-127. Of the 92 Democrats who supported the bill, many of them cited significant privacy improvements over the 2012 version.<ref>[https://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr624] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130422123824/http://www.gop.gov/bill/113/1/hr624|date=April 22, 2013}}</ref>

=== Biosecurity ===
On October 19, 2017 at the [[Emergent BioSolutions|Emergent Biosolutions]] manufacturing facility in Maryland, Ruppersberger received the Congressional Biosecurity Champion Award from the [[Alliance for Biosecurity]], a D.C.-based public-interest organization, for "his leadership and actions taken in Congress to improve U.S. national security, preparedness and response for [[biosecurity]] threats." He was one of eight Members of Congress that received the award.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://homelandprepnews.com/featured/24896-alliance-biosecurity-hails-rep-ruppersbergers-champion-efforts-around-bioterrorism-prevention/|title=Alliance for Biosecurity hails Rep.

==Political campaigns==
{{more citations needed|section|date=February 2017}}
Barred from a third term as county executive, Ruppersberger opted to run for Congress in 2002 after 2nd District Congressman [[Bob Ehrlich]] made what turned out to be a successful run for [[governor of Maryland|governor]]. The [[Maryland General Assembly]] significantly altered the 2nd by shifting most of its share of Harford County to the 1st and 6th Districts. In its place, the legislature added a heavily Democratic portion of Baltimore City that had previously been in the 1st District. This turned the 2nd from a swing district into a strongly Democratic district.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

An August 2011 editorial by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' described the 2nd district as "curlicue territories strung together by impossibly delicate tendrils of land" and "a crazy-quilt confection drawn for the express purpose of ousting the incumbent at the time, Rep. (and later Gov.) Robert L. "Bob" Ehrlich Jr., a Republican, and installing C.A. Dutch Ruppersberger, a Democrat who still holds the job."<ref name=wpostAug2011>{{cite news|title=Maryland Democrats redraw the congressional district map|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/maryland-democrats-redraw-the-congressional-district-map/2011/08/16/gIQATbwfSJ_story.html|accessdate=August 22, 2011|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|date=August 20, 2011}}</ref>  He defeated [[United States Republican Party|Republican]] opponent [[Helen Delich Bentley]], who had represented the 2nd district from 1985 to 1995, with 55 percent of the vote. He has never faced another close contest since then and has been reelected seven times.

On April 10, 2013, the ''Baltimore Sun'' reported that Ruppersberger was considering a run for [[governor of Maryland]] in 2014.<ref name=baltosunApr2013>{{cite news|title=Ruppersberger considering run for Governor|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-rodricks-0411-20130410,0,2390272.column|accessdate=April 11, 2013|newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]]|date=April 10, 2013}}</ref> In January 2014, he announced that he would not run for governor, but instead would seek reelection to the House of Representatives.<ref name="WBAL.comJan2014">{{cite news|title=Congressman Ruppersberger Decides Against Run For Governor|url=http://www.wbal.com/article/104985/2/congressman-ruppersberger-decides-against-run-for-governor|accessdate=February 22, 2017|website=wbal.com|date=January 22, 2014}}</ref>
