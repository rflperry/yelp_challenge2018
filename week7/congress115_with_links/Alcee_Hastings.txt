===1970 U.S. Senate election===

{{See also|United States Senate elections, 1970}}
Hastings decided to run for [[United States Senate]] in 1970 after incumbent [[Spessard Holland]] decided to retire. He failed to win the Democratic primary, or make the run-off election. He ranked fourth out of five candidates, receiving 13% of the vote. Governor [[Farris Bryant]] ranked first with 33% of the vote. [[Lawton Mainor Chiles, Jr.|Lawton Chiles]] ranked second with 26% of the vote. Chiles defeated Bryant in the run-off election and won the November general election.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=236084|title=Our Campaigns - FL US Senate - D Primary Race - Sep 08, 1970|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref>

==Judicial career (1977–1989)==

In 1977, Hastings became a judge of the circuit court of [[Broward County, Florida|Broward County]], Florida.

Hastings was nominated by President [[Jimmy Carter]] on August 28, 1979, to the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida]], to a new seat authorized by 92 Stat. 1629. He was confirmed by the [[United States Senate]] on October 31, 1979, and received his commission on November 2, 1979. His service was terminated on October 20, 1989, due to impeachment and conviction.

===Allegations and impeachment===

In 1981, Hastings was charged with accepting a $150,000 bribe in exchange for a lenient sentence and a return of seized assets for 21 counts of [[racketeering]] by Frank and Thomas Romano, and of perjury in his testimony about the case. In 1983, he was acquitted by a jury after his alleged co-conspirator, William Borders, refused to testify in court, resulting in a jail sentence for Borders.<ref>[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fW8aAAAAIBAJ&sjid=5CkEAAAAIBAJ&pg=3890,2277600&dq=alcee+hastings+acquitted "Federal Judge Acquitted"] ''Milwaukee Journal'', Feb. 4, 1983</ref>

In 1988, the Democratic-controlled [[United States House of Representatives]] took up the case, and Hastings was [[Impeachment in the United States|impeached]] for bribery and [[perjury]] by a vote of 413–3. He was then convicted on October 20, 1989 by the [[United States Senate]], becoming the sixth federal judge in the history of the [[impeachment in the United States|United States]] to be removed from office by the Senate. The Senate, in two hours of roll calls, voted on 11 of the 17 articles of impeachment. It convicted Hastings of eight of the 11 articles. The vote on the first article was 69 for and 26 opposed.<ref name="Senate Removes Hastings"/>

The Senate had the option to forbid Hastings from ever seeking federal office again, but did not do so. Alleged co-conspirator attorney William Borders went to jail again for refusing to testify in the impeachment proceedings, but was later given a full pardon by President [[Bill Clinton]] on his last day in office.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1066080426784 |title=The Power of the Pardon |publisher=Law.com |date=2011-07-15 |accessdate=2011-07-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090216112646/http://www.law.com/jsp/article.jsp?id=1066080426784| archivedate=February 16, 2009<!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no}}</ref>

Hastings filed suit in federal court claiming that his impeachment trial was invalid because he was tried by a Senate committee, not in front of the full Senate, and that he had been acquitted in a criminal trial. Judge [[Stanley Sporkin]] ruled in favor of Hastings, remanding the case to the Senate, but stayed his ruling pending the outcome of an appeal to the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in a similar case regarding Judge [[Walter Nixon]], who had also been impeached and removed.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/politics/campaigns/junkie/links/hastings091892.htm |title=Senate Conviction of Hastings Is Reversed by Judge Sporkin |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=1992-09-18 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}</ref>

Sporkin found some "crucial distinctions"<ref>''[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=Hastings+v.+U.S.,+802+F.Supp.+490&hl=en&as_sdt=6,37&case=15535651293027319741&scilh=0 Hastings v. U.S., 802 F.Supp. 490]''</ref> between Nixon's case and Hastings', specifically, that Nixon had been convicted criminally, and that Hastings was not found guilty by two-thirds of the committee who actually "tried" his impeachment in the Senate. He further added that Hastings had a right to trial by the full Senate.

The Supreme Court, however, ruled in ''[[Nixon v. United States]]'' that the federal courts have no jurisdiction over Senate impeachment matters, so Sporkin's ruling was vacated and Hastings's conviction and removal were upheld.<ref>''[http://www.leagle.com/decision/1993840837FSupp3_1839.xml HASTINGS v. U.S.]'' 837 F.Supp. 3 (1993)</ref>

==1990 Secretary of State election==

Hastings attempted to make a political comeback by running for [[Secretary of State of Florida]], campaigning on a platform of legalizing [[casino]]s. In a three-way Democratic primary, he placed second with 33% of the vote, behind newspaper columnist Jim Minter's 38% of the vote. In the [[runoff election|runoff]], which saw a large dropoff in turnout, Minter defeated him, 67%–33%. He won just one of [[List of counties in Florida|Florida's 67 counties]]: [[Miami-Dade County, Florida|Miami-Dade]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=376672|title=Our Campaigns - FL Secretary of State - D Runoff Race - Oct 02, 1990|website=www.ourcampaigns.com}}</ref> Minter went on to lose in the general election to incumbent Republican [[James C. Smith]].

==U.S. House of Representatives (1993–present)==

===Elections===

Hastings was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1992, representing [[Florida's 23rd congressional district|Florida's 23rd district]]. After placing second in the initial Democratic primary for the post, he scored an upset victory over state representative [[Lois J. Frankel]] in the runoff and went on to easily win election in the heavily-Democratic district. From that point on he has yet to face a serious challenge for reelection. Subsequent to redistricting and the 2012 election, Alcee Hastings represents [[Florida's 20th congressional district|Florida's 20th district]] beginning January 2013.

===Tenure===

Hastings is a member of the [[Congressional Black Caucus]]<ref>{{cite web|title=Membership|author=|url=https://cbc.house.gov/membership/|format=|publisher=Congressional Black Caucus|date=|accessdate=7 March 2018}}</ref> and was elected president of the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe|Parliamentary Assembly]] of the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe]] in July 2004. Today, as a senior Democratic whip, Hastings is an influential member of the Democratic leadership. Hastings is also a member of the powerful [[United States House Committee on Rules|House Rules Committee]] and is a senior member of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]] (HPSCI). On the HPSCI, Hastings is the chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.

He was one of the 31 who voted in the House not to count the [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] from [[Ohio]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 presidential election]].<ref>http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2005/roll007.xml</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050112072650/http://clerk.house.gov:80/evs/2005/roll007.xml|title=109 1st U.S. House of Representatives MOTION On Agreeing to the Objection|last=|first=|date=2005-01-12|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-03-27}}</ref>

Hastings voted to impeach Texas federal judge [[Samuel B.

===Bid for chairmanship of the House Intelligence Committee===

After the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2006|2006 United States House of Representatives elections]], Hastings attracted attention after it was reported that incoming [[U.S. Speaker of the House|House Speaker]] [[Nancy Pelosi]] might appoint him as head of the [[United States House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence|House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. He had support from the [[Congressional Black Caucus]], but was opposed by the [[Blue Dog Coalition]]. Hastings attacked his critics as “misinformed fools.” Pelosi reportedly favored Hastings instead of the ranking Democrat [[Jane Harman]] due to policy differences and support by the Congressional Black Caucus.<ref>[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/15741999/ns/politics-tom_curry/t/battle-hastings-adds-pelosi-drama/#.T2IOhHngFv0  Battle of Hastings adds to Pelosi drama] MSNBC, Nov. 16, 2006</ref> On November 28, 2006, Pelosi announced that Hastings would not be the Committee's chairman,<ref>[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6550628 Pelosi Shuts Hastings Out of Intel Chairmanship] NPR, Nov. 28, 2006</ref> and later she chose [[Silvestre Reyes]] (D-TX) instead. While Hastings was passed over to chair the committee, he became chair of a sub-committee. He told the [[National Journal]] that “I am not angry. At some point along the way, it became too much to explain. That is legitimate politics. But it’s unfortunate for me.”<ref>http://www.nationaljournal.com/almanac/2010/person/alcee-hastings-fl/</ref>

===Comments about Sarah Palin===

On September 24, 2008, Hastings came under fire for comments he made regarding [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] vice-presidential candidate [[Sarah Palin]]. Hastings, speaking in [[Washington D.C.]] to a conference sponsored by the [[National Jewish Democratic Council]], said "If Sarah Palin isn't enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with [[Barack Obama]], then you damn well had better pay attention. Anybody toting guns and stripping moose don't care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks. So, you just think this through." <ref>{{cite web|author=Anderson, Rigel  |url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2008/09/florida-congres/ |title=Florida Congressman: Palin 'Don't Care Too Much What They Do With Jews and Blacks' – Political Radar |publisher=Blogs.abcnews.com |date=2008-09-24 |accessdate=2010-08-23}}</ref>

On September 29, 2008, Hastings issued an apology via a written statement, while standing by its core message: "I regret the comments I made last Tuesday that were not smart and certainly not relevant to hunters or sportsmen. The point I made, and will continue to make, is that the policies and priorities of a McCain-Palin administration would be anathema to most African Americans and Jews. I regret that I was not clearer and apologize to Governor Palin, my host where I was speaking, and those who my comments may have offended."<ref>{{cite news| url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/29/black-florida-congressman-apologizes-for-comments-about-palin/ | work=CNN | title=Black Florida congressman apologizes for Palin comments | accessdate=April 23, 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100324180833/http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2008/09/29/black-florida-congressman-apologizes-for-comments-about-palin/| archivedate= 24 March 2010 <!--DASHBot-->| deadurl= no | date=2008-09-29}}</ref>

===Lexus lease===

In May 2009, the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' reported that Hastings spent over $24,000 in taxpayer money in 2008 to lease a luxury [[Lexus Hybrid Drive|Lexus hybrid sedan]]. The ''Journal'' noted that the expenditure was legal, properly accounted for, and drawn from an expense allowance the U.S. government grants to all lawmakers.<ref>{{cite news|first=Louise |last=Radnofsky |author2=Farnam, T.W. |title=Lawmakers Bill Taxpayers For TVs, Cameras, Lexus |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124364352135868189 |work=Wall Street Journal|date=May 30, 2009 |accessdate=2009-06-15 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090608015318/http://online.wsj.com/article/SB124364352135868189.html |archivedate=8 June 2009 |deadurl=no }}

===Comments about Affordable Care Act legislation===

In March 2010, Hastings defended Democrats’ approach to passing the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]], saying "I wish that I had been there when [[Thomas Edison]] made the remark that I think applies here: 'There ain't no rules around here, we're trying to accomplish something.' And therefore, when the deal goes down, all this talk about rules, we make them up as we go along."<ref>{{cite web|url=http://postonpolitics.blog.palmbeachpost.com/2010/03/20/rep-alcee-hastings-invokes-thomas-edison-no-rules-around-here-were-trying-to-accomplish-something/ |title=Rep.
