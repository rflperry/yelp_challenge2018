===Elections===
[[File:Peter DeFazio 105th Congress.jpg|thumb|left|DeFazio in 1997]]
In 1986, DeFazio ran for [[Oregon's 4th congressional district]], vacated by retiring [[incumbent]] Democratic congressman [[Jim Weaver (Oregon politician)|Jim Weaver]].<ref name="cong"/> DeFazio narrowly won in a competitive three-way primary against State Senators [[Bill Bradbury]] and [[Margie Hendriksen]] 34%-33%-31%.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=749083|title=Our Campaigns - OR District 4 - D Primary Race - May 20, 1986|website=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> He won the general election with 54% of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=52177|title=Our Campaigns - OR District 4 Race - Nov 04, 1986|website=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>

He did not face another contest nearly that close until 2010, winning every election before then with at least 61 percent of the vote.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/CandidateDetail.html?CandidateID=1616|title=Our Campaigns - Candidate - Peter A.

Bush]] in 2000 and [[John Kerry]] in 2004, and supported [[Hillary Clinton]] by only 0.1 percentage point in 2016.

;2008
{{See also|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2008#Fourth congressional district}}
DeFazio won 82% of the vote over two minor party candidates.

Earlier, he reportedly considered and re-considered running against [[Gordon H.

After [[Barack Obama]] was elected president in 2008, it was reported that DeFazio was under consideration for nomination as Obama's [[United States Secretary of Transportation|Secretary of Transportation]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Transportation's Obama Factor|url=http://www.trafficworld.com/newssection/government.asp?id=48725}} {{dead link|date=October 2017}}</ref> However, fellow U.S. Representative [[Ray LaHood]], a Republican, was named to the post in December 2008.

;2010
{{Main|United States House of Representatives elections in Oregon, 2010#District4}}
In 2010, DeFazio was challenged by Republican [[Arthur B. Robinson|Art Robinson]] and Pacific Green candidate Michael Beilstein. As a result of the [[SCOTUS]] decision on [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]], a so-called [[Political action committee|Super PAC]] group called The Concerned Taxpayers of America paid $300,000 for ads attacking De Fazio and $150,000 for ads attacking [[Frank Kratovil]] of [[Maryland]]. It was not revealed until the mid-October 2010 quarterly [[Federal Election Commission|FEC]] filings that the group was solely funded by $300,000 from Daniel G. Schuster Inc., a concrete firm in [[Owings Mills, Maryland]], and $200,000 from New York hedge fund executive [[Robert Mercer (businessman)|Robert Mercer]], the co-head of Renaissance Technologies of [[Setauket, New York]]. The FEC filings prior to then listed only a Capitol Hill address and Republican political consultant Jason Miller as treasurer. According to [[Dan Eggen]] at ''[[The Washington Post]]'', the group claims "it was formed in September 'to engage citizens from every walk of life and political affiliation' in the fight against 'runaway spending.'" The only expenditures were for these ads.<ref>{{cite news |author=Karen Tumulty |authorlink=Karen Tumulty |date=September 25, 2010 |title=DeFazio tries to find out who is behind mysterious attack ads |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/09/24/AR2010092406094.html |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]}}</ref><ref>[http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2010/10/wealthy_financier_is_mysteriou.html Wealthy financier is mysterious funder of ads attacking DeFazio], Jeff Mapes, ''[[The Oregonian]]'', October 15, 2010</ref><ref>[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/10/16/AR2010101603822.html Concerned Taxpayers group is powered by only two donors], [[Dan Eggen]], ''[[The Washington Post]]'', October 17, 2010</ref><ref>{{cite news |author=Scott Patterson and Jenny Strasburg |date=March 16, 2010 |title=Pioneering Fund Stages Second Act |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748703494404575082000779302566 |newspaper=[[The Wall Street Journal]]}}</ref>

DeFazio won with 54.5% of the vote, his lowest winning percentage since he was first elected in 1986.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ourcampaigns.com/RaceDetail.html?RaceID=510934|title=Our Campaigns - OR - District 04 Race - Nov 02, 2010|website=Ourcampaigns.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> ''The Oregonian'' stated that the reelection of DeFazio to his 13th term was more notable for the amount of outside money spent on the campaign than the candidates themselves.<ref>

In September 2011, the National Journal cited DeFazio as an example of "swing-district Democrats seeking reelection in 2012," and who, in "begin[ning] to focus on their reelection bids after Labor Day...are increasingly calculating how close is too close to an unpopular President Obama."  It also noted that DeFazio's district "nearly went for Republican George W. Bush in 2004."<ref>{{cite web|title=Democrats Distancing Themselves From Obama|url=http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/democrats-distancing-themselves-from-obama-20110901|publisher=National Journal|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Alex Roarty and Beth Reinhard|date=September 1, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120526221603/http://www.nationaljournal.com/politics/democrats-distancing-themselves-from-obama-20110901|archive-date=26 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref>

Redistricting made the 4th slightly friendlier for DeFazio. He picked up almost all of [[Benton County, Oregon|Benton County]], including all of [[Corvallis, Oregon|Corvallis]], home to [[Oregon State University]].

===Tenure===
[[File:PeterDeFazio.jpg|thumb|left|Peter DeFazio]]DeFazio has a progressive voting record. In 1992, DeFazio was a co-founder of the [[Congressional Progressive Caucus]] along with [[Bernie Sanders]], [[Ron Dellums]], [[Lane Evans]], [[Thomas Andrews]], and [[Maxine Waters]],<ref>{{cite web|title=Caucus Members|author=|url=https://cpc-grijalva.house.gov/index.cfm?sectionid=71&sectiontree=2,71|format=|publisher=Congressional Progressive Caucus|date=|accessdate=30 January 2018}}</ref> and was its chairman from 2003 to 2005.
{{See also|Congressional Progressive Caucus}}
During the 1999 [[World Trade Organization]] meetings in Seattle, DeFazio marched with protesters, many of whom committed acts of violence and looting.<ref>{{cite web |last1=McINTOSH |first1=DON |title=Labor rally opens America's eyes to WTO |url=https://nwlaborpress.org/1999/12-17-99WTO.html |website=Labor Press |accessdate=30 August 2018}}</ref>

====Political positions====
=====Immigration=====
In October 2011, DeFazio demanded that the [[Department of Labor]] strengthen restrictions on the hiring of foreign guest workers for forestry jobs intended for unemployed U.S. citizens. “Over the past year it has come to light that several contractors exploited loopholes in the [[H-2B visa]] process to intentionally hire foreign workers, rather than available Americans, for [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act]]-funded jobs on [[United States Forest Service|Forest Service]] lands in Oregon. This is unacceptable,” DeFazio wrote to the Secretary of Labor. “Taxpayer money was spent to hire foreign workers while unemployed Oregonians were denied these jobs. The Department of Labor owes it to the American taxpayer and the over 13 million unemployed Americans to make sure this can never occur again."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Pope |first1=Charles |title=Rep. Peter DeFazio demands tighter rules, tougher oversight of foreign worker program |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2011/10/post_52.html |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

DeFazio issued a statement condemning President Trump's January 2017 [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] restricting visits to the U.S. from certain Muslim countries. “President Trump's ill-conceived and unlawful executive order uses false rhetoric and preys upon Americans' fears without doing anything to address the real terrorist threats facing our nation,” said DeFazio. “Instead, it sends a dangerous message that Muslims are not welcome in America, alienates our allies, and serves as a recruiting tool for ISIS and other terrorists groups. This irresponsible action puts our nation at risk and stands in opposition to the ideals that our country was founded upon."<ref>{{cite web |title=Ron Wyden, Jeff Merkley, others condemn Donald Trump refugee, immigration orders |url=https://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2017/01/oregon_delegations_statements.html |website=The Oregonian |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

In January 2018, DeFazio's guest for the State of the Union Address was Jesus Narvaez, a so-called “DREAMer,” [[DACA]] activist, and member of Movimiento Estudiantil Chicanx de Aztlán ([[MEChA]]).<ref>{{cite web |last1=Baker |first1=Diana |title=DACA activist brings Dream to DC |url=http://www.lcctorch.com/2018/02/daca-activist-brings-dream-to-dc/ |website=The Torch |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

In June 2018, DeFazio, along with other members of Congress from Oregon, demanded that [[Immigration and Customs Enforcement]] (ICE) permit individuals held at a federal prison in [[Sheridan, Oregon]], under the Trump administration’s “zero-tolerance policy” to make free telephone calls to arrange legal representation.<ref>{{cite web |title=OREGON CONGRESSIONAL DELEGATION PRESSES ICE ON RIGHTS OF IMMIGRANT DETAINEES AT FEDERAL PRISON IN OREGON |url=https://www.merkley.senate.gov/news/press-releases/oregon-congressional-delegation-presses-ice-on-rights-of-immigrant-detainees-at-federal-prison-in-oregon |website=merkley.senate.gov |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

=====Telecom=====
He voted against the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]]—one of only 16 congressmen to do so.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll025.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 025|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> DeFazio particularly objected to a provision that would have deregulated the cable television industry. According to DeFazio, many of his fellow Democratic congressmen later realized "they were idiots" for backing the bill.

=====Trade=====
He was also the only Oregonian who voted against both [[NAFTA]] and [[GATT]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1993/roll575.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 575|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1994/roll507.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL5075|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>

=====Bosnia=====
In 1995, he challenged President [[Bill Clinton|Bill Clinton's]] stance on Bosnia, claiming Clinton and his Cabinet did not make a convincing claim for the operation.

=====Abortion=====
DeFazio is strongly pro-choice, earning a 100 percent rating from [[Planned Parenthood]] in 2010.<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27037 |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031043541/https://www.votesmart.org/issue_rating_category.php?can_id=27037 |archive-date=2010-10-31 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref><ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2010-congressional-record.pdf |title=Archived copy |access-date=2011-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706021016/http://www.prochoiceamerica.org/assets/download-files/2010-congressional-record.pdf |archive-date=2011-07-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}</ref>

=====Military=====
DeFazio has shown a propensity to vote against legislation that would increase the military power of the United States. In 2000, he voted no on legislation to create a [[national missile defense]] network, describing the system as a "comic book fantasy."<ref>{{cite web|title=US Unfazed By Putin Comments On ABM|url=http://www.spacedaily.com/news/bmdo-00zzo.html|publisher=Space Daily|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=July 18, 2000}}</ref> He has consistently voted against the [[Patriot Act]], including its inception after 9/11 and the recurring reauthorization bills, arguing that it infringes on the civil rights of Americans.<ref>{{cite web|title=On Patriot Act, Congress lifts its own gag order|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/news/oregonian/david_sarasohn/index.ssf/2011/02/on_patriot_act_congress_lifts.html|publisher=The Oregonion|accessdate=18 May 2012|author=David Sarasohn|date=February 10, 2011}}</ref> He also voted against the [[USA Freedom Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=
http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2015/roll224.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 224|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> which reauthorized certain provisions of the Patriot Act in modified form. He voted multiple times to set an itinerary for exiting Iraq and bringing the troops home.<ref>{{cite web|title=Oregon Lawmakers Sound Off on President's New Plan For Iraq|url=http://www.salem-news.com/articles/january112007/senators_011107.php|publisher=Salem News|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=Jan 11, 2007}}</ref>

=====Israel and Palestine=====
DeFazio voted against the 2006 Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act, which banned U.S. aid to the [[Hamas]]-led Palestinian government “until it renounces violence, recognizes Israel's right to exist as a Jewish state, and accepts all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.” The bill won the support of 361 House members and was passed by unanimous consent in the Senate.<ref>{{cite web |title=PRO-ISRAEL GROUP SUPPORTS DEFAZIO'S VOTE AGAINST PALESTINIAN SANCTIONS BILL |url=https://defazio.house.gov/media-center/press-releases/pro-israel-group-supports-defazios-vote-against-palestinian-sanctions |website=defazio.house.gov |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |title=H.R.4681 - Palestinian Anti-Terrorism Act of 2006 |url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/109th-congress/house-bill/4681/text |website=congress.gov |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

In 2015, DeFazio was one of 19 members of Congress to sign a letter urging Secretary of State [[John Kerry]] to “prioritize the human rights of Palestinian children living in the [[Occupied West Bank]] in the bilateral relationship with the Government of Israel.” The letter called Israel's treatment of Palestinian children “cruel, inhuman and degrading” and an “anomaly in the world."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Abunimah |first1=Ali |title=US Congress members demand end to Israel’s “cruel” abuses of Palestinian children |url=https://electronicintifada.net/blogs/ali-abunimah/us-congress-members-demand-end-israels-cruel-abuses-palestinian-children |website=The Electronic Intifada |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Bery |first1=Sunjeev |title=Did your Member of Congress Stand Up for Palestinian Children? |url=https://blog.amnestyusa.org/middle-east/did-your-member-of-congress-stand-up-for-palestinian-children/ |website=Amnesty International |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref> In 2017, he was one of 10 members of Congress who introduced a bill that would “require the Secretary of State to certify that United States funds do not support military detention, interrogation, abuse, or ill-treatment of Palestinian children.” DeFazio and his fellow sponsors stated that “the Israeli military detains around 500 to 700 Palestinian children between the ages of 12 and 17 each year, and prosecutes them before a military court system that lacks basic and fundamental guarantees of due process, in violation of international standards."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Tibon |first1=Amir |title=Democrats Push Bill to Block U.S. Aid to Israel From Being Used to Detain Palestinian Minors |url=https://www.haaretz.com/us-news/.premium-democrats-bill-block-aid-to-israel-from-helping-detain-palestinian-kids-1.5465547 |website=Haaretz |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

=====Financial=====
In 2008, DeFazio and California Representative [[Pete Stark]] signed a letter to House Speaker [[Nancy Pelosi]] proposing a one quarter of one percent transaction tax on all trades in financial instruments, including stocks, options, and futures. Subsequently, DeFazio introduced the "No BAILOUT Act."<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-progressives-propose-bailout-alternative|title = The "No BAILOUTS Act"|date = 30 September 2008|accessdate = 20 June 2008|website = The Nation|publisher = |last = Nichols|first = John}}</ref><ref>{{Cite web|url = http://www.thenation.com/blog/house-progressives-propose-bailout-alternative|title = House Progressives Propose Bailout Alternative|date = 30 Sep 2008|accessdate = 20 June 2014|website = The Nation|publisher = |last = Hayes|first = Christopher}}</ref>

Somewhat controversially, DeFazio declined to support the [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009]], voting against the final stimulus package on February 13, 2009. He was one of only seven Democratic House members to vote "nay" on the bill.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2009/roll070.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 070|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://time.com/|title=Page not found - TIME|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> DeFazio said that his vote was due to his frustration over compromises made to win support from moderate Republicans in the [[United States Senate|Senate]]. "I couldn't justify borrowing money for tax cuts," he said, referring to a bipartisan group's decision to cut funding for education and infrastructure initiatives he had supported in favor of steeper tax reductions.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com/2009/02/the-progressive-gadfly-defazio-explains-his-no-on-stimulus.php|title=The Progressive Gadfly: DeFazio Explains His 'No' on Stimulus|website=Tpmdc.talkingpointsmemo.com|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> He also advocated that the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]] change its [[cloture]] rules, doing away with the filibuster.<ref>{{cite news

DeFazio, speaking to press after the exchange, said that he was honored that Obama recognized him and the issues that mattered to his constituents.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://blog.oregonlive.com/mapesonpolitics/2009/03/defazio_gets_obama_jibe_on_sti.html|title=DeFazio gets Obama jibe on stimulus vote|agency=''The Oregonian''|first=Jeff|last=Mapes|date=March 31, 2009}}</ref>

DeFazio made headlines in mid-November 2009 when he suggested in an interview with [[MSNBC]] commentator [[Ed Schultz]] that President Obama should fire [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]] and [[United States National Economic Council|National Economic Council Director]] [[Lawrence Summers]]. "We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get back millions for Americans," said DeFazio.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2009/11/18/rep-defazio-fire-timmy-ge_n_363093.html|agency=''The Huffington Post'' and MSNBC|title=Rep.

A year later he called for the impeachment of Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] because of the Supreme Court ruling on [[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]].

In 2009, DeFazio proposed a [[financial transaction tax]] for within the [[United States]] only (not internationally).<ref name="calls for">{{cite web |url= http://www.oregonlive.com/politics/index.ssf/2009/12/defazio_calls_for_tax_on_high.html|title=DeFazio calls for tax on financial transactions but critics abound |author=Charles Pope |date=December 2009 |work= |publisher= [[The Oregonian]], OregonLive.com|accessdate=2010-01-04}}</ref> (See [[DeFazio financial transaction tax]].)

During his tenure, DeFazio has butted heads with fellow Democratic politicians, including President [[Barack Obama]], on key Democratic legislation. In December 2010, DeFazio told CNN that the White House was "putting on tremendous pressure" about legislation extending the [[Bush tax cuts]], with Obama "making phone calls saying this is the end of his presidency if he doesn't get this bad deal." A White House spokesman ([[Tommy Vietor]]), however, told ''[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]'' that Obama hadn't "said anything remotely like that" and had "never spoken with Mr. DeFazio about the issue."<ref>{{cite news |author=Jordan Fabian |date=December 15, 2010 |title=Obama tells lawmakers not passing tax deal could end presidency, Dem says |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/133909-obama-tells-lawmakers-not-passing-tax-deal-could-end-presidency-dem-says |newspaper=The Hill |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=21 May 2012}}</ref>

In November 2010, DeFazio called on President Obama to fire economic adviser [[Larry Summers]] and Treasury Secretary [[Timothy Geithner]] on the grounds that they were too favorable toward Wall Street. “We think it is time, maybe, that we turn our focus to Main Street — we reclaim some of the unspent [TARP] funds, we reclaim some of the funds that are being paid back, which will not be paid back in full, and we use it to put people back to work. Rebuilding America’s infrastructure is a tried and true way to put people back to work,” said DeFazio. “Unfortunately, the President has an adviser from Wall Street, Larry Summers, and a Treasury Secretary from Wall Street, Timmy Geithner, who don’t like that idea.” In sum, “We may have to sacrifice just two more jobs to get millions back for Americans."<ref>{{cite web |last1=Stein |first1=Sam |title=Rep.

=====Occupy Wall Street=====
In August 2011, DeFazio stated that the President lacked the fight to follow through on the restoration of the Bush tax cuts, citing the pressure placed on him by the Republicans as the reason.<ref>{{cite web|title=DeFazio says Obama lacks will to fight, may lose Oregon|url=http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Democratic-Oregon-Congressman-Rips-into-President-128046958.html|publisher=Channel 8 News, Portland Oregon|accessdate=30 May 2012|author=Pat Dooris|date=August 19, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528215334/http://www.kgw.com/news/local/Democratic-Oregon-Congressman-Rips-into-President-128046958.html|archive-date=28 May 2012|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}</ref> DeFazio, along with fellow congressman Dennis Kucinich and Senator Bernie Sanders, stated that it would be good for the Democratic Party if the President faced a meaningful primary in which all the issues would be aired out.<ref>{{cite web|title=New Hampshire Results Point to a Notable Democratic Enthusiasm Gap|url=http://www.thenation.com/blog/165602/new-hampshire-results-point-notable-democratic-enthusiasm-gap|publisher=TheNation.com|accessdate=15 June 2012|author=John Nichols|date=January 12, 2012}}</ref>

In October 2011, [[Think Progress]] noted that DeFazio, "Echoing the demands of the Occupy Wall Street protesters,...is proposing to tax the trading of stocks, bonds, and derivatives. DeFazio, along with his Senate co-sponsor Sen. Tom Harkin (D-IA), has proposed the tax several times in the past. But this time around, the idea is getting a boost of momentum from the popularity of a similar measure in Europe, as well as renewed national media focus on Wall Street profiteering as a result of the 99 Percent Movement."<ref>{{cite web|title=Calling Wall Street A 'Gambling Casino,' Democratic Rep. DeFazio Proposes Financial Transactions Tax|url=http://thinkprogress.org/economy/2011/10/05/336517/defazio-financial-transactions-tax/|publisher=Think Progress|accessdate=26 June 2012|author=Marie Diamond|date=Oct 5, 2011}}</ref>

Also in October 2011, the [[Daily Caller]] used DeFazio as an example of the increase in "institutional support" being enjoyed by the Occupy movement. Speaking on the House floor, DeFazio said, "Something is happening. Something in this land is happening. I call it the 'American Awakening.'"  He added that "I think the young people and the others who are joining them on Wall Street get it. They may not be totally focused, but they know that this is not a country that gives them a fair shot at the American dream anymore — it is a stacked deck."<ref>{{cite web |url=http://dailycaller.com/2011/10/06/congressional-dems-rally-in-support-of-occupy-wallstreet/ |title=Congressional Dems rally in support of 'Occupy Wall Street' |author=Caroline May |date=October 6, 2011 |website=[[The Daily Caller]] |accessdate=26 June 2012 }}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref>

=====Fuel prices=====
DeFazio opposed the [[Lowering Gasoline Prices to Fuel an America That Works Act of 2014 (H.R. 4899; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would revise existing laws and policies regarding the development of [[petroleum|oil]] and [[natural gas|gas]] resources on the [[Outer Continental Shelf]].<ref name=cbo4899>{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 4899|url=http://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/cbofiles/attachments/hr4899.pdf|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=26 June 2014}}</ref> The bill was intended to increase domestic energy production and lower gas prices.<ref name="HousePassesMarcos"/><ref name="GraeberUPI"/> DeFazio argued that the bill would not solve the true cause of high gas prices which he blamed on "Big Oil in the United States and speculation on Wall Street."<ref name=HousePassesMarcos>{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes bill to increase offshore energy projects|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/210690-house-passes-bill-to-increase-offshore-energy-projects|accessdate=26 June 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=26 June 2014}}</ref> DeFazio called the bill the "drill everywhere" bill.<ref name=GraeberUPI>{{cite news|last1=Graeber|first1=Daniel J.|title=House measure on gas aimed at lower prices|url=http://www.upi.com/Business_News/Energy-Resources/2014/06/27/House-measure-on-gas-aimed-at-lower-prices/9031403872288/|accessdate=27 June 2014|publisher=UPI|date=27 June 2014}}</ref>

=====Gay rights=====
DeFazio supports gay rights. He voted against the [[Defense of Marriage Act]],<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/1996/roll316.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 316|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref> and he voted for the [[Don't Ask, Don't Tell Repeal Act of 2010]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2010/roll638.xml|title=FINAL VOTE RESULTS FOR ROLL CALL 638|website=Clerk.house.gov|accessdate=17 April 2018}}</ref>

=====Airline safety=====
In a 2016 article for ''The Hill'', DeFazio stated that, since 1958, the [[Federal Aviation Authority|FAA]] “has been the model for aviation systems around the world, and it has set the gold standard for aviation safety.” This state of affairs, he argued, was being threatened by the [[Aviation Innovation, Reform, and Reauthorization (AIRR) Act]], which “would shift air traffic operations to a private corporation and leave the FAA’s critical safety functions subject to congressional appropriations.” DeFazio warned that a privatized system, such as the ones already in existence in Canada and the United Kingdom, would not work in the U.S., which has “by far the busiest and most complex airspace in the world,” and would “jeopardize aviation safety” by putting air traffic control in the hands of “private interests with eyes trained on balance sheets."<ref>{{cite web |last1=DeFazio |first1=Peter |title=The devolution of aviation safety |url=http://thehill.com/special-reports/269046-the-devolution-of-aviation-safety |website=The Hill |accessdate=31 August 2018}}</ref>

==U.S. Senate elections==
[[File:Peter DeFazio, official Congressional photo portrait.jpg|thumb|left|Early official portrait of Peter DeFazio.]]

===1995===
After Senator [[Bob Packwood]] resigned in early September 1995, DeFazio ran unsuccessfully for the Democratic nomination for the [[United States Senate]] in a [[By-election|special primary]], losing to 3rd District Congressman [[Ron Wyden]].<ref>{{Cite web|url = http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?fips=41&year=1995&f=0&off=3&elect=7|title = 1995 Senatorial Special Election Results - Oregon|date = 5 Jan 2007|accessdate = June 21, 2014|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}</ref>

===1996===
DeFazio had been mentioned as a possible candidate for the seat of Senator [[Mark Hatfield]], who announced after the special primary election that he would not seek re-election in 1996. However, faced with the prospect of having to take on well-funded millionaires in both the primary and general election, DeFazio announced in February 1996 that he would not run.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

== Personal life ==
DeFazio is a member of the [[Catholicism and American politics|Roman Catholic Church]]. He and his wife, Myrnie L. Daut,<ref name="votesmart"/> reside in [[Springfield, Oregon|Springfield]].
