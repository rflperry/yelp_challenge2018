=== Tenure ===
In December 2011, Rogers voted in support of H.R. 10, the "Regulations From the Executive in Need of Scrutiny Act," which would have required Congressional approval for any "major regulations" issued by the executive branch but, unlike the 1996 Congressional Review Act, would not require the president's signature or override of a probable presidential veto.He earned the title of "April 2012 Porker of the Month" and only a 23% rating from Citizens Against Government Waste


=== Committees ===

Subcommittee on Readiness
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces

== Political positions ==
In 2008, he received a rating of 50% from the American Conservative Union, one of the most moderate voting records of a Southern Republican for that year. Rogers supported an amendment to declare that people retain the right to pray and to recognize their religious beliefs, heritage, and traditions on public property, including schools. He cosponsored legislation to prohibit the physical desecration of the flag of the United States. Rogers sponsored a bill expressing the continued support of Congress for equal access of military recruiters to institutions of higher education. He also introduced legislation making it illegal to satirize or in any way parody the Transportation Security Administration.


=== Environment ===
On February 2, 2017, Rogers sponsored legislation to abolish the Environmental Protection Agency.


=== Economic issues ===
Rogers is a signer of Americans for Tax Reform’s Taxpayer Protection Pledge. He voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.


=== Foreign affairs ===
In June 2016, he called for the United States withdrawal from the United Nations in the wake of the Brexit vote by the United Kingdom to withdraw from the European Union. On January 3, 2017, Rogers once again called for the US to withdrawal from the United Nations by introducing the "American Sovereignty Act of 2017" to the House of Representatives. The bill is currently in the introductory state and still needs House, Senate, and presidential approval.


== Political campaigns ==
In a very close election, the Turnham-Rogers contest was one of the most closely watched in 2002. Both Democratic and Republican National parties targeted the district, with Speaker Dennis Hastert promising Rogers a seat on the Armed Services committee should he win.  Rogers heavily outspent Turnham, raising and spending $1,656,290 to Turnham's $1,015,132, with Rogers enjoying an even greater margin in independent expenditures.  Rogers narrowly won the election by a 50%–48% margin.  In this election, Rogers became a rare Republican endorsee of The Anniston Star.However, Rogers has only faced one other contest nearly that close. In 2008, Joshua Segall held him to only 54 percent of the vote—the only time since his initial election that Rogers has fallen below 59 percent of the vote.
2008 Rogers won against Democratic nominee Joshua Segall, a Montgomery attorney, and Independent Mark Layfield.
2010 Rogers defeated Democratic nominee Steve Segrest.


=== Campaign contributions from ARMPAC ===
Rogers was a recipient of former House Majority Leader Tom DeLay's ARMPAC campaign contributions. DeLay was prosecuted and convicted on charges of felony money laundering of campaign finances and conspiracy to launder money. As of August 2016, Rogers has not offered to return any of the $30,000 he received. Rogers said that DeLay is innocent until proven guilty, and that he would not return the money "while the judicial process runs its course."
