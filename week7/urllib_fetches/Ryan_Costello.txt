A Republican, Costello is the representative for Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district, elected in 2014 to the United States House of Representatives. He previously served on the Chester County Board of Commissioners (2011–2015), and as its chair from 2013 to 2015. He announced his retirement in 2018 on MSNBC, stating that he would not seek reelection. After announcing his retirement, CNN called him a "rare brand in the House GOP conference: a young moderate willing to break with his leadership and his President on everything from gun control bills to repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act."


== Early life ==
Costello was born in 1976 to schoolteacher parents. Costello attended Ursinus College and Villanova University School of Law.


== Political career ==

=== U.S. House elections ===


==== 2014 ====
When Jim Gerlach, the Republican incumbent in Pennsylvania's 6th congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, announced that he would not run for reelection in 2014, Costello chose to run for the Republican Party nomination. He faced no primary opposition. He faced Manan Trivedi of the Democratic Party in the general election. Costello defeated Trivedi, 56%–44%.


==== 2016 ====
In 2016, Democrat Mike Parrish challenged Costello. Hacked material from Parrish was leaked during the campaign, but the Costello campaign took the position that they would not use the illicitly obtained materials during the election. Vincent Galko, a consultant for Costello, said, "When news broke that this material had likely been stolen by a foreign actor, we immediately said, ‘We’re not going to use it.'"Costello was re-elected by a wide margin of 57.2 to 42.8.


=== Tenure ===
For his first two terms, Costello represented a district that took in northern Chester County and western Montgomery County, then reached across Berks County to take in much of heavily Republican Lebanon County. However, in February 2018, the Pennsylvania Supreme Court, which has a Democratic majority, released a new map for the state's congressional districts to replace a map which the court had previously struck down as a Republican partisan gerrymander. The court imposed a new map after the state legislature refused to submit a replacement. Costello was the only incumbent who retained his old district number. However, the 6th was made significantly more compact. It lost most of its heavily Republican western portion, as well as its share of Montgomery County. Instead, it now took in all of Chester County as well as most of the more Democratic portions of Berks County, including Reading.According to The Philadelphia Inquirer, "Of the many Republicans who took a political blow from Pennsylvania's new congressional map, Chester County's Ryan Costello got hit the hardest." Costello saw his district move from having a Republican-leaning constituency to a district Hillary Clinton won by nine points. The Philadelphia Inquirer wrote that "the previous, GOP-drawn map was one factor aiding Republicans as they held a firm grip on every competitive seat in the moderate Philadelphia suburbs." According to the Pottstown Mercury, the Republican-drawn congressional map was "widely viewed as among the nation’s most gerrymandered." After the new congressional map was released, Costello said he supported impeaching the justices who imposed the map, calling the court corrupt and undemocratic. Republicans requested that the United States Supreme Court intervene in the redistricting dispute, although Politico reported that the Republican challenge was unlikely to be successful. In March 2018, a panel of federal judges refused to block the new congressional map from going into effect.In March 2018, Costello filed petitions to get on the 2018 ballot, but later that month, he announced that he was dropping his reelection bid. According to The Hill, he became frustrated with the Trump administration, which contributed to his dropping from the race.


=== Political positions ===
Throughout his tenure, Costello has been ranked as one of the most bipartisan Members of Congress, breaking with his party to support environment, health care, and education initiatives.  In 2017, Costello ranked ninth out of 435 Members of Congress in bipartisanship.In May 2017, Costello broke from his party and voted against the Republican health care legislation, the Affordable Health Care Act (AHCA). In November 2017, Costello voted for the Republican Party's 2017 tax plan that passed the House. He also voted in favor of a 2018 bipartisan bill to fund the federal government.In May 2018, Costello signed the discharge petition that would call for the House to vote on immigration legislation.  He has supported efforts to allow for DACA children to remain in the United States.
