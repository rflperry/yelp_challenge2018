Clark was the Democratic nominee in the 2013 special election for the U.S. House of Representatives in Massachusetts's 5th congressional district.  The district's longtime incumbent, Ed Markey, had just been elected to the United States Senate six months into his 19th term.  In a heavily-contested Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—she was endorsed by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and also received the endorsement of EMILY's List. On October 15, 2013 she won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote. Her closest competitor was Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian, who won 22% of the vote.   On December 10, 2013, as expected, she easily won the special election.Clark was sworn into office December 12, 2013 and sits on the House Appropriations Committee. In a 2014 interview with The Boston Globe, she compared the television series House of Cards to life in Washington, saying "It's exactly like here; minus the murders."Clark was unopposed in her bid for a full term in 2014.
In early March 2015, Clark decided not to attend the speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before a joint session of Congress. Clark said she remains committed to maintaining and strengthening what she called the special relationship between the U.S. and Israel, but noted the invitation was offered without first consulting the Obama administration, as is customary.Clark has introduced legislation in response to Internet harassment, most notably resulting from the Gamergate controversy, and she has advocated for more stringent enforcement of existing laws. After introducing legislation that would criminalize "swatting" (falsely reporting an ongoing critical incident to dispatch an emergency response), she was herself targeted by a false report of an active shooter at her home.In January 2017, Clark announced a ceremonial boycott of the inauguration of Donald Trump. She was one of a small group of House and Senate members who chose to boycott Trump's swearing-in ceremony. Her reasons, according to the Boston Globe, for not attending were due to her desire not to "normalize" Trump's promotion of "bigoted, misogynist, anti-Semitic, and racist claims."In May 2017, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos addressed the House Appropriations subcommittee.  Clark asked DeVos: If a state private school voucher program wanted to discriminate against LGBTQ students using federal taxpayer dollars, would the Education Department step in to stand up for students and taxpayers?She is a member of the Congressional Progressive Caucus and the Congressional Asian Pacific American Caucus.

The district's longtime incumbent, Ed Markey, had just been elected to the United States Senate six months into his 19th term.  In a heavily-contested Democratic primary—the real contest in this heavily Democratic district—she was endorsed by Massachusetts Attorney General Martha Coakley and also received the endorsement of EMILY's List. On October 15, 2013 she won the Democratic primary with a plurality of 32% of the vote. Her closest competitor was Middlesex County Sheriff Peter Koutoujian, who won 22% of the vote.

In early March 2015, Clark decided not to attend the speech by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu before a joint session of Congress.

She was one of a small group of House and Senate members who chose to boycott Trump's swearing-in ceremony.
