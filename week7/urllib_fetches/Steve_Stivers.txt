The bill was referred to committee and was rejected, but Stivers has resubmitted it twice more, once in April 2013 (again rejected in committee) and again in January 2015 (once more referred to committee).  In spite of the US Mint releasing a technical report in December 2014 for its Alternative Metals Study in which it reported that steel is an unacceptable material for US coins (due to difficulty in minting, lack of security, and severe impact on both the public and the coin vending industry), Stivers kept the wording of his bill identical to the previous two versions.

I urge the Administration to quickly replace this temporary order with permanent improvements in the visa vetting process."
Social securityStivers opposes the privatization of social security.  In addition, he also opposes raising the retirement age from its current state.

=== National Republican Congressional Committee ===
Stivers beat Rep. Roger Williams to be elected chair the National Republican Congressional Committee on November 18, 2016. In his position to support Republican congressional candidates, Stivers said his goal is to "defy history" in protecting his party's majority in the House. In June 2018, Stivers did not denounce the use of hacked materials in election campaigns, saying that as chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee he wouldn't "run down one of my candidates for using something that's in the public domain."


==== Candidate conduct ====
In response to congressional candidate Greg Gianforte being charged with assault on the eve of Montana's special election, Stivers characterized the assault as "out of character."

=== Elections ===
2008

In November 2007, Stivers announced he would run for election to Congress in Ohio's 15th District, a seat held by retiring Republican member Deborah Pryce. He won the Republican nomination and ran against Democratic Franklin County Commissioner Mary Jo Kilroy, who had nearly unseated Pryce in 2006, Libertarian Mark Noble and Independent Don Elijah Eckhart. Stivers lost by 2,311 votes, conceding on December 7, 2008, after a long vote  recount.

2010

Stivers won the Republican primary with 82% of the vote. He again faced Democratic incumbent Mary Jo Kilroy along with Constitution Party nominee David Ryon and Libertarian nominee William J. Kammerer. On November 2, 2010, Kilroy conceded to Stivers, who won by a 54% to 42% margin.

2012
Redistricting after the 2010 census made the 15th much friendlier to Stivers. During his first term, he represented a fairly compact district covering all of Union and Madison counties, as well as most of downtown and western Columubus. The new map, however, pushed the 15th into more rural and exurban territory south and west of the capital.
Stivers ran again in 2012 against Democratic nominee Pat Lang.  He was endorsed by the NRA, National Right to Life, Ohio State Medical Association and United States Chamber of Commerce. Stivers was re-elected by 76,397 votes.

He was part of a proposal to add a balanced budget amendment to the US Constitution.  Stivers voted to offset the costs of disaster relief spending through discretionary budget cuts.On December 15, 2011, Stivers introduced a bill that would alter the composition of the penny, nickel, dime and quarter to steel, with a copper coat for the penny, which claimed to save an estimated $433,000,000 over the course of ten years.  The bill was referred to committee and was rejected, but Stivers has resubmitted it twice more, once in April 2013 (again rejected in committee) and again in January 2015 (once more referred to committee).  In spite of the US Mint releasing a technical report in December 2014 for its Alternative Metals Study in which it reported that steel is an unacceptable material for US coins (due to difficulty in minting, lack of security, and severe impact on both the public and the coin vending industry), Stivers kept the wording of his bill identical to the previous two versions.
He voted to audit the Federal Reserve and its recent actions, specifically its involvement in mortgage loans.
EnergyStivers supports all energy options, including green, nuclear, and clean coal and supports tax benefits for renewable energy usage.  However Stivers opposes federal regulations on efficiency standards

National securityStivers opposed President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that "While I agree with the President that we must improve our visa vetting process in order to better protect Americans, I believe the executive order risks violating our nation's values and fails to differentiate mainstream Islamic partners from radical Islamic terrorists — setting back our fight against radical Islam. I urge the Administration to quickly replace this temporary order with permanent improvements in the visa vetting process."
Social securityStivers opposes the privatization of social security.  In addition, he also opposes raising the retirement age from its current state.
TaxesStivers took the Taxpayer Protection pledge, insuring he would not support any tax raises.  He supports a flat federal tax rate across the board for all income brackets.


=== Legislation ===
Stivers was ranked as the 36th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress (and the second most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio) by The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy.
