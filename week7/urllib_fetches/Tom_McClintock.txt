=== 2002 Controller election ===

McClintock ran for State Controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee Steve Westly, an eBay executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock's campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character Angus McClintock, a fictional cousin and fellow Scottish American extolling Tom McClintock's virtues of thriftiness and accountability with low-budget fifteen-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes behind Westley, who won with a plurality of 45.3% of the vote.

2008
On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 4th congressional district, which is hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican John Doolittle, decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the California Constitution required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term. Furthermore, in order to vote using a ballot in regards to a specific congressional district, one must live within that district. Because Thousand Oaks is outside of California's Fourth Congressional District, McClintock was thus ineligible to vote for himself.Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock. McClintock was endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, Club for Growth, and U.S. Congressman Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman Doug Ose, a moderate represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54–39%.The Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charlie Brown, who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the California State Senate, despite the fact that he lived in Elk Grove, near Sacramento, for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his State Senate district. He stated, "Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here." However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but uses his mother's address. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband. McClintock ran ads attacking Brown's participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, an infamous anti-war group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.By November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the largest county in the district. Brown won just three of the district's nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). Ultimately, McClintock won mainly on the strength of coattails from John McCain, who carried the 4th with 54 percent of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.

2010
McClintock was challenged in the Republican primary again, this time by Michael Babich. He easily defeated Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he easily won re-election to a second term, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31%, winning all of the counties in the district.
2012
Redistricting pushed the 4th well to the south. It now stretched from the Sacramento suburbs to the outer suburbs of Fresno. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. However, it is as strongly Republican as its predecessor.
He easily won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Jack Uppal 61–39%. He won all but two of the district's ten counties: Nevada (37%) and Alpine (41%).
2014
McClintock won re-election, finishing first in California's "top two" primary, and defeating moderate Republican challenger, National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60–40%.
2016
McClintock again finished first in the primary and subsequently defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired UC Davis professor, in the general election, 63–37%.


=== Tenure ===
During the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 "staunch" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. McClintock's Chief of Staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California's 7th congressional district in 2014.
In 2009, McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.McClintock voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against the first version of the bill, displeased with the removal of deductions related to medical expenses, student loan interest and casualty loss. Those three items were addressed in the final version of the bill which McClintock voted 'yay'. McClintock claims the bill will "restore American workers to an internationally competitive position." He has expressed concern regarding the bill's impact on the budget deficit and anticipates that it will be addressed "by spending reforms this coming year."In 2017 McClintock voted against the repeal of Obamacare budget.In 2017 Tom McClintock called for special prosecutor Mueller against President Trump. McClintock felt that the firing of Comey justified the special prosecutor.


=== Legislation ===
McClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service's decision to pursue a "new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands." McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation "illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend."For his five terms in office, McClintock was the primary sponsor of three bills that were enacted into law.  On June 14, 2013, McClintock introduced the bill To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to take certain Federal lands located in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians (H.R. 2388; 113th Congress), a bill that would take specified federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians.  The other two bills were to rename Post Offices.  (H.R. 3892 and H.R. 3319).

=== Climate Change ===
McClintock does not believe climate change is caused by humans.  He has said: "You see, it was me – and not Al Gore – who discovered the theory of Global Climate Change, and yet all you ever hear is Al Gore said this and Al Gore said that. My climate change discovery came in the fall of 1964, when Miss Conroy took our third grade class to the Museum of Natural History. It was there that we saw the panorama of dinosaurs tromping around the steamy swamps that are now part of Wyoming.  That panorama was right next to the exhibit of the Wooly Mammoths foraging on glaciers that were also once the same part of Wyoming.  And I thought to myself, 'Gee, those dinosaurs are nifty.”  And then I thought to myself, “Good God, the climate must have changed from time to time.'"

In the general election, he faced Kathleen Connell, former Special Assistant to Los Angeles Mayor Tom Bradley and Director of L.A. Housing Authority.

=== 2002 Controller election ===

McClintock ran for State Controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee Steve Westly, an eBay executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock's campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character Angus McClintock, a fictional cousin and fellow Scottish American extolling Tom McClintock's virtues of thriftiness and accountability with low-budget fifteen-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes behind Westley, who won with a plurality of 45.3% of the vote. McClintock obtained 45.1% of the vote, while three other candidates obtained a combined 9.5% of the vote.

In 2003, he ran for the recall election against incumbent Democrat Gray Davis. Republican and film actor Arnold Schwarzenegger won the election with 49% of the vote. Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante finished second with 31% of the vote, which was about 17 points behind Schwarzenegger. McClintock finished in third place with 14% of the vote, which was about 35 points behind Schwarzenegger. Together, Republicans Schwarzenegger and McClintock were supported by 5,363,778 Californians, or 62.1% of the vote. 132 other candidates obtained the remaining 6.4% of the vote.McClintock performed the best in Stanislaus County, where he obtained 24% of the vote.

== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== Elections ===
1992After redistricting, State Assemblyman McClintock decided to retire in order to challenge Democratic U.S. Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson in California's 24th congressional district. He won the nine-candidate Republican primary with a plurality of 34% of the vote, beating second-place finisher Sang Korman by eleven percentage points. Beilenson defeated McClintock 56–39%.
2008
On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 4th congressional district, which is hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican John Doolittle, decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the California Constitution required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term. Furthermore, in order to vote using a ballot in regards to a specific congressional district, one must live within that district. Because Thousand Oaks is outside of California's Fourth Congressional District, McClintock was thus ineligible to vote for himself.Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock. McClintock was endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, Club for Growth, and U.S. Congressman Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman Doug Ose, a moderate represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54–39%.The Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charlie Brown, who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the California State Senate, despite the fact that he lived in Elk Grove, near Sacramento, for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his State Senate district. He stated, "Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here." However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but uses his mother's address. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband. McClintock ran ads attacking Brown's participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, an infamous anti-war group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.By November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the largest county in the district. Brown won just three of the district's nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). Ultimately, McClintock won mainly on the strength of coattails from John McCain, who carried the 4th with 54 percent of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.

2010
McClintock was challenged in the Republican primary again, this time by Michael Babich. He easily defeated Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he easily won re-election to a second term, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31%, winning all of the counties in the district.
2012
Redistricting pushed the 4th well to the south. It now stretched from the Sacramento suburbs to the outer suburbs of Fresno. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. However, it is as strongly Republican as its predecessor.
He easily won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Jack Uppal 61–39%. He won all but two of the district's ten counties: Nevada (37%) and Alpine (41%).
2014
McClintock won re-election, finishing first in California's "top two" primary, and defeating moderate Republican challenger, National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60–40%.
2016
McClintock again finished first in the primary and subsequently defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired UC Davis professor, in the general election, 63–37%.


=== Tenure ===
During the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 "staunch" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. McClintock's Chief of Staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California's 7th congressional district in 2014.
In 2009, McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.McClintock voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against the first version of the bill, displeased with the removal of deductions related to medical expenses, student loan interest and casualty loss. Those three items were addressed in the final version of the bill which McClintock voted 'yay'. McClintock claims the bill will "restore American workers to an internationally competitive position." He has expressed concern regarding the bill's impact on the budget deficit and anticipates that it will be addressed "by spending reforms this coming year."In 2017 McClintock voted against the repeal of Obamacare budget.In 2017 Tom McClintock called for special prosecutor Mueller against President Trump. McClintock felt that the firing of Comey justified the special prosecutor.


=== Legislation ===
McClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service's decision to pursue a "new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands." McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation "illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend."For his five terms in office, McClintock was the primary sponsor of three bills that were enacted into law.  On June 14, 2013, McClintock introduced the bill To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to take certain Federal lands located in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians (H.R. 2388; 113th Congress), a bill that would take specified federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians.  The other two bills were to rename Post Offices.  (H.R. 3892 and H.R. 3319).

The McClintock bill is a rider to the budget appropriations bill. McClintock's marijuana bill was voted down again in March 2018.


=== Climate Change ===
McClintock does not believe climate change is caused by humans.  He has said: "You see, it was me – and not Al Gore – who discovered the theory of Global Climate Change, and yet all you ever hear is Al Gore said this and Al Gore said that. My climate change discovery came in the fall of 1964, when Miss Conroy took our third grade class to the Museum of Natural History. It was there that we saw the panorama of dinosaurs tromping around the steamy swamps that are now part of Wyoming.  That panorama was right next to the exhibit of the Wooly Mammoths foraging on glaciers that were also once the same part of Wyoming.  And I thought to myself, 'Gee, those dinosaurs are nifty.”  And then I thought to myself, “Good God, the climate must have changed from time to time.'"

He has said: "You see, it was me – and not Al Gore – who discovered the theory of Global Climate Change, and yet all you ever hear is Al Gore said this and Al Gore said that. My climate change discovery came in the fall of 1964, when Miss Conroy took our third grade class to the Museum of Natural History. It was there that we saw the panorama of dinosaurs tromping around the steamy swamps that are now part of Wyoming.  That panorama was right next to the exhibit of the Wooly Mammoths foraging on glaciers that were also once the same part of Wyoming.  And I thought to myself, 'Gee, those dinosaurs are nifty.”  And then I thought to myself, “Good God, the climate must have changed from time to time.'"

=== 2002 Controller election ===

McClintock ran for State Controller again in 2002, facing Democratic nominee Steve Westly, an eBay executive. Westly outspent him 5-to-1. McClintock's campaigns focused on increasing accountability for the state budget. The ads featured the character Angus McClintock, a fictional cousin and fellow Scottish American extolling Tom McClintock's virtues of thriftiness and accountability with low-budget fifteen-second ads. He lost by a margin of just 0.2%, or 16,811 votes behind Westley, who won with a plurality of 45.3% of the vote. McClintock obtained 45.1% of the vote, while three other candidates obtained a combined 9.5% of the vote.

Democratic Lieutenant Governor Cruz Bustamante finished second with 31% of the vote, which was about 17 points behind Schwarzenegger.

1992After redistricting, State Assemblyman McClintock decided to retire in order to challenge Democratic U.S. Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson in California's 24th congressional district. He won the nine-candidate Republican primary with a plurality of 34% of the vote, beating second-place finisher Sang Korman by eleven percentage points. Beilenson defeated McClintock 56–39%.
2008
On March 4, 2008, McClintock announced his candidacy for the U.S. House of Representatives in California's 4th congressional district, which is hundreds of miles away from the district McClintock represented in the state Senate. The district's nine-term incumbent, fellow Republican John Doolittle, decided to retire. McClintock was unable to vote for himself in either the primary or the general election because the California Constitution required him to maintain his legal residence in his State Senate district until the end of his Senate term. Furthermore, in order to vote using a ballot in regards to a specific congressional district, one must live within that district. Because Thousand Oaks is outside of California's Fourth Congressional District, McClintock was thus ineligible to vote for himself.Upon McClintock's entry into the race, fellow Republicans Rico Oller and Eric Egland withdrew from the Republican primary and endorsed McClintock. McClintock was endorsed by the Republican Liberty Caucus, Club for Growth, and U.S. Congressman Ron Paul. McClintock faced former U.S. Congressman Doug Ose, a moderate represented the neighboring 3rd District from 1999 to 2005. Ose lived outside the district and was painted as a carpetbagger and a liberal who had voted to raise taxes and who voted for earmarks. McClintock defeated Ose 54–39%.The Democratic nominee was retired Air Force Lt. Col. Charlie Brown, who ran an unexpectedly strong race against Doolittle in 2006. In March 2008, Ose's campaign commercials criticized McClintock for receiving payments totaling over $300,000 in per diem living expenses during his time in the California State Senate, despite the fact that he lived in Elk Grove, near Sacramento, for most of the year. McClintock maintained that the payments were justified because his legal residence was in Thousand Oaks, in his State Senate district. He stated, "Every legislator's [Sacramento area] residence is close to the Capitol. My residential costs up here are much greater than the average legislator because my family is here." However, Ose's campaign commercials argued McClintock does not own or rent a home in the 19th district, but uses his mother's address. These attacks prompted a response from McClintock's wife, Lori, who said McClintock stays with his mother in order to better care for her after she fell ill and after the death of her husband. McClintock ran ads attacking Brown's participation at a 2005 protest by Code Pink, an infamous anti-war group, and argued Brown supported gay marriage but not the troops in Iraq. He also portrayed Brown as a clone of Speaker Nancy Pelosi.By November 23, 2008, McClintock led Brown by 1,566 votes (0.4% of the vote), 184,190 to 182,624. Subsequent returns expanded the margin slightly with the last returns coming in from El Dorado County shortly after Thanksgiving. On December 1, 2008, McClintock declared victory and on December 3, 2008, Brown conceded the race. McClintock defeated Brown by a margin of 0.5%, or 1,800 votes. He prevailed by a 3,500-vote margin in Placer County, the largest county in the district. Brown won just three of the district's nine counties: Sierra (49.8%), Plumas (47.9%), and Nevada (42.3%). Ultimately, McClintock won mainly on the strength of coattails from John McCain, who carried the 4th with 54 percent of the vote, his fifth-best total in the state.

2010
McClintock was challenged in the Republican primary again, this time by Michael Babich. He easily defeated Babich 78–22%. On November 2, he easily won re-election to a second term, defeating businessman Clint Curtis 61–31%, winning all of the counties in the district.
2012
Redistricting pushed the 4th well to the south. It now stretched from the Sacramento suburbs to the outer suburbs of Fresno. Only three counties remained from the old 4th: Nevada, Placer, and El Dorado. However, it is as strongly Republican as its predecessor.
He easily won re-election to a third term, defeating Democrat Jack Uppal 61–39%. He won all but two of the district's ten counties: Nevada (37%) and Alpine (41%).
2014
McClintock won re-election, finishing first in California's "top two" primary, and defeating moderate Republican challenger, National Guard Major Art Moore in the general election, 60–40%.
2016
McClintock again finished first in the primary and subsequently defeated Democrat Robert W. Derlet, a physician, environmentalist and retired UC Davis professor, in the general election, 63–37%.


=== Tenure ===
During the 112th Congress McClintock was one of 40 "staunch" members of the Republican Study Committee who frequently voted against Republican party leadership and vocally expressed displeasure with House bills. In 2011, McClintock voted against the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2012 as part of a controversial provision that allows the government and the military to indefinitely detain American citizens and others without trial. McClintock's Chief of Staff, Igor Birman, was a candidate for Congress in California's 7th congressional district in 2014.
In 2009, McClintock signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.McClintock voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. He voted against the first version of the bill, displeased with the removal of deductions related to medical expenses, student loan interest and casualty loss. Those three items were addressed in the final version of the bill which McClintock voted 'yay'. McClintock claims the bill will "restore American workers to an internationally competitive position." He has expressed concern regarding the bill's impact on the budget deficit and anticipates that it will be addressed "by spending reforms this coming year."In 2017 McClintock voted against the repeal of Obamacare budget.In 2017 Tom McClintock called for special prosecutor Mueller against President Trump. McClintock felt that the firing of Comey justified the special prosecutor.


=== Legislation ===
McClintock supported the Water Rights Protection Act, a bill that would prevent federal agencies from requiring certain entities to relinquish their water rights to the United States in order to use public lands. The bill was a reaction to the United States Forest Service's decision to pursue a "new regulation to demand that water rights be transferred to the federal government as a condition for obtaining permits needed to operate 121 ski resorts that cross over federal lands." McClintock supported the bill, saying that the Forest Service's regulation "illustrates an increasingly hostile attitude by this agency toward those who make productive use of our vast national forests, in this case by enhancing and attracting the tourism upon which our mountain communities depend."For his five terms in office, McClintock was the primary sponsor of three bills that were enacted into law.  On June 14, 2013, McClintock introduced the bill To authorize the Secretary of the Interior to take certain Federal lands located in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the benefit of the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians (H.R. 2388; 113th Congress), a bill that would take specified federal land in El Dorado County, California, into trust for the Shingle Springs Band of Miwok Indians.  The other two bills were to rename Post Offices.  (H.R. 3892 and H.R. 3319).

=== Climate Change ===
McClintock does not believe climate change is caused by humans.  He has said: "You see, it was me – and not Al Gore – who discovered the theory of Global Climate Change, and yet all you ever hear is Al Gore said this and Al Gore said that. My climate change discovery came in the fall of 1964, when Miss Conroy took our third grade class to the Museum of Natural History. It was there that we saw the panorama of dinosaurs tromping around the steamy swamps that are now part of Wyoming.  That panorama was right next to the exhibit of the Wooly Mammoths foraging on glaciers that were also once the same part of Wyoming.  And I thought to myself, 'Gee, those dinosaurs are nifty.”  And then I thought to myself, “Good God, the climate must have changed from time to time.'"
