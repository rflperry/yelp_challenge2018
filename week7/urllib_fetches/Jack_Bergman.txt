=== Baseball field shooting ===
In June 2017, Bergman was one of the Republican congressmen who were practicing on an Alexandria, Virginia, baseball field for the annual congressional baseball game when a man named James Hodgkinson began shooting at them, harming four people, including Cong. Steve Scalise (R-LA).Bergman "was about to take the batter's box when he heard the first shot." Not knowing how many shooters there were, "I just basically went into a low crawl and crawled behind the first base dugout and listened... It appeared as though the shooter was moving around the outside of the perimeter moving towards the backstop, so once that was the situation then I along with a couple of other folks who were behind the dugout crawled around and went down into the dugout in case the shooter came all around behind the backstop."Afterwards, Bergman blamed the incident on anti-GOP rhetoric. "The hateful rhetoric serves no positive purpose, in fact today it obviously served a negative purpose, but unfortunately, and I'm looking at all the media in the eye when I say this: Friendships and cordial relationships don't make good news," Bergman said. "So, I can tell you, especially as president of the freshman class of Republicans, we are united along with our Democratic freshman counterparts to bring civility back to the 115th Congress." Asked if he was blaming the media, Bergman said, "I think the media is complicit if they keep inciting as opposed to informing."


=== Political positions ===
In a July 2016 television interview, Bergman said his three top priorities were to "get Congress working together" instead of being preoccupied with partisan division, to "utilize the Constitution," and to pass a balanced budget amendment.
Government spendingIn March 2016, he said that cutting spending would be his top priority in Congress. "The debt that our country is saddling our grandchildren with is insurmountable," he said. "When you combine that with the safety and security issues that our country is facing, we need to send a different type of person to Washington D.C." 
HealthcareIn May 2017, Bergman co-sponsored the MacArthur Amendment, which would eliminate healthcare exemptions for members of Congress that were permitted under the American Health Care Act (AHCA). "We are all equal in the eyes of the law," Bergman said, "and as Members of Congress, we are obligated to live by the standards we set for the American people. In the context of health care, that means coverage should be available to Representatives and our staffs on the same basis that it's available to our constituents."
EnvironmentIn September 2017, Bergman became the 29th Republican to join the Climate Solutions Caucus, after having had several friendly meetings with members of the Citizens Climate Lobby who attend high school in his district. At a June meeting with them, he had committed to joining the caucus, and also asked the students to prepare "a formal presentation on Carbon Fee and Dividend and pitch it to him back at home like a business proposal" in August. According to the CCL, Bergman "was particularly interested in the potential job growth Carbon Fee and Dividend would likely bring to the health sector." 
MilitaryIn an August 2017 interview, Bergman "critiqued politicians who have not served in uniform for making misguided military policy decisions." He said that in order to have the kind of political leadership that is needed in regard to military policy, "you really have to have those people who were boots on the ground. There are a lot of people who really think they are making good decisions as it relates to the military who have no clue what the ramifications of that decision are because they have never been part of it."
Bergman sided with President Trump that transgender individuals should be barred from the military. "The U.S. military is not a social experiment," he said. He added: "I do not support elective surgery of any kind, zero federal dollars spent on elective surgery. I'm all about readiness and winning the fight. Anything that challenges unit cohesion is counterproductive and people get hurt."
Party identityHe considers himself a conservative but does not feel strongly about party. "As a senior military officer, I could not be part of a political party," he has said. "[S]wearing that oath to the Constitution, and being in uniform, we represent everyone, not just some."

=== Baseball field shooting ===
In June 2017, Bergman was one of the Republican congressmen who were practicing on an Alexandria, Virginia, baseball field for the annual congressional baseball game when a man named James Hodgkinson began shooting at them, harming four people, including Cong. Steve Scalise (R-LA).Bergman "was about to take the batter's box when he heard the first shot." Not knowing how many shooters there were, "I just basically went into a low crawl and crawled behind the first base dugout and listened... It appeared as though the shooter was moving around the outside of the perimeter moving towards the backstop, so once that was the situation then I along with a couple of other folks who were behind the dugout crawled around and went down into the dugout in case the shooter came all around behind the backstop."Afterwards, Bergman blamed the incident on anti-GOP rhetoric. "The hateful rhetoric serves no positive purpose, in fact today it obviously served a negative purpose, but unfortunately, and I'm looking at all the media in the eye when I say this: Friendships and cordial relationships don't make good news," Bergman said. "So, I can tell you, especially as president of the freshman class of Republicans, we are united along with our Democratic freshman counterparts to bring civility back to the 115th Congress." Asked if he was blaming the media, Bergman said, "I think the media is complicit if they keep inciting as opposed to informing."


=== Political positions ===
In a July 2016 television interview, Bergman said his three top priorities were to "get Congress working together" instead of being preoccupied with partisan division, to "utilize the Constitution," and to pass a balanced budget amendment.
Government spendingIn March 2016, he said that cutting spending would be his top priority in Congress. "The debt that our country is saddling our grandchildren with is insurmountable," he said. "When you combine that with the safety and security issues that our country is facing, we need to send a different type of person to Washington D.C." 
HealthcareIn May 2017, Bergman co-sponsored the MacArthur Amendment, which would eliminate healthcare exemptions for members of Congress that were permitted under the American Health Care Act (AHCA). "We are all equal in the eyes of the law," Bergman said, "and as Members of Congress, we are obligated to live by the standards we set for the American people. In the context of health care, that means coverage should be available to Representatives and our staffs on the same basis that it's available to our constituents."
EnvironmentIn September 2017, Bergman became the 29th Republican to join the Climate Solutions Caucus, after having had several friendly meetings with members of the Citizens Climate Lobby who attend high school in his district. At a June meeting with them, he had committed to joining the caucus, and also asked the students to prepare "a formal presentation on Carbon Fee and Dividend and pitch it to him back at home like a business proposal" in August. According to the CCL, Bergman "was particularly interested in the potential job growth Carbon Fee and Dividend would likely bring to the health sector." 
MilitaryIn an August 2017 interview, Bergman "critiqued politicians who have not served in uniform for making misguided military policy decisions." He said that in order to have the kind of political leadership that is needed in regard to military policy, "you really have to have those people who were boots on the ground. There are a lot of people who really think they are making good decisions as it relates to the military who have no clue what the ramifications of that decision are because they have never been part of it."
Bergman sided with President Trump that transgender individuals should be barred from the military. "The U.S. military is not a social experiment," he said. He added: "I do not support elective surgery of any kind, zero federal dollars spent on elective surgery. I'm all about readiness and winning the fight. Anything that challenges unit cohesion is counterproductive and people get hurt."
Party identityHe considers himself a conservative but does not feel strongly about party. "As a senior military officer, I could not be part of a political party," he has said. "[S]wearing that oath to the Constitution, and being in uniform, we represent everyone, not just some."
