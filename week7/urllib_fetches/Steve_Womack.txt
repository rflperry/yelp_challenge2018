=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican John Boozman gave it up to run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman.  He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold. In the June runoff, he defeated State Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe 52%-48%.In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.


==== 2012 ====

Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid.  However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record.  As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November. He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
In 2011, Womack filed an amendment to a spending bill in an attempt to defund Barack Obama's teleprompter.On February 14, 2013, Womack sponsored H.R. 684, the Marketplace Fairness Act of 2013, a bill that would allow states to charge and collect sales taxes on internet purchases.  Supporters say the bill will create a "level playing field" between online retailers and brick and mortar retailers, while opponents argue that the bill would increase the power of the states, threaten consumer privacy, increase taxes, and hurt small businesses.In 2010 Womack signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.In a 2015 episode of his show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, John Oliver criticized Womack for blocking the enforcement of laws proposed by the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration that would have protected chicken farmers from being threatened or punished by the companies they work for if they spoke out regarding their farming experiences.In December 2017, Womack voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Womack supports cutting taxes and making the tax filing process easier. He believes that the act will let people "keep more of their paycheck, creates jobs and increases wages by making American businesses competitive again, and simplifies a code that has become riddled with loopholes."

=== Elections ===


==== 2010 ====

In late 2009, Womack jumped into the race for the 3rd District after incumbent Republican John Boozman gave it up to run for the United States Senate. The 3rd is one of the most Republican districts in the South and the nation (Republicans have held it since 1967), and it was generally believed whoever won the Republican primary would be the district's next congressman.  He ranked first in the seven-candidate primary with 31% of the vote, failing to reach the 50% threshold. In the June runoff, he defeated State Senator and fellow Rogers resident Cecile Bledsoe 52%-48%.In the general election, Womack defeated Democratic nominee David Whitaker, 72%-28%.


==== 2012 ====

Womack was originally set to face veteran Ken Aden in his re-election bid.  However, on July 8, Aden withdrew from the race after admitting to exaggerating his military record.  As it was too late to select a replacement candidate for Aden (under Arkansas law, the Democratic Party could only name a replacement at that late date if the original candidate died, moved out of the district or opted to seek another office), Womack faced no major-party opposition in November. He won re-election to a second term with 76% of the vote.

Supporters say the bill will create a "level playing field" between online retailers and brick and mortar retailers, while opponents argue that the bill would increase the power of the states, threaten consumer privacy, increase taxes, and hurt small businesses.In 2010 Womack signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.In a 2015 episode of his show Last Week Tonight with John Oliver, John Oliver criticized Womack for blocking the enforcement of laws proposed by the Grain Inspection, Packers and Stockyards Administration that would have protected chicken farmers from being threatened or punished by the companies they work for if they spoke out regarding their farming experiences.In December 2017, Womack voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. Womack supports cutting taxes and making the tax filing process easier.
