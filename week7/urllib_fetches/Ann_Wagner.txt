Anthony List. She won the four-way Republican primary—the de facto election given the lack of support for the Democratic nominee, Glenn Koenen —with 66% of the vote. In November, she won the general election by 23 points.Wagner is the third Republican woman elected to Congress from Missouri (after Jo Ann Emerson and Vicky Hartzler), and the second who was not elected as a stand-in for her husband (after Hartzler; Emerson was originally elected to finish out the term of her late husband, Bill Emerson).


=== 2014 ===

In her first bid for reelection, Wagner ran unopposed in the Republican primary and proceeded to easily win the general election while simultaneously increasing her margin of victory from her first election in 2012.


=== 2016 ===


=== Tenure ===
The following is an incomplete list of legislation sponsored by Rep. Wagner.

Retail Investor Protection Act (H.R. 2374; 113th Congress) – a bill that would delay the Department of Labor's regulations on when a financial advisor must be considered a fiduciary.
Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4225; 113th Congress) – a bill that would prohibit knowingly benefiting financially from, receiving anything of value from, or distributing advertising that offers a commercial sex act in a manner that violates federal criminal code prohibitions against sex trafficking of children or of any person by force, fraud, or coercion. The bill would make it a felony to post prostitution ads online. Wagner said that Congress was "taking steps towards ending what I would call modern-day slavery." Wagner argued that her bill had been reviewed by the Justice Department in an attempt to ensure that it did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's guarantee of the right to free speech. Wagner argued that the House had not passed any legislation on human trafficking in 13 years, and that "our efforts to combat sex trafficking need to be updated to match the problem as it stands today."
Retail Investor Protection Act (HR 1090; 114th Congress)—a revised version of legislation sponsored by Rep. Wagner that would delay the DOL's regulations regarding fiduciary advisors passed the U.S. House of Representatives on October 27, 2015 by a vote of 245-186.

== Personal life ==
Ann is married to Ray Wagner Jr, a former Missouri Director of Revenue. They live in Ballwin, a western suburb of St. Louis.
The Wagners have three children: Raymond III (Married to Julia, [née: Grawe] of St. Louis, Missouri), a West Point graduate and U.S. Army Ranger, Stephen, a graduate of Washington University in St. Louis and Mary Ruth, a graduate of Miami University.Ann's mother-in-law was Loretto Wagner, a noted pro-life activist, who died on June 17, 2015, of complications from diabetes at age 81.


== Recent events ==
In a 2011 RNC debate, she stated that her favorite book was Decision Points, by George W. Bush.In 2016, Wagner made headlines by withdrawing her endorsement for the GOP nominee for President, Donald Trump. Wagner's position on Trump changed several times since her initial endorsement in September; in October she withdrew her support and called on Trump to step down, but in November walked that statement back and voiced her intent to vote for Trump.Wagner has consistently opposed financial regulations, including retirement investment rules that require brokers to put their clients' best interests before their own profits. Wagner has worked with the Trump Administration to target financial oversight rules. On February 3, 2017, Wagner appeared in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump during the signing of executive orders to examine a repeal of the popular Dodd-Frank financial regulatory package, as well as to delay the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary standard, which requires that financial advisors act in their clients' best interests and disclose all fees. Wagner, who has been a vocal and consistent opponent of the fiduciary rule, was invited by President Trump to explain the rule to the White House press pool. She said to the assembled reporters, "What we're doing, is we are returning to the American people, low and middle income investors and retirees their own control over their own retirement savings." President Trump then congratulated her, calling her a "very special person." Critics argue that this change allows brokers to conceal kickbacks and conflicts of interest from investors.More recently, Wagner's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have led local newspapers to accuse her of playing "swamp politics." Since she formed her Congressional campaign committee in 2011, Wagner has received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from employees of investment and insurance companies.Wagner was among the first members of Congress to sponsor the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, which weakens oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, allows greater risk-taking by financial institutions, and eliminates the requirement that financial advisors act in their clients' best interests.On May 4, 2017, Wagner voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare.In the 2018 Missouri Republican primary election, Wagner defeated political novice Noga Sachs, and now faces Democratic challenger Cort VanOstran in the November general election.

During her third term, the party held its majorities in both chambers and also took the Governor's seat for the first time in 12 years with the election of Matt Blunt in 2004, giving the GOP complete control of state government for the first time since 1921. Her six years as chairperson witnessed George W. Bush carry Missouri in both of his presidential bids and also saw the Republican Party win a majority of the state's congressional delegation.

=== 2016 ===


=== Tenure ===
The following is an incomplete list of legislation sponsored by Rep. Wagner.

Retail Investor Protection Act (H.R. 2374; 113th Congress) – a bill that would delay the Department of Labor's regulations on when a financial advisor must be considered a fiduciary.
Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act of 2014 (H.R. 4225; 113th Congress) – a bill that would prohibit knowingly benefiting financially from, receiving anything of value from, or distributing advertising that offers a commercial sex act in a manner that violates federal criminal code prohibitions against sex trafficking of children or of any person by force, fraud, or coercion. The bill would make it a felony to post prostitution ads online. Wagner said that Congress was "taking steps towards ending what I would call modern-day slavery." Wagner argued that her bill had been reviewed by the Justice Department in an attempt to ensure that it did not violate the First Amendment to the United States Constitution's guarantee of the right to free speech. Wagner argued that the House had not passed any legislation on human trafficking in 13 years, and that "our efforts to combat sex trafficking need to be updated to match the problem as it stands today."
Retail Investor Protection Act (HR 1090; 114th Congress)—a revised version of legislation sponsored by Rep. Wagner that would delay the DOL's regulations regarding fiduciary advisors passed the U.S. House of Representatives on October 27, 2015 by a vote of 245-186.

== Recent events ==
In a 2011 RNC debate, she stated that her favorite book was Decision Points, by George W. Bush.In 2016, Wagner made headlines by withdrawing her endorsement for the GOP nominee for President, Donald Trump. Wagner's position on Trump changed several times since her initial endorsement in September; in October she withdrew her support and called on Trump to step down, but in November walked that statement back and voiced her intent to vote for Trump.Wagner has consistently opposed financial regulations, including retirement investment rules that require brokers to put their clients' best interests before their own profits. Wagner has worked with the Trump Administration to target financial oversight rules. On February 3, 2017, Wagner appeared in the Oval Office with President Donald Trump during the signing of executive orders to examine a repeal of the popular Dodd-Frank financial regulatory package, as well as to delay the Department of Labor's proposed fiduciary standard, which requires that financial advisors act in their clients' best interests and disclose all fees. Wagner, who has been a vocal and consistent opponent of the fiduciary rule, was invited by President Trump to explain the rule to the White House press pool. She said to the assembled reporters, "What we're doing, is we are returning to the American people, low and middle income investors and retirees their own control over their own retirement savings." President Trump then congratulated her, calling her a "very special person." Critics argue that this change allows brokers to conceal kickbacks and conflicts of interest from investors.More recently, Wagner's efforts to undermine the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau have led local newspapers to accuse her of playing "swamp politics." Since she formed her Congressional campaign committee in 2011, Wagner has received millions of dollars in campaign contributions from employees of investment and insurance companies.Wagner was among the first members of Congress to sponsor the Financial CHOICE Act of 2017, which weakens oversight by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, allows greater risk-taking by financial institutions, and eliminates the requirement that financial advisors act in their clients' best interests.On May 4, 2017, Wagner voted in favor of the American Health Care Act, also known as Trumpcare.In the 2018 Missouri Republican primary election, Wagner defeated political novice Noga Sachs, and now faces Democratic challenger Cort VanOstran in the November general election.
