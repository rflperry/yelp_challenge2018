Weber received endorsements from Governor Rick Perry and Ron Paul. He ranked first with 28% of the vote, but failed to reach the 50% threshold. In the run-off, he defeated Pearland City Councilwoman Felicia Harris 62%–37%. He faced former Congressman Nick Lampson in the general election; Lampson jumped into the race after the 14th had been redrawn to include much of the territory he had represented in Congress from 1997 to 2005.  In the general election held on November 6, 2012, Weber defeated Lampson by a 53% to 45% margin.
