The balanced budget amendment would require the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress for approval, but provides an exception in times of national emergencies.In April 2011, she voted for Congressman Paul Ryan's budget, which would have lowered taxes for the highest earners from 35% to 25% and also changed Medicare to be a voucher-system.

=== Immigration ===

=== Sexual abuse ===
In November 2013, Herrera Beutler co-sponsored the Military Justice Improvement Act, which would address a rise in military sexual assaults. Under the proposed law, the power to evaluate and respond to such incidents would be taken away from the military chain of command. "Despite efforts by military leadership to address this serious issue, the problem remains," she said in a news release. "A Defense Department report found that fewer than one in six cases were being reported to authorities, often due to fear of retaliation by superiors. A quarter of the time, the perpetrators of these crimes were in the victims' direct chain of command."In December 2017, President Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2018, which included part of Herrera Beutler's and Suzan DelBene's (WA-01) Child Abuse Accountability Enhancement Act (H.R. 1103). The act closed a legal loophole that denied justice to some survivors of child abuse.


== Personal life ==
In August 2008, Herrera Beutler married Daniel Beutler, who worked for SeaPort Airlines. The couple lives in Camas, Washington. In May 2013, Herrera Beutler announced they were expecting their first child. In June 2013, she announced that her unborn child had been diagnosed with Potter's Syndrome, abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal. A stranger who read the news suggested that she try an experimental treatment: saline injections into her uterus that would enable the baby to develop without  kidneys. She tried several hospitals, but none returned her calls. Finally a doctor at Johns Hopkins agreed to try. The results were instantaneous. For four weeks, she drove every morning to Baltimore for injections.She is only the ninth woman in history to give birth while serving in the United States Congress. On July 29, 2013, it was announced that the baby had been born two weeks earlier, at 28 weeks' gestation. The girl was born without kidneys, becoming the first child in recorded medical history to breathe on her own without both kidneys. In a Facebook post, Herrera Beutler said, "She is every bit a miracle." They have named the child Abigail. On July 24, 2013, Herrera Beutler was absent for a roll call vote concerning the NSA, where she cited health reasons. When she revealed the birth of her daughter, it was realized that the birth was her reason for missing what was considered an important vote.In a September 2013, Herrera Beutler announced that Abigail was getting healthier. "I'm pleased to report that her doctors are happy with her progress and optimistic about her future," she said. "Dan and I continue learning how to manage her day-to-day care while she gets healthier and overcomes her health challenges." She added that she would have to spend a lot of personal time taking care of her daughter, who is expected to be the first person in medical history to survive Potter's syndrome, but is hoping to return to the House Floor for key votes. In early December, it was announced that Herrera Beutler's daughter would be going home from the hospital, nearly 6 months after her birth.  On February 8, 2016, at the age of two, Abigail received a kidney from her father at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in California.

=== Budget ===
In 2011, she cosponsored a U.S. Constitutional Amendment that would require the federal government to balance its budget every year. The balanced budget amendment would require the President to submit a balanced budget to Congress for approval, but provides an exception in times of national emergencies.In April 2011, she voted for Congressman Paul Ryan's budget, which would have lowered taxes for the highest earners from 35% to 25% and also changed Medicare to be a voucher-system.

=== Sexual abuse ===
In November 2013, Herrera Beutler co-sponsored the Military Justice Improvement Act, which would address a rise in military sexual assaults. Under the proposed law, the power to evaluate and respond to such incidents would be taken away from the military chain of command. "Despite efforts by military leadership to address this serious issue, the problem remains," she said in a news release. "A Defense Department report found that fewer than one in six cases were being reported to authorities, often due to fear of retaliation by superiors. A quarter of the time, the perpetrators of these crimes were in the victims' direct chain of command."In December 2017, President Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2018, which included part of Herrera Beutler's and Suzan DelBene's (WA-01) Child Abuse Accountability Enhancement Act (H.R. 1103). The act closed a legal loophole that denied justice to some survivors of child abuse.

In August 2008, Herrera Beutler married Daniel Beutler, who worked for SeaPort Airlines. The couple lives in Camas, Washington. In May 2013, Herrera Beutler announced they were expecting their first child. In June 2013, she announced that her unborn child had been diagnosed with Potter's Syndrome, abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal. A stranger who read the news suggested that she try an experimental treatment: saline injections into her uterus that would enable the baby to develop without  kidneys. She tried several hospitals, but none returned her calls. Finally a doctor at Johns Hopkins agreed to try. The results were instantaneous. For four weeks, she drove every morning to Baltimore for injections.She is only the ninth woman in history to give birth while serving in the United States Congress. On July 29, 2013, it was announced that the baby had been born two weeks earlier, at 28 weeks' gestation. The girl was born without kidneys, becoming the first child in recorded medical history to breathe on her own without both kidneys. In a Facebook post, Herrera Beutler said, "She is every bit a miracle." They have named the child Abigail. On July 24, 2013, Herrera Beutler was absent for a roll call vote concerning the NSA, where she cited health reasons. When she revealed the birth of her daughter, it was realized that the birth was her reason for missing what was considered an important vote.In a September 2013, Herrera Beutler announced that Abigail was getting healthier. "I'm pleased to report that her doctors are happy with her progress and optimistic about her future," she said. "Dan and I continue learning how to manage her day-to-day care while she gets healthier and overcomes her health challenges." She added that she would have to spend a lot of personal time taking care of her daughter, who is expected to be the first person in medical history to survive Potter's syndrome, but is hoping to return to the House Floor for key votes. In early December, it was announced that Herrera Beutler's daughter would be going home from the hospital, nearly 6 months after her birth.  On February 8, 2016, at the age of two, Abigail received a kidney from her father at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in California.

Under the proposed law, the power to evaluate and respond to such incidents would be taken away from the military chain of command. "Despite efforts by military leadership to address this serious issue, the problem remains," she said in a news release. "A Defense Department report found that fewer than one in six cases were being reported to authorities, often due to fear of retaliation by superiors. A quarter of the time, the perpetrators of these crimes were in the victims' direct chain of command."In December 2017, President Trump signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2018, which included part of Herrera Beutler's and Suzan DelBene's (WA-01) Child Abuse Accountability Enhancement Act (H.R. 1103).

In June 2013, she announced that her unborn child had been diagnosed with Potter's Syndrome, abnormally low amniotic fluid caused by impaired kidney function which inhibits normal lung development and is often fatal. A stranger who read the news suggested that she try an experimental treatment: saline injections into her uterus that would enable the baby to develop without  kidneys. She tried several hospitals, but none returned her calls. Finally a doctor at Johns Hopkins agreed to try. The results were instantaneous. For four weeks, she drove every morning to Baltimore for injections.She is only the ninth woman in history to give birth while serving in the United States Congress. On July 29, 2013, it was announced that the baby had been born two weeks earlier, at 28 weeks' gestation. The girl was born without kidneys, becoming the first child in recorded medical history to breathe on her own without both kidneys. In a Facebook post, Herrera Beutler said, "She is every bit a miracle." They have named the child Abigail. On July 24, 2013, Herrera Beutler was absent for a roll call vote concerning the NSA, where she cited health reasons. When she revealed the birth of her daughter, it was realized that the birth was her reason for missing what was considered an important vote.In a September 2013, Herrera Beutler announced that Abigail was getting healthier. "I'm pleased to report that her doctors are happy with her progress and optimistic about her future," she said. "Dan and I continue learning how to manage her day-to-day care while she gets healthier and overcomes her health challenges." She added that she would have to spend a lot of personal time taking care of her daughter, who is expected to be the first person in medical history to survive Potter's syndrome, but is hoping to return to the House Floor for key votes. In early December, it was announced that Herrera Beutler's daughter would be going home from the hospital, nearly 6 months after her birth.  On February 8, 2016, at the age of two, Abigail received a kidney from her father at the Lucile Packard Children's Hospital Stanford in California.
