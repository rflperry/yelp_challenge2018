Instead, Becerra was appointed assistant to the Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress.
Before the opening of the 111th Congress, Emanuel accepted a position as White House Chief of Staff in the Obama Administration.

==== Taxes ====

Instead, Becerra was appointed assistant to the Speaker of the House for the 110th Congress.
