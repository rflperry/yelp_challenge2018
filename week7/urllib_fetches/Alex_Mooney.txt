Bartlett. In 1995 he became a legislative analyst for the Republican Conference of the U.S. House of Representatives.

Heavily Republican Carroll County, as well as more Republican portions of Baltimore, Frederick and Harford counties, were shifted out of the district, replaced by a heavily Democratic spur of Montgomery County. In 2008, Barack Obama only took 40 percent of the vote in the old 6th, but would have won 56 percent in the new 6th. After creating an exploratory committee to challenge Bartlett in the Republican primary, Mooney decided not to run against him.

=== Elections ===
2014
In March 2012, Mooney filed as a candidate in the 2014 Republican primary for Maryland's 6th congressional District. He subsequently had to withdraw his candidacy because he was still Bartlett's part-time outreach director at the time he filed papers to run. House ethics rules do not allow congressional staffers to remain employed in a congressional office while campaigning.Mooney subsequently moved to Charles Town, West Virginia, a small town on the state's eastern tip, and declared his candidacy for West Virginia's 2nd congressional district. The district includes most of the West Virginia portion of the Washington, DC, media market. Seven-term Republican incumbent Shelley Moore Capito was giving up the seat to run for the United States Senate. During his campaign, some West Virginia Democrats accused Mooney of being a "carpetbagger" since he had recently moved to West Virginia.Mooney received the Republican Party nomination on May 13, 2014, beating six other opponents in the Republican primary. Mooney finished first in 15 of the 17 counties in the congressional district, with an overall total of 36.02 percent of the vote.Mooney faced Democrat Nick Casey in the 2014 general election. On November 4, 2014, he defeated Casey, 49 percent to 47 percent. He won Berkeley County, in the state's Eastern Panhandle, by 5,000 votes, which was more than his overall margin of 4,900 votes. Berkeley, like Charles Town, is part of the Washington media market. Mooney was also helped by long coattails from Capito, who carried every county in the district (and the state).Mooney became the first Latino elected to West Virginia's congressional delegation in the state's history.
2016

Mooney ran for re-election in 2016. He defeated Marc Savitt in the May 10, 2016, Republican primary, receiving 72.9% of the vote to Savitt's 27.1%. Mooney faced Democratic state delegate Mark Hunt in the general election. Mooney defeated Hunt with 58% of the vote.


=== Tenure ===
Mooney was sworn in on January 3, 2015. On March 26, 2015, Congressman Mooney introduced H.R. 1644, the Supporting Transparent Regulatory and Environmental Actions in Mining Act (STREAM Act). The full House passed the bill on January 19, 2016, by a vote of 235-188.
