== Political positions ==


=== Abortion and Planned Parenthood ===
Walters opposes abortion, but has deemphasized the issue during her political campaigns. In 2015, during her freshman term, she served on the Select Panel to Investigate Planned Parenthood.


=== Cannabis ===
Walters has a "D" rating from the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws, an advocacy group supporting the legalization of marijuana.


=== Donald Trump ===
In July 2016, FiveThirtyEight labeled Walters an "Eager Unifier", for having endorsed Trump wholeheartedly, but not until after the Indiana primary.In February 2017, Walters voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session.FiveThirtyEight has found that Walters votes with President Trump 99% of the time, and is the eighth-most partisan Trump supporter in the House when compared to her district's voting patterns.


=== Federal taxation legislation of 2017 ===
In November 2017, Walters voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the house version of the Republican Party's tax reform bill. The House bill removes state and local tax breaks that many Californians use, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Walters said after the vote that she had received assurances from House Speaker Paul Ryan that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would restore the lost tax breaks that had been removed in the House version. According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill "contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with Californians but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level instead of cutting it in half as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare’s individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees."


=== Environment ===
In 2015, Walters sponsored and voted for H.R. 1732, a bill that opposed the Waters of the United States rule, which expands the federal government’s jurisdiction to regulate waters and certain adjacent lands.Also in 2015, Walters voted to repeal the limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants set by the Clean Power Plan. “Forcing a shift away from traditional energy resources,” she explained, “would ultimately stifle the economy for years to come and harm consumers’ pocketbooks.” Walters also co-sponsored the Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017, which became law, and which declares that there is no legal requirement to regulate global warming.Walters was originally a climate change skeptic, but she began to shift her views after meeting with the Orange County Central chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby in 2014. After they explained to her how the market-based approach of Carbon Fee and Dividend could have a positive impact on the climate without expanding government. Walters replied, "You guys are doing it the right way". In July 2017, Walters voted to veto the Perry Amendment, which would have defunded Defense Department efforts to track climate change and its threats to military bases.In October 2017, after President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, “Walters officially changed from a climate-change skeptic to a believer...and joined the Congressional Climate Solutions Caucus.


=== Healthcare ===
Walters supports the repeal of Obamacare and voted in 2015 for H.R. 596, the House bill to repeal Obamacare. She also voted for H.R. 3762, the Restoring Americans’ Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act, which would have repealed Obamacare.Walters supports repealing and replacing the Affordable Care Act (known as Obamacare) with the American Health Care Act, the GOP's replacement plan for Obamacare, which did not come to a vote initially. She said that passing the American Health Care Act "is a critical step" towards the goal of rescuing "this failing healthcare system".On May 4, 2017, Walters voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act. In early 2017, Walters tweeted that she was "committed to protecting patients w/ pre-existing conditions to ensure their access to quality, affordable healthcare". However, USA Today noted that the version of the American Health Care Act that she voted in favor of allows insurance companies to charge higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions (such as cancer, epilepsy, diabetes and pregnancy). Walters was an original cosponsor of H.R. 4684, the Access to Quality Sober Living Act, which would require the Department of Health and Human Services to establish best practices for sober living facilities for opioid addicts. This legislation was written after a subcommittee hearing exposed scams at such facilities.


=== Gun control ===
A May 2018 profile of Walters noted her longtime “reputation as a gun-rights advocate.” In the State Assembly, “she twice voted against bills requiring the microstamping of bullets from automatic firearms,” against “background checks for ammunition buyers,” against a ban on “large-capacity conversion kits,” and against “prohibiting people under domestic violence restraining orders from obtaining firearms.” But during her years in the House, “California voters’ concerns about school shootings had risen dramatically, with 73 percent of respondents admitting they were worried about a mass shooting at their public school,” with high-school students in Walters's district holding anti-gun rallies.


=== Keystone pipeline ===
Walters voted in support of the Keystone XL Pipeline Act (H.R. 3) in 2015.


=== LGBT rights ===
As an Assemblywoman, Walters endorsed Proposition 8, which declared same-sex marriage illegal in the state of California. Minority Whip Steny Hoyer (D-MD) named Walters as one of seven Republican representatives who switched their votes regarding a bill upholding an executive order prohibiting defense contractors from discriminating against people based on their sexual orientation. The identities of the seven vote-switchers were not publicly recorded and none of those named by Hoyer confirmed his claims. PBS reported that under shouts of 'shame', Walters voted against this protection, which ended up narrowly failing.


=== Military ===
In January 2018, Walters voted for H.R. 695, the 2018 Department of Defense Appropriations Act, saying that she had acted to “fully fund the Department of Defense to ensure our men and women in uniform have the tools and resources they need to keep our country safe... It is imperative our armed forces are properly equipped and ready to meet current and future challenges.”She voted against allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.


=== Nuclear waste ===
In March 2018, Walters signed a bipartisan letter in support of funding to restart the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. “Just south of California's 45th district,” she stated, “1,800 tons of spent nuclear fuel sits at the inactive San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). Unfortunately, our Nation's nuclear waste management system is broken and spent fuel sits at nuclear sites like SONGS with nowhere to go. By law, the Federal government is obligated to take ownership of, and safely store, spent fuel at a permanent repository.”


=== Strikes ===
In 2014, Walters voted for a bill in committee that banned public transit workers from going on strike.


=== Human trafficking ===
In February 2018, the House passed H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), introduced by Walters, Ann Wagner (R-Missouri), and Carolyn Maloney (D-New York). It included an amendment written by Walters that would permit enforcement of criminal and civil sex trafficking laws against websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. The amended legislation passed with bipartisan support.


== Personal life ==
Walters is married and has four children. Her husband, David, is the owner of a boutique investment bank, Monarch Bay Associates. In 2010, financial disclosure forms showed that Mimi Walters' holdings include between $100,000 and $1 million in Goldman Sachs.

In July 2016, FiveThirtyEight labeled Walters an "Eager Unifier", for having endorsed Trump wholeheartedly, but not until after the Indiana primary.In February 2017, Walters voted against a resolution that would have directed the House to request 10 years of Trump's tax returns, which would then have been reviewed by the House Ways and Means Committee in a closed session.FiveThirtyEight has found that Walters votes with President Trump 99% of the time, and is the eighth-most partisan Trump supporter in the House when compared to her district's voting patterns.


=== Federal taxation legislation of 2017 ===
In November 2017, Walters voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, the house version of the Republican Party's tax reform bill. The House bill removes state and local tax breaks that many Californians use, such as the mortgage interest deduction. Several House Republicans representing Californian districts voted against the legislation because it raised taxes on Californians. Walters said after the vote that she had received assurances from House Speaker Paul Ryan that a reconciliation version of the bill with the Senate would restore the lost tax breaks that had been removed in the House version. According to the Los Angeles Times, immediately after the vote, the Senate version of the bill "contains even deeper cuts to state and local tax breaks that are popular with Californians but maintains the mortgage interest deduction at its current level instead of cutting it in half as the House plan does. It also repeals Obamacare’s individual mandate, a move that could further complicate the situation for California members who represent districts with a lot of Obamacare enrollees."

In 2015, Walters sponsored and voted for H.R. 1732, a bill that opposed the Waters of the United States rule, which expands the federal government’s jurisdiction to regulate waters and certain adjacent lands.Also in 2015, Walters voted to repeal the limits on carbon dioxide emissions from power plants set by the Clean Power Plan. “Forcing a shift away from traditional energy resources,” she explained, “would ultimately stifle the economy for years to come and harm consumers’ pocketbooks.” Walters also co-sponsored the Stopping EPA Overreach Act of 2017, which became law, and which declares that there is no legal requirement to regulate global warming.Walters was originally a climate change skeptic, but she began to shift her views after meeting with the Orange County Central chapter of the Citizens' Climate Lobby in 2014. After they explained to her how the market-based approach of Carbon Fee and Dividend could have a positive impact on the climate without expanding government. Walters replied, "You guys are doing it the right way". In July 2017, Walters voted to veto the Perry Amendment, which would have defunded Defense Department efforts to track climate change and its threats to military bases.In October 2017, after President Trump pulled out of the Paris Agreement, “Walters officially changed from a climate-change skeptic to a believer...and joined the Congressional Climate Solutions Caucus.

She said that passing the American Health Care Act "is a critical step" towards the goal of rescuing "this failing healthcare system".On May 4, 2017, Walters voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass the American Health Care Act. In early 2017, Walters tweeted that she was "committed to protecting patients w/ pre-existing conditions to ensure their access to quality, affordable healthcare". However, USA Today noted that the version of the American Health Care Act that she voted in favor of allows insurance companies to charge higher premiums to individuals with pre-existing conditions (such as cancer, epilepsy, diabetes and pregnancy). Walters was an original cosponsor of H.R. 4684, the Access to Quality Sober Living Act, which would require the Department of Health and Human Services to establish best practices for sober living facilities for opioid addicts. This legislation was written after a subcommittee hearing exposed scams at such facilities.


=== Gun control ===
A May 2018 profile of Walters noted her longtime “reputation as a gun-rights advocate.” In the State Assembly, “she twice voted against bills requiring the microstamping of bullets from automatic firearms,” against “background checks for ammunition buyers,” against a ban on “large-capacity conversion kits,” and against “prohibiting people under domestic violence restraining orders from obtaining firearms.” But during her years in the House, “California voters’ concerns about school shootings had risen dramatically, with 73 percent of respondents admitting they were worried about a mass shooting at their public school,” with high-school students in Walters's district holding anti-gun rallies.

It is imperative our armed forces are properly equipped and ready to meet current and future challenges.”She voted against allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation.


=== Nuclear waste ===
In March 2018, Walters signed a bipartisan letter in support of funding to restart the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. “Just south of California's 45th district,” she stated, “1,800 tons of spent nuclear fuel sits at the inactive San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). Unfortunately, our Nation's nuclear waste management system is broken and spent fuel sits at nuclear sites like SONGS with nowhere to go. By law, the Federal government is obligated to take ownership of, and safely store, spent fuel at a permanent repository.”

In 2014, Walters voted for a bill in committee that banned public transit workers from going on strike.


=== Human trafficking ===

In March 2018, Walters signed a bipartisan letter in support of funding to restart the licensing process for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository. “Just south of California's 45th district,” she stated, “1,800 tons of spent nuclear fuel sits at the inactive San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station (SONGS). Unfortunately, our Nation's nuclear waste management system is broken and spent fuel sits at nuclear sites like SONGS with nowhere to go. By law, the Federal government is obligated to take ownership of, and safely store, spent fuel at a permanent repository.”


=== Strikes ===
In 2014, Walters voted for a bill in committee that banned public transit workers from going on strike.


=== Human trafficking ===
In February 2018, the House passed H.R. 1865, the Allow States and Victims to Fight Online Sex Trafficking Act (FOSTA), introduced by Walters, Ann Wagner (R-Missouri), and Carolyn Maloney (D-New York). It included an amendment written by Walters that would permit enforcement of criminal and civil sex trafficking laws against websites that facilitate online sex trafficking. The amended legislation passed with bipartisan support.
