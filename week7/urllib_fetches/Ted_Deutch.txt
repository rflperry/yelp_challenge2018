In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Deutch spoke out in favor of expanded gun control legislation. He spoke at a CNN town hall meeting and urged action. "A lot of people have told this community -- people from all around the world -- that it's too soon," he said. "It's too soon to get together to have this kind of forum. It's too soon to talk about preventing another tragedy like the one that struck our community from happening anywhere again. It's too soon to talk about getting weapons of war out of our communities. It is not too soon. It is too late for the 17 lives that were lost."

Deutch introduced a resolution proposing "an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to expressly exclude for-profit corporations from the rights given to natural persons by the Constitution of the United States, prohibit corporate spending in all elections, and affirm the authority of Congress and the states to regulate corporations and to regulate and set limits on all election contributions and expenditures".
Rep. Deutch’s amendment is a blend of "ideas from "Move to Amend, Free Speech for People, Public Citizen, People For the American Way, Common Cause, and the Center for Media and Democracy".

=== Gun policy ===
Deutch believes that acceptable limitations can be placed on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, saying, "the majority of people in this country now understand that there are limitations on the Second Amendment.  You cannot own an automatic weapon.  You cannot own a bazooka.  And so there is no reason to continue to sell to people a weapon of war like this," referencing semi-automatic rifles.
During his tenure as Congressman, Deutch has voted on several pieces of gun legislation.
He voted against H. R. 38 (the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act), which would enable concealed carry reciprocity among all States if and when it is signed into law.
Deutch also voted against H. J. Res. 40, which ultimately passed and used the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of an Obama-era Amendment to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 that was aimed at preventing the mentally-infirm from legally purchasing firearms.
Deutch has an "F" rating from the NRA, indicating that it does not believe he adequately supports gun rights.After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Deutch endorsed several gun control measures.
Deutch cosponsored H. R. 5087, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018, saying, "Americans don't own tanks or missiles; so why should our streets be flooded with weapons of war made for the sole purpose of killing people?"
Deutch also announced his support for H. R. 4909, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018.
The STOP School Violence Act would allow grants to train school staff how to identify troubled students and intervene before crises.
The grants could also be used for developing an anonymous reporting system for students to submit concerns, as well as improving the physical infrastructure of schools against attacks.
Deutch also supports universal background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the minimum age to buy a rifle to 21, and repealing the 1996 Dickey Amendment. In May 2018 he advocated for the complete ban of all semi automatic weapons.


== Congressional Hellenic Israel Alliance ==
In 2013, a bipartisan congressional group of Greek-American and Jewish-American members was created by Deutch and Gus Bilirakis, a Republican representative from Florida.

In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Deutch spoke out in favor of expanded gun control legislation. He spoke at a CNN town hall meeting and urged action. "A lot of people have told this community -- people from all around the world -- that it's too soon," he said. "It's too soon to get together to have this kind of forum. It's too soon to talk about preventing another tragedy like the one that struck our community from happening anywhere again. It's too soon to talk about getting weapons of war out of our communities. It is not too soon. It is too late for the 17 lives that were lost."

Deutch introduced a resolution proposing "an amendment to the Constitution of the United States to expressly exclude for-profit corporations from the rights given to natural persons by the Constitution of the United States, prohibit corporate spending in all elections, and affirm the authority of Congress and the states to regulate corporations and to regulate and set limits on all election contributions and expenditures".

Deutch believes that acceptable limitations can be placed on the Second Amendment right to bear arms, saying, "the majority of people in this country now understand that there are limitations on the Second Amendment.  You cannot own an automatic weapon.  You cannot own a bazooka.  And so there is no reason to continue to sell to people a weapon of war like this," referencing semi-automatic rifles.
During his tenure as Congressman, Deutch has voted on several pieces of gun legislation.
He voted against H. R. 38 (the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act), which would enable concealed carry reciprocity among all States if and when it is signed into law.
Deutch also voted against H. J. Res. 40, which ultimately passed and used the Congressional Review Act to block implementation of an Obama-era Amendment to the NICS Improvement Amendments Act of 2007 that was aimed at preventing the mentally-infirm from legally purchasing firearms.
Deutch has an "F" rating from the NRA, indicating that it does not believe he adequately supports gun rights.After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Deutch endorsed several gun control measures.
Deutch cosponsored H. R. 5087, the Assault Weapons Ban of 2018, saying, "Americans don't own tanks or missiles; so why should our streets be flooded with weapons of war made for the sole purpose of killing people?"
Deutch also announced his support for H. R. 4909, the STOP School Violence Act of 2018.
The STOP School Violence Act would allow grants to train school staff how to identify troubled students and intervene before crises.
The grants could also be used for developing an anonymous reporting system for students to submit concerns, as well as improving the physical infrastructure of schools against attacks.
Deutch also supports universal background checks, banning bump stocks, raising the minimum age to buy a rifle to 21, and repealing the 1996 Dickey Amendment. In May 2018 he advocated for the complete ban of all semi automatic weapons.
