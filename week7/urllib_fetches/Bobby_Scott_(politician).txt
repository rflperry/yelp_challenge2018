1992In 1992, the Department of Justice directed the Virginia legislature to draw a black-majority district after the 1990 census.  The legislature responded by shifting most of the black residents of Hampton Roads and Richmond into a newly created 3rd District.  Scott won a three-way Democratic primary with 67% of the vote, which was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. In the general election, he defeated Republican Dan Jenkins 79%-21%.
1994-2008During this time period, he won re-election every two years with at least 76% of the vote, except in 2004. That year, he was challenged by Republican Winsome Sears, a former State Delegate.

In regards to the bill, Lee said that "it is important that we put in place a safety net for those still looking for work. We cannot and will not allow our fellow Americans to fall by the wayside. Congressman Scott and I plan to continue to push for passage of this legislation because it is simply the right thing to do."Scott was an outspoken opponent of the Bush administration. He opposed the Patriot Act explaining that officials may abuse the power by promoting anti-terrorist security and develop unfair "racial profiling".

== Possible U.S. Senate appointment ==
On July 22, 2016, then-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced that she had chosen Tim Kaine, a U.S. Senator from Virginia, as her running mate.  Had the Clinton-Kaine ticket won the general election, Kaine would have resigned his Senate seat, and Democratic Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe would have been able to appoint a replacement to serve until a 2017 special election.  In August 2016, former Democratic governor Douglas Wilder stated that he would want McAuliffe to appoint Scott to the seat, stating that it "would be good for the commonwealth, good for the Democratic Party, of which Bobby has been most supportive, and great for our nation." On November 8, however, Clinton and Kaine lost the presidency to Donald Trump and Mike Pence, so Kaine remained in his Senate seat and an appointment was not necessary.

== Sexual harassment allegation ==
On December 15, 2017, Marsheri Everson (also known as M. Reese Everson), a former congressional fellow who had worked in Scott's office, alleged that Scott had sexually harassed her in 2013 by making inappropriate comments and touching her on the knee and back on separate occasions.  Scott dismissed Everson's accusation as a "false allegation."  Everson provided details of her claim at a news conference in Arlington, in which she appeared with attorney Jack Burkman, best known for his involvement in the conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich.A December 22, 2017 story in the Richmond Free Press questioned Everson's allegations. "Since 2015, Ms. Everson has told at least three different versions of events... In Facebook posts and in comments to the Free Press and other media outlets, scores of people have expressed certainty that Ms. Everson is more a fabricator than a truth teller."  Among the details that suggested conflicting accounts by Everson was that on November 19, 2010, the Inspector General's Office for the city of Chicago placed Everson on the city's "do not hire" list indefinitely (a permanent ban) after she was fired from their office.  In response, in 2011, Everson sued, accusing her former supervisor of sexual harassment; she dropped the suit after going to work at the U.S. House of Representatives.  In October 2013, Everson was dismissed from her fellowship with the House Financial Services Committee.  She had begun work for the committee after leaving Scott's office.  Before leaving Scott's office, she had a going away party with members of his staff; after leaving, she contacted Scott to thank him for the opportunity.  In neither case did she mention inappropriate conduct by Scott.  Further detracting from Everson's account of her interactions with Scott was a December 31, 2017 New York Times story that included Burkman in its discussion of politically motivated sexual harassment claims.

1992In 1992, the Department of Justice directed the Virginia legislature to draw a black-majority district after the 1990 census.  The legislature responded by shifting most of the black residents of Hampton Roads and Richmond into a newly created 3rd District.  Scott won a three-way Democratic primary with 67% of the vote, which was tantamount to election in this heavily Democratic district. In the general election, he defeated Republican Dan Jenkins 79%-21%.
1994-2008During this time period, he won re-election every two years with at least 76% of the vote, except in 2004. That year, he was challenged by Republican Winsome Sears, a former State Delegate. He won with 69% of the vote, the lowest winning percentage of his career. In 1994, Scott won 79.44% of the vote, defeating Republican Thomas E. Ward.

2010
Scott was challenged by Republican Chuck Smith, a former JAG. Scott defeated him 70%-27%, the second worst performance of his career.

Scott's congressional district is the only one with a majority black population in Virginia. The district was created in 1992 and has remained the most Democratic district in Virginia.Scott's annual Labor Day picnic, generally held at his mother's residence in Newport News, is a major campaign stop for statewide and federal candidates in Virginia.

Scott has voted progressively in the House of Representatives.  He has supported increases in the minimum wage and has worked to eliminate anti-gay bias in the workplace.  In 2010, Scott co-sponsored the "Lee-Scott bill" with Barbara Lee to make it easier on individuals who had been on unemployment for 99 weeks without finding work. In regards to the bill, Lee said that "it is important that we put in place a safety net for those still looking for work. We cannot and will not allow our fellow Americans to fall by the wayside. Congressman Scott and I plan to continue to push for passage of this legislation because it is simply the right thing to do."Scott was an outspoken opponent of the Bush administration. He opposed the Patriot Act explaining that officials may abuse the power by promoting anti-terrorist security and develop unfair "racial profiling". In 2002 Scott voted nay on the Iraq war resolution and did not support any of the Bush Doctrine in reference to the Iraq war.

== Possible U.S. Senate appointment ==
On July 22, 2016, then-presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton announced that she had chosen Tim Kaine, a U.S. Senator from Virginia, as her running mate.  Had the Clinton-Kaine ticket won the general election, Kaine would have resigned his Senate seat, and Democratic Governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe would have been able to appoint a replacement to serve until a 2017 special election.  In August 2016, former Democratic governor Douglas Wilder stated that he would want McAuliffe to appoint Scott to the seat, stating that it "would be good for the commonwealth, good for the Democratic Party, of which Bobby has been most supportive, and great for our nation." On November 8, however, Clinton and Kaine lost the presidency to Donald Trump and Mike Pence, so Kaine remained in his Senate seat and an appointment was not necessary.

== Sexual harassment allegation ==
On December 15, 2017, Marsheri Everson (also known as M. Reese Everson), a former congressional fellow who had worked in Scott's office, alleged that Scott had sexually harassed her in 2013 by making inappropriate comments and touching her on the knee and back on separate occasions.  Scott dismissed Everson's accusation as a "false allegation."  Everson provided details of her claim at a news conference in Arlington, in which she appeared with attorney Jack Burkman, best known for his involvement in the conspiracy theories surrounding the murder of Seth Rich.A December 22, 2017 story in the Richmond Free Press questioned Everson's allegations. "Since 2015, Ms. Everson has told at least three different versions of events... In Facebook posts and in comments to the Free Press and other media outlets, scores of people have expressed certainty that Ms. Everson is more a fabricator than a truth teller."  Among the details that suggested conflicting accounts by Everson was that on November 19, 2010, the Inspector General's Office for the city of Chicago placed Everson on the city's "do not hire" list indefinitely (a permanent ban) after she was fired from their office.  In response, in 2011, Everson sued, accusing her former supervisor of sexual harassment; she dropped the suit after going to work at the U.S. House of Representatives.  In October 2013, Everson was dismissed from her fellowship with the House Financial Services Committee.  She had begun work for the committee after leaving Scott's office.  Before leaving Scott's office, she had a going away party with members of his staff; after leaving, she contacted Scott to thank him for the opportunity.  In neither case did she mention inappropriate conduct by Scott.  Further detracting from Everson's account of her interactions with Scott was a December 31, 2017 New York Times story that included Burkman in its discussion of politically motivated sexual harassment claims.

Before leaving Scott's office, she had a going away party with members of his staff; after leaving, she contacted Scott to thank him for the opportunity.  In neither case did she mention inappropriate conduct by Scott.  Further detracting from Everson's account of her interactions with Scott was a December 31, 2017 New York Times story that included Burkman in its discussion of politically motivated sexual harassment claims.
