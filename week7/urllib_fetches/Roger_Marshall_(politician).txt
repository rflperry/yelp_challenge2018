Marshall supports repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. Like many other Republicans who want the "health care system to rely on the free market rather than Obamacare's regulations", Marshall "measures success in how many people can afford to leave the Medicaid program and enter the private insurance market." In opposing the Act's Medicaid expansion, Marshall said in an interview in March 2017, "Just, like, homeless people... I think just morally, spiritually, socially, (some people) just don't want health care. The Medicaid population, which is [on] a free credit card, as a group, do probably the least preventive medicine and taking care of themselves and eating healthy and exercising. And I'm not judging, I'm just saying socially that's where they are. So there's a group of people that even with unlimited access to health care are only going to use the emergency room when their arm is chopped off or when their pneumonia is so bad they get brought [into] the ER." Those who support Medicaid, say that Marshall did not understand how Kansas Medicaid operates. The program provides "medical coverage for low-income families and disabled Kansans". Marshall's remark attracted widespread attention and criticism.

=== Social issues ===


==== Abortion ====
Marshall is anti-abortion.


==== Cannabis ====
Marshall is not "convinced" that medical marijuana is safe and provides medicinal benefits. In early 2017, he stated "I'm not convinced yet so I'm going to be very cautious," regarding the legalization of medical marijuana, "I think there's a path there, but I just haven't seen enough scientific data to say it's a good thing,"
