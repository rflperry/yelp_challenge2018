He continued his political career in the 2000s, chairing George W. Bush's election campaigns in 2000 and 2004, as well as chairing the campaign of Lamar Alexander for one of Tennessee's seats in the U.S. Senate in 2002.Kustoff unsuccessfully ran for Congress in the Republican primary for Tennessee's 7th congressional district in 2002.

== U.S. Attorney ==

== 2016 congressional campaign ==


=== Republican primary ===
In February 2016, Stephen Fincher announced that he would not run for re-election in Tennessee's 8th congressional district.  Redistricting four years earlier had shifted eastern Memphis and most of its suburbs to the 8th. Kustoff joined a crowded Republican primary—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. He faced off against local leaders such as Shelby County Mayor Mark Luttrell, physician and former County Commissioner George Flinn, Shelby County Register of Deeds Tom Leatherwood, and State Senator Brian Kelsey. Flinn self-financed his campaign, spending $2.9 million, much of which went to TV ads.Kustoff emphasized the themes of law and order and reducing crime, as well as campaigning on reducing illegal immigration and bringing down West Tennessee's high poverty rate. He praised Tennessee Governor Bill Haslam's Tennessee Promise program, which offers two years of free community college education to qualifying Tennessee residents. Kustoff began to emerge from the crowded pack when he was endorsed by former Arkansas Governor and Republican Presidential candidate Mike Huckabee, who filmed ads for Kustoff and campaigned with him. Kustoff won the Republican primary, outperforming better-funded and more well-known candidates. The race reflected the lowest primary turnout in the district since 2004.


=== General election ===
Kustoff faced Democrat Rickey Hobson, a Delta Air Lines manager and Somerville, Tennessee resident. This district is one of the most Republican districts in the nation, and Kustoff was heavily favored to win. In spite of this, Kustoff ran an active campaign, kicking off a tour of the district's 15 counties and urging skeptical Republicans to support Donald Trump for the presidency. Kustoff defeated Hobson in the general election.


== Political stances ==


=== National security ===
Kustoff supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that “I believe President Trump is putting American safety first, and I will encourage a long-term plan that is consistent with the values and compassion on which our great nation was founded.”


=== Health care ===
Kustoff voted for the American Health Care Act in May 2017. "[O]ur current health care system is failing Tennesseans", he said afterwards. Later that month, a woman angrily confronted him about that vote during a town hall meeting at the University of Tennessee at Martin; after the meeting ended and Kustoff along with some of his staff got into their car, she gave chase and allegedly attempted to run them off the road, then confronted them again about Kustoff's vote, reportedly banging on the windows of his car in the process. Police later arrested her on a felony charge of reckless endangerment.
