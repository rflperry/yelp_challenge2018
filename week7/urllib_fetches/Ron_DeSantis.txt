=== Legislation ===
On January 29, 2014, DeSantis introduced into the House the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 3973; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Justice to report to the United States Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason. In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that "President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda. ... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why."In 2013, DeSantis signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.On August 24, 2017, DeSantis added a rider to the proposed fiscal 2018 spending bill package that would end funding for the 2017 Special Counsel investigation "or for the investigation under that order of matters occurring before June 2015" (the month Trump announced he was running for president) 180 days after passage of the bill.The amendment would counter a bipartisan bill authored by two Democratic and two Republican U.S. Senators that was meant to limit the president's power to fire the special counsel. The DeSantis amendment would potentially cut off funding for the investigation by November 2017. It was also a response to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's statement that the DOJ, "doesn't conduct fishing expeditions." DeSantis stated that the May 17, 2017 DOJ order "didn't identify a crime to be investigated and practically invites a fishing expedition."He is a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of congressional conservatives.


== 2016 U.S. Senate candidacy ==

On May 6, 2015, DeSantis announced that he was running for the United States Senate seat held by Marco Rubio, who initially did not file to run for re-election due to his bid for the U.S. presidency. He was endorsed by the fiscally conservative Club for Growth.DeSantis withdrew from the race following incumbent Senator Marco Rubio's announcement that he would seek reelection to the Senate, reversing his initial pledge not to run, on June 22, 2016. After dropping his U.S. Senate bid, DeSantis filed to run for re-election to his U.S. House seat.


== 2018 gubernatorial candidacy ==

In January 2018, DeSantis announced his candidacy for Governor of Florida to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. President Donald Trump stated in December 2017 that he would support DeSantis should he run for Governor. During the Republican primary, DeSantis emphasized his support for Trump by running an ad where DeSantis taught his children how to "build the wall" and say "Make America Great Again" and by dressing one of his children in a tiny red "Make America Great Again" jumper. Asked if he could name an issue where he disagreed with Trump, DeSantis did not name a single issue. On July 30, 2018, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times wrote that the support DeSantis's primary campaign had received demonstrated both Trump's kingmaking capacity in a Republican-trending state but also a "broader nationalization of conservative politics" wherein "a willingness to hurl rhetorical lightning bolts at the left, the media and special counsel Robert S. Mueller can override local credentials, local endorsements and preparedness for a state-based job."On August 28, 2018, DeSantis won the Republican primary. His Democratic opponent in the general election is Andrew Gillum. The race is "widely seen as a toss-up."DeSantis’s gubernatorial platform includes support for legislation that would allow persons with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms openly. He also supports a law mandating the use of E-verify by businesses and a state-level ban on "sanctuary-city" protections for undocumented immigrants. DeSantis has promised to stop the spread of polluted water from Lake Okeechobee.

DeSantis has stated that he would implement a medical marijuana program, but opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana.On August 29, 2018, DeSantis came under fire for comments that were allegedly racially charged. DeSantis said: "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state. That is not going to work. That's not going to be good for Florida." DeSantis was accused of using the verb monkey as a racist dog whistle; his opponent, Gillum, is African-American. Amid the controversy over DeSantis' comments, the Washington Post and the Naples Daily News reported that DeSantis had on four occasions appeared at racially charged conferences at the David Horowitz Freedom Center that featured various right-wing provocateurs as speakers. DeSantis has stated that his comment had "'zero to do with race.'"In September 2018, DeSantis announced state Rep. Jeanette Nunez as his running mate. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on September 10, 2018, to focus on his gubernatorial candidacy. That same month, DeSantis was criticized for not having a fully-formed policy platform for his gubernatorial campaign.

In addition, this provision would prohibit Mueller from investigating matters that occurred before June 2015, when Trump launched his presidential campaign. In December 2017, DeSantis asserted that if there was any evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials, it would already have been leaked.In January 2018, while on the House Intelligence Committee, DeSantis voted on party lines to release a classified memo authored by Republicans on the committee which purported to show that the FBI abused its surveillance powers in the Russia investigation.

In addition, this provision would prohibit Mueller from investigating matters that occurred before June 2015, when Trump launched his presidential campaign. In December 2017, DeSantis asserted that if there was any evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials, it would already have been leaked.In January 2018, while on the House Intelligence Committee, DeSantis voted on party lines to release a classified memo authored by Republicans on the committee which purported to show that the FBI abused its surveillance powers in the Russia investigation.

=== Legislation ===
On January 29, 2014, DeSantis introduced into the House the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 3973; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Justice to report to the United States Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason. In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that "President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda. ... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why."In 2013, DeSantis signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.On August 24, 2017, DeSantis added a rider to the proposed fiscal 2018 spending bill package that would end funding for the 2017 Special Counsel investigation "or for the investigation under that order of matters occurring before June 2015" (the month Trump announced he was running for president) 180 days after passage of the bill.The amendment would counter a bipartisan bill authored by two Democratic and two Republican U.S. Senators that was meant to limit the president's power to fire the special counsel. The DeSantis amendment would potentially cut off funding for the investigation by November 2017. It was also a response to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's statement that the DOJ, "doesn't conduct fishing expeditions." DeSantis stated that the May 17, 2017 DOJ order "didn't identify a crime to be investigated and practically invites a fishing expedition."He is a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of congressional conservatives.


== 2016 U.S. Senate candidacy ==

On May 6, 2015, DeSantis announced that he was running for the United States Senate seat held by Marco Rubio, who initially did not file to run for re-election due to his bid for the U.S. presidency.

After dropping his U.S. Senate bid, DeSantis filed to run for re-election to his U.S. House seat.


== 2018 gubernatorial candidacy ==

In January 2018, DeSantis announced his candidacy for Governor of Florida to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. President Donald Trump stated in December 2017 that he would support DeSantis should he run for Governor. During the Republican primary, DeSantis emphasized his support for Trump by running an ad where DeSantis taught his children how to "build the wall" and say "Make America Great Again" and by dressing one of his children in a tiny red "Make America Great Again" jumper. Asked if he could name an issue where he disagreed with Trump, DeSantis did not name a single issue. On July 30, 2018, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times wrote that the support DeSantis's primary campaign had received demonstrated both Trump's kingmaking capacity in a Republican-trending state but also a "broader nationalization of conservative politics" wherein "a willingness to hurl rhetorical lightning bolts at the left, the media and special counsel Robert S. Mueller can override local credentials, local endorsements and preparedness for a state-based job."On August 28, 2018, DeSantis won the Republican primary. His Democratic opponent in the general election is Andrew Gillum. The race is "widely seen as a toss-up."DeSantis’s gubernatorial platform includes support for legislation that would allow persons with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms openly. He also supports a law mandating the use of E-verify by businesses and a state-level ban on "sanctuary-city" protections for undocumented immigrants. DeSantis has promised to stop the spread of polluted water from Lake Okeechobee. DeSantis has also expressed support for a state constitutional amendment to require a supermajority vote for any tax increases. He opposes allowing able-bodied, childless adults to receive Medicaid. DeSantis has stated that he would implement a medical marijuana program, but opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana.On August 29, 2018, DeSantis came under fire for comments that were allegedly racially charged. DeSantis said: "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state. That is not going to work. That's not going to be good for Florida." DeSantis was accused of using the verb monkey as a racist dog whistle; his opponent, Gillum, is African-American. Amid the controversy over DeSantis' comments, the Washington Post and the Naples Daily News reported that DeSantis had on four occasions appeared at racially charged conferences at the David Horowitz Freedom Center that featured various right-wing provocateurs as speakers. DeSantis has stated that his comment had "'zero to do with race.'"In September 2018, DeSantis announced state Rep. Jeanette Nunez as his running mate. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on September 10, 2018, to focus on his gubernatorial candidacy. That same month, DeSantis was criticized for not having a fully-formed policy platform for his gubernatorial campaign. He cancelled a planned interview with the Tampa Bay Times to have additional time to put together a platform before an in-depth policy interview.

He co-sponsored a bill to impeach Koskinen for violating the public's trust. In 2015, DeSantis was named "Taxpayer Superhero" by Citizens Against Government Waste, a conservative think-tank.DeSantis supported the Regulations from the Executive in Need of Scrutiny (REINS) Act, which would require that regulations that have a significant economic impact be subject to a vote of Congress prior to taking effect.DeSantis introduced the Let Seniors Work Act, which would repeal the Retirement Earnings Test and exempt senior citizens from the 12.4% Social Security payroll tax, and he co-sponsored a measure to eliminate taxes on Social Security benefits.DeSantis sponsored the Transportation Empowerment Act, which would transfer much of the responsibility for transportation projects to the individual states and sharply reduce the federal gas tax.DeSantis has opposed legislation to require online retailers to collect and pay state sales tax.He voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017.

==== Iran ====
DeSantis opposed the Iran nuclear deal framework, calling it "a bad deal that will significantly degrade our national security." DeSantis said "the Iran deal gives Ayatollah Khamenei exactly what he wants: billions of dollars in sanctions relief, validation of the Iranian nuclear program, and the ability to stymie inspections."During a line of questioning, DeSantis told Secretary of State John Kerry that the executive branch had a legal obligation to provide Congress with the details behind any side deals made between world leaders and Iran. DeSantis accused President Barack Obama of giving better treatment of Cuba's Raul Castro and Iran's Ayatollah Ali Khamenei than of Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu.

Mueller can override local credentials, local endorsements and preparedness for a state-based job."On August 28, 2018, DeSantis won the Republican primary. His Democratic opponent in the general election is Andrew Gillum. The race is "widely seen as a toss-up."DeSantis’s gubernatorial platform includes support for legislation that would allow persons with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms openly. He also supports a law mandating the use of E-verify by businesses and a state-level ban on "sanctuary-city" protections for undocumented immigrants. DeSantis has promised to stop the spread of polluted water from Lake Okeechobee.

DeSantis has stated that he would implement a medical marijuana program, but opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana.On August 29, 2018, DeSantis came under fire for comments that were allegedly racially charged. DeSantis said: "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state. That is not going to work. That's not going to be good for Florida." DeSantis was accused of using the verb monkey as a racist dog whistle; his opponent, Gillum, is African-American. Amid the controversy over DeSantis' comments, the Washington Post and the Naples Daily News reported that DeSantis had on four occasions appeared at racially charged conferences at the David Horowitz Freedom Center that featured various right-wing provocateurs as speakers. DeSantis has stated that his comment had "'zero to do with race.'"In September 2018, DeSantis announced state Rep. Jeanette Nunez as his running mate. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on September 10, 2018, to focus on his gubernatorial candidacy. That same month, DeSantis was criticized for not having a fully-formed policy platform for his gubernatorial campaign. He cancelled a planned interview with the Tampa Bay Times to have additional time to put together a platform before an in-depth policy interview.

In addition, this provision would prohibit Mueller from investigating matters that occurred before June 2015, when Trump launched his presidential campaign. In December 2017, DeSantis asserted that if there was any evidence of collusion between members of the Trump campaign and Russian officials, it would already have been leaked.In January 2018, while on the House Intelligence Committee, DeSantis voted on party lines to release a classified memo authored by Republicans on the committee which purported to show that the FBI abused its surveillance powers in the Russia investigation.

In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that "President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda. ... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why."In 2013, DeSantis signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.On August 24, 2017, DeSantis added a rider to the proposed fiscal 2018 spending bill package that would end funding for the 2017 Special Counsel investigation "or for the investigation under that order of matters occurring before June 2015" (the month Trump announced he was running for president) 180 days after passage of the bill.The amendment would counter a bipartisan bill authored by two Democratic and two Republican U.S. Senators that was meant to limit the president's power to fire the special counsel. The DeSantis amendment would potentially cut off funding for the investigation by November 2017.

=== Legislation ===
On January 29, 2014, DeSantis introduced into the House the Faithful Execution of the Law Act of 2014 (H.R. 3973; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Justice to report to the United States Congress whenever any federal agency refrains from enforcing laws or regulations for any reason. In the report, the government would have to explain why it had decided not to enforce that law.DeSantis spoke in favor of the bill, arguing that "President Obama has not only failed to uphold several of our nation's laws, he has vowed to continue to do so in order to enact his unpopular agenda. ... The American people deserve to know exactly which laws the Obama administration is refusing to enforce and why."In 2013, DeSantis signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any global warming legislation that would raise taxes.On August 24, 2017, DeSantis added a rider to the proposed fiscal 2018 spending bill package that would end funding for the 2017 Special Counsel investigation "or for the investigation under that order of matters occurring before June 2015" (the month Trump announced he was running for president) 180 days after passage of the bill.The amendment would counter a bipartisan bill authored by two Democratic and two Republican U.S. Senators that was meant to limit the president's power to fire the special counsel. The DeSantis amendment would potentially cut off funding for the investigation by November 2017. It was also a response to Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein's statement that the DOJ, "doesn't conduct fishing expeditions." DeSantis stated that the May 17, 2017 DOJ order "didn't identify a crime to be investigated and practically invites a fishing expedition."He is a founding member of the Freedom Caucus, a group of congressional conservatives.


== 2016 U.S. Senate candidacy ==

On May 6, 2015, DeSantis announced that he was running for the United States Senate seat held by Marco Rubio, who initially did not file to run for re-election due to his bid for the U.S. presidency. He was endorsed by the fiscally conservative Club for Growth.DeSantis withdrew from the race following incumbent Senator Marco Rubio's announcement that he would seek reelection to the Senate, reversing his initial pledge not to run, on June 22, 2016.

== 2018 gubernatorial candidacy ==

In January 2018, DeSantis announced his candidacy for Governor of Florida to succeed term-limited Republican incumbent Rick Scott. President Donald Trump stated in December 2017 that he would support DeSantis should he run for Governor. During the Republican primary, DeSantis emphasized his support for Trump by running an ad where DeSantis taught his children how to "build the wall" and say "Make America Great Again" and by dressing one of his children in a tiny red "Make America Great Again" jumper. Asked if he could name an issue where he disagreed with Trump, DeSantis did not name a single issue. On July 30, 2018, Jonathan Martin of The New York Times wrote that the support DeSantis's primary campaign had received demonstrated both Trump's kingmaking capacity in a Republican-trending state but also a "broader nationalization of conservative politics" wherein "a willingness to hurl rhetorical lightning bolts at the left, the media and special counsel Robert S. Mueller can override local credentials, local endorsements and preparedness for a state-based job."On August 28, 2018, DeSantis won the Republican primary. His Democratic opponent in the general election is Andrew Gillum. The race is "widely seen as a toss-up."DeSantis’s gubernatorial platform includes support for legislation that would allow persons with concealed weapons permits to carry firearms openly.

DeSantis has stated that he would implement a medical marijuana program, but opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana.On August 29, 2018, DeSantis came under fire for comments that were allegedly racially charged. DeSantis said: "The last thing we need to do is to monkey this up by trying to embrace a socialist agenda with huge tax increases and bankrupting the state. That is not going to work. That's not going to be good for Florida." DeSantis was accused of using the verb monkey as a racist dog whistle; his opponent, Gillum, is African-American. Amid the controversy over DeSantis' comments, the Washington Post and the Naples Daily News reported that DeSantis had on four occasions appeared at racially charged conferences at the David Horowitz Freedom Center that featured various right-wing provocateurs as speakers. DeSantis has stated that his comment had "'zero to do with race.'"In September 2018, DeSantis announced state Rep. Jeanette Nunez as his running mate. He resigned his seat in the U.S. House of Representatives on September 10, 2018, to focus on his gubernatorial candidacy. That same month, DeSantis was criticized for not having a fully-formed policy platform for his gubernatorial campaign.
