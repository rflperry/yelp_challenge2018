The HPA amends the Internal Revenue Code and Title 18 of the United States Code to eliminate the transfer tax and paperwork associated with registration of suppressors, refund the tax to anyone who paid it after October 22, 2015 (the date the first Hearing Protection Act was introduced, by Rep. Matt Salmon), and "preempt" existing state or local silencer taxes and regulations.

In the Republican primary, businessman Richard Cash ranked first with 25% but failed to reach the 50% threshold to win outright. Duncan ranked second in the six candidate field with 23%.

Duncan spent $935,503; Democrat Jane Ballard Dyer spent $272,698.


==== 2012 ====

=== Legislation & Tenure ===
Duncan was a "Tea Party freshman" in the 112th Congress.In February, 2011, Duncan introduced a resolution to create a new committee on the elimination of nonessential federal programs in an attempt to reduce federal outlays.On January 18, 2012, Congressman Duncan introduced the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 (H.R. 3783). This bill made it U.S. policy to use a comprehensive strategy to counter Iran's growing hostile presence in the Western Hemisphere by working together with U.S. allies and partners in the region to deter threats to U.S. interest by Iran, the Iranian Islamic Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC's Qods Force, and Hezbollah. On December 28, 2012, President Barack Obama signed this into law.
On November 19, 2012 Duncan wrote a letter to President Obama discouraging him from nominating Ambassador Susan Rice to serve as Secretary of State. Duncan's letter, which was signed by 97 Members of Congress, states that Ambassador Rice "either willfully or incompetently misled the American public in the Benghazi matter." The letter goes on to say that Ambassador Rice has lost the trust of the American people and would greatly undermine the US credibility abroad.
On April 18, 2013, Duncan introduced the Outer Continental Shelf Transboundary Hydrocarbon Agreements Authorization Act (H.R. 1613). This bill approved a year-old agreement between the United States and Mexico to allow the joint development of oil and gas straddling the two countries' maritime boundary in the Gulf of Mexico. H.R. 1613 passed the House with bipartisan support on June 27, 2013.  The bill was subsequently wrapped into the Continuing Resolution of December 12, 2013.
On January 16, 2014 Duncan introduced the Energy Exploration and Production to Achieve National Demand Act (EXPAND Act) (H.R. 3895).  The EXPAND Act renews America's founding principles by freeing Americans to produce more energy in the United States from all sources and contribute to the strength of American national security through North American energy independence.
On March 13, 2014, Duncan introduced the DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act (H.R. 4228; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the accountability, transparency, and efficiency of its major acquisition programs. The bill would specify procedures for the department to follow if it fails to meet timelines, cost estimates, or other performance parameters for these programs. Duncan argued that "for years, DHS's purchases of major homeland security systems have been late, cost more, and done less than promised. This bill will save taxpayer dollars by forcing DHS to improve its management."On February 23, 2016 Duncan introduced H.Res. 617, which provides the House the authority to file a lawsuit against the Obama Administration should they violate or attempt to violate the law regarding the transfer of detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
In January 2017 Duncan introduced in the House the Hearing Protection Act of 2017 (HPA) which would reclassify gun suppressors (silencers) from Title II weapons to Title I weapons (currently ordinary shotguns, rifles and handguns, weapons "not regulated by the National Firearms Act, but regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968 and other federal laws"), restricting their regulation and making them easier to buy. The HPA amends the Internal Revenue Code and Title 18 of the United States Code to eliminate the transfer tax and paperwork associated with registration of suppressors, refund the tax to anyone who paid it after October 22, 2015 (the date the first Hearing Protection Act was introduced, by Rep.

=== Legislation & Tenure ===
Duncan was a "Tea Party freshman" in the 112th Congress.In February, 2011, Duncan introduced a resolution to create a new committee on the elimination of nonessential federal programs in an attempt to reduce federal outlays.On January 18, 2012, Congressman Duncan introduced the Countering Iran in the Western Hemisphere Act of 2012 (H.R. 3783). This bill made it U.S. policy to use a comprehensive strategy to counter Iran's growing hostile presence in the Western Hemisphere by working together with U.S. allies and partners in the region to deter threats to U.S. interest by Iran, the Iranian Islamic Guard Corps (IRGC), the IRGC's Qods Force, and Hezbollah. On December 28, 2012, President Barack Obama signed this into law.
On November 19, 2012 Duncan wrote a letter to President Obama discouraging him from nominating Ambassador Susan Rice to serve as Secretary of State. Duncan's letter, which was signed by 97 Members of Congress, states that Ambassador Rice "either willfully or incompetently misled the American public in the Benghazi matter." The letter goes on to say that Ambassador Rice has lost the trust of the American people and would greatly undermine the US credibility abroad.
On April 18, 2013, Duncan introduced the Outer Continental Shelf Transboundary Hydrocarbon Agreements Authorization Act (H.R. 1613). This bill approved a year-old agreement between the United States and Mexico to allow the joint development of oil and gas straddling the two countries' maritime boundary in the Gulf of Mexico. H.R. 1613 passed the House with bipartisan support on June 27, 2013.  The bill was subsequently wrapped into the Continuing Resolution of December 12, 2013.
On January 16, 2014 Duncan introduced the Energy Exploration and Production to Achieve National Demand Act (EXPAND Act) (H.R. 3895).  The EXPAND Act renews America's founding principles by freeing Americans to produce more energy in the United States from all sources and contribute to the strength of American national security through North American energy independence.
On March 13, 2014, Duncan introduced the DHS Acquisition Accountability and Efficiency Act (H.R. 4228; 113th Congress), a bill that would direct the United States Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to improve the accountability, transparency, and efficiency of its major acquisition programs. The bill would specify procedures for the department to follow if it fails to meet timelines, cost estimates, or other performance parameters for these programs. Duncan argued that "for years, DHS's purchases of major homeland security systems have been late, cost more, and done less than promised. This bill will save taxpayer dollars by forcing DHS to improve its management."On February 23, 2016 Duncan introduced H.Res. 617, which provides the House the authority to file a lawsuit against the Obama Administration should they violate or attempt to violate the law regarding the transfer of detainees from the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay.
In January 2017 Duncan introduced in the House the Hearing Protection Act of 2017 (HPA) which would reclassify gun suppressors (silencers) from Title II weapons to Title I weapons (currently ordinary shotguns, rifles and handguns, weapons "not regulated by the National Firearms Act, but regulated by the Gun Control Act of 1968 and other federal laws"), restricting their regulation and making them easier to buy. The HPA amends the Internal Revenue Code and Title 18 of the United States Code to eliminate the transfer tax and paperwork associated with registration of suppressors, refund the tax to anyone who paid it after October 22, 2015 (the date the first Hearing Protection Act was introduced, by Rep. Matt Salmon), and "preempt" existing state or local silencer taxes and regulations. In June 2017 Duncan added the HPA to the wide-ranging Sportsmen Heritage and Recreational Enhancement (SHARE) Act, of which he was also the lead sponsor. As of  30 January 2018, Jeff Duncan has the most conservative GovTrack ideology score in the House of Representatives.On January 19, 2018, Duncan introduced the Ultrasound Informed Consent Act (H.R. 4844) which requires that women seeking an abortion undergo an ultrasound before having an abortion.
