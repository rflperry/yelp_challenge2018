A month later, Zeldin signed on as a co-sponsor of the First Amendment Defense Act, a bill whose supporters said was designed to protect Americans who used their religious beliefs to deny services to same sex couples or unmarried pregnant women.

Zeldin also called for an investigation into the FBI decision to conclude its investigation into the Hillary Clinton email controversy.


=== Veterans affairs ===

A month later, Zeldin signed on as a co-sponsor of the First Amendment Defense Act, a bill whose supporters said was designed to protect Americans who used their religious beliefs to deny services to same sex couples or unmarried pregnant women.
