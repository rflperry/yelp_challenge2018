Subcommittee on Communications and Technology
Committee on Veterans' Affairs (Vice Chair)
Subcommittee on Economic Opportunity
Subcommittee on Health

=== Platform ===
Bilirakis has led efforts to enhance the United States' visa screening capabilities and has played a key role in efforts to strengthen America’s borders; most notably passing legislation to enhance the collection of biometric information from migrants captured at sea who are seeking illegal entry to the United States. He successfully placed legislative initiatives in the 9/11 recommendations bill that was signed into law to increase America's rail and public transportation security.
Bilirakis is also a leading sponsor of legislation to create a nationwide Silver Alert program. He is a signer of the Taxpayer Protection PledgeIn 2010 Bilirakis signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity promising to vote against any Global Warming legislation that would raise taxes.On September 29, 2008, Bilirakis voted against the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008.


=== Legislation ===
On April 10, 2014, Bilirakis introduced the Travel Promotion, Enhancement, and Modernization Act of 2014 Act (H.R. 4450; 113th Congress), a bill that would extend the provisions of the Travel Promotion Act of 2009 (Pub.L. 111–145), which established the Corporation for Travel Promotion (also known as Brand USA), through September 30, 2020, and impose new performance and procurement requirements on the corporation.


=== Movies ===
In 2014, Bilirakis had a cameo as a job applicant in the feature film Walt Before Mickey starring Thomas Ian Nicholas, Jon Heder, and Armando Gutierrez.


== Controversies ==
On February 11, 2017, Biliarkis hosted a townhall in Pasco County, Florida where he was faced with several protesters angry over the potential repeal of the Affordable Healthcare Act, when the chairman of the GOP in the county, Bill Akins repeated the now debunked claim that the ACA contains "what is effectively known as death panels." Biliarkis nodded in agreement and later told CNN that "The board exists, OK? And I've voted to repeal the board." Congressman Biliarkis seemed to equate the death panel with  the Independent Advisory Board, a 15-member committee that issues recommendations for reducing healthcare costs, subject to congressional oversight and approval.In early October 2018, Bilirakis released a campaign advertisement touting his work fighting opioids in Pasco County, Floriday.  In the advertisement, Bilirakis took credit for a law he did not have a hand in crafting. The 30-second ad flashed text about a "Bilirakis INTERDICT ACT" as Pasco County Sheriff Chris Nocco said Bilirakis is "giving us the tools to do our job and get traffickers off the street." The INTERDICT Act provides funding and equipment to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for detecting imported fentanyl. But Bilirakis was neither a sponsor nor one of 18 co-sponsors, making it unclear how it is the "Bilirakis INTERDICT Act."

He supported H. R. 38, which would enable concealed carry reciprocity among all States if and when it is signed into law.
In March 2017, Bilirakis voted in favor of the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which, if signed into law, will allow veterans who are considered "mentally incompetent" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge.
Following the 2017 Las Vegas shooting, Bilirakis signed a letter written to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives urging them to reevaluate the legal status of bump stocks, though no action has been taken as of March 2018.In the wake of the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in 2018, Bilirakis said that he would be willing to consider gun reform legislation, "if that's what it takes."
Bilirakis said that, specifically, he would support more school resource officers in schools.

Biliarkis nodded in agreement and later told CNN that "The board exists, OK? And I've voted to repeal the board." Congressman Biliarkis seemed to equate the death panel with  the Independent Advisory Board, a 15-member committee that issues recommendations for reducing healthcare costs, subject to congressional oversight and approval.In early October 2018, Bilirakis released a campaign advertisement touting his work fighting opioids in Pasco County, Floriday.  In the advertisement, Bilirakis took credit for a law he did not have a hand in crafting.

The INTERDICT Act provides funding and equipment to U.S. Customs and Border Protection for detecting imported fentanyl.
