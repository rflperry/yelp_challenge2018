After high school, she enrolled at Northern State University. She married Byron Noem at age 20.At age 22, Noem left college to help run her family's ranch after her father was killed in a farm machinery accident. Noem said that upon her father's death, she and her family members decided to take out a loan to pay taxes owing on the estate, noting that "for 10 years that loan really impacted our ability to make a profit".  Over the years, Noem added a hunting lodge and restaurant to the property, and all of her siblings have moved back to assist in expanding the businesses.After her father's accident, Noem stopped attending college full-time but, over the  years, took classes at the Watertown campus of Mount Marty College, and South Dakota State University.  After being elected to Congress, she continued her education, taking online courses and receiving credits for her work as a representative – leading the Washington Post to dub her Capitol Hill's "Most Powerful Intern." She earned a B.A. from the Department of Political Science at South Dakota State University in December 2011.

She publicly accused a state senator of a conflict of interest during a legislative hearing thus killing his effort to stop the construction of an Indian casino. In 2009 and 2010 she sponsored bills to lower the age of compulsory education in South Dakota to 16, after it had been raised to 18 in 2008, arguing that requiring school attendance until age 18 has not been proven to improve graduation rates. Supporters of the higher age argue that it increases graduation rates and provides motivation for students who would otherwise drop out.

2010
On June 8, 2010, Noem ran for South Dakota's at-large seat in the U.S. House of Representatives. She won the Republican primary with a plurality of 42% of the vote against South Dakota Secretary of State Chris Nelson and State Representative Blake Curd. According to Sabato's Crystal Ball blog, Noem's "victory over two A-list opponents" was impressive. Her primary opponents endorsed her in the general election.Noem's opponent, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congresswoman Stephanie Herseth Sandlin, emphasized her own record of independence from the Democratic caucus including her no votes on health care reform, the Wall Street bailouts, and the cap-and-trade energy bill. In response, Noem repeatedly highlighted Herseth Sandlin's vote for Nancy Pelosi as Speaker of the House. A Washington Post story on the race described Noem as "a made-for-Fox News star" and described her as a "mama grizzly" in the mold of former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin. During the 2010 election cycle, Noem out-raised Herseth Sandlin $2.3 million to $2.1 million. Of those totals, Noem received 84 percent of her cash from individual contributors while Herseth Sandlin received 56% from political action committees.  Mitt Romney's PAC made a donation to Noem's campaign, and Romney endorsed her.Gallup polls in June 2010 showed Republican candidates ahead of their Democratic counterparts due to dissatisfaction with President Barack Obama. Polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports consistently gave a Noem a slight edge over Herseth Sandlin following the June GOP primary, with Noem pulling ahead 47 percent to 44 percent in early October. Critics said the Rasmussen firm's surveying methods were erratic and tended to favor Republican candidates. Noem defeated Herseth Sandlin 48%–46%.

New provisions that Noem wants to add to federal law include limits on medical malpractice lawsuits and allowing patients to buy health insurance plans from other states. She supports cuts to Medicaid funding proposed by Republican Budget Committee chairman Paul Ryan that would reduce benefits for South Dakota Medicaid recipients by 55 percent.
Spending and taxesNoem calls the budget deficit one of the most important issues facing Congress, and is a cosponsor of H.J.Res. 2, which would require that total spending for any fiscal year not exceed total receipts.

Noem helped the House pass the legislation on November 14, 2014.Noem opposes a bill introduced by South Dakota Senator Tim Johnson that would designate over 48,000 acres (190 km2) of the Buffalo Gap National Grassland as protected wilderness. Noem supports the current designation of the land as a national grassland. She points out that the land is already managed as roadless areas similar to wilderness. Noem argues that raising the land's designation from protected grassland to wilderness will further limit leaseholders access to the land and further imperil grazing rights.She supports off-shore oil drilling.

== Political stances ==


=== Immigrants and refugees ===
Noem supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order that suspended the U.S. refugee program for 120 days and banned all travel to the U.S. by nationals of seven Muslim-majority countries for 90 days. Noem said that she supported a temporary ban on accepting refugees from "terrorist-held" areas, but "did not address whether she supports other aspects of the order, which led to the detention of legal U.S. residents such as green-card holders and people with dual citizenship as they reentered the country" in the aftermath of the order's issuance.


=== Taxes ===
In 2017, Noem was part of the conference committee for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. She worked closely with Ivanka Trump to preserve the Child Care Credit and was influential in finalizing the home mortgage interest deduction, the Adoption tax Credit, continuing credit for charitable contributions, and retaining popular retirement savings options. Noem was a steady advocate for fully repealing the estate tax. While the final bill did not include a full repeal, it doubled exemption levels and maintained the stepped-up basis, which she says provides some relief for South Dakota farmers and ranchers.
In 2018, Kristi Noem, a member of the tax-writing Ways and Means Committee, was reported to have "pitched the idea to members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus" to attach her online sales tax bill to the government funding package at the time, as part of an omnibus. A court case under consideration in the South Dakota Supreme Court involved requiring "certain out-of-state retailers to collect its sales taxes." Noem considers that South Dakota businesses (and by extension businesses nationwide) "could be forced to comply with 1,000 different tax structures nationwide without the tools necessary to do so", adding that her legislation "provides a necessary fix."
