==== 2010 ====

On September 28, 2009, Hultgren announced his candidacy for the Republican nomination in Illinois's 14th congressional district and won the party's nomination in the February 2nd primary election. Hultgren defeated Democratic incumbent Bill Foster 51%–45%.


==== 2012 ====

During his first term, Hultgren represented a hybrid suburban-rural district that stretched from the outer western suburbs of Chicago through Dixon all the way to Cambridge on the other side of the state.
As a result of the decennial reapportionment following the 2010 Census, Illinois lost one seat in the US House of Representatives.  The new district map (now featuring only 18 districts, and drawn by the Democratic-controlled Illinois General Assembly), saw Hultgren's district lose its vast western portion, becoming a much more compact district centered around the outer western suburbs of Chicago.
The new 14th included areas previously represented in the 8th district, represented by fellow Republican Joe Walsh. The new map drew Walsh's home into the 14th while making the 8th significantly more Democratic, prompting Walsh to consider challenging Hultgren in the primary for the much friendlier 14th.  However, soon after Hultgren sought a second term in the 14th, Walsh decided to run in the 8th district. In the general election, Hultgren won re-election to a second term, beating Democratic candidate Dennis Anderson, with 59% of the vote.


==== 2014 ====

Hultgren ran for a third term and was opposed by Dennis Anderson for a second time. Hultgren again defeated Anderson, this time with 65% of the vote.


==== 2016 ====

Hultgren defeated Democrat Jim Walz in the November 2016 general election with 59% of the vote.


==== 2018 ====
In the March 20, 2018, primary, Lauren Underwood won the Democratic nomination with 57.35% of the vote. Others receiving votes were Matt Brolley, Jim Walz, Victor Swanson, John Hosta, George Weber, and Daniel Roldan-Johnson.

In 2011, Hultgren introduced the Family Educational Records Privacy Extension Act (H.R. 2910), which would have required "parental consent before educational agencies or institutions release the educational records of home-schooled students."


==== Environment ====
Hultgren opposes federal regulation of greenhouse gas emissions. He has described cap-and-trade as "an irresponsible policy". In February 2017, he voted to repeal the Stream Protection Rule, a regulation that required coal companies to restore streams and mined areas to their pre-development conditions. In February 2017, he voted in favor of repealing a rule that required energy companies to disclose payments to foreign governments.In 2010, Hultgren signed a pledge sponsored by Americans for Prosperity, promising to vote against any climate-change legislation that would raise taxes. The League of Conservation Voters gave Hultgren an environmental rating of 0% for 2017 and a lifetime rating of 5%.


==== Gun control ====
Hultgren is a strong supporter of the second amendment. In April 2018, after the Parkland, Florida, school shooting, Hultgren urged schools and police to do a better job of identifying and intervening with people who are potential threats. “We need to do more to make sure people who are speaking out and acting out or have mental challenges don't get weapons, that people who have criminal histories don't get weapons, and when hearing of a threat we respond quickly,” Hultgren said.


==== Health care ====
Hultgren favors repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On May 4, 2017, Hultgren voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act and to pass the American Health Care Act.Hultgren supported a bill that would allow employers to exclude veterans receiving health insurance from the United States Department of Defense or the United States Department of Veterans' Affairs from their list of employees. This would have the effect of keeping their list of employees shorter, allowing some small businesses to fall underneath the 50 full-time employees line that would require them to provide their employees with healthcare under the requirements of the Affordable Care Act.


==== Identity fraud ====
Hultgren and three other Members of Congress sponsored the Protecting Children from Identity Theft Act, H.R. 5192, which would require the Social Security Administration (SSA) to take a more active role in preventing identity theft.

Hultgren endorsed businessman and Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.


=== Economic issues ===


==== National debt ====
In 2013, Hultgren voted for legislation stop an increase of the debt limit, which led to a government shutdown. Hultgren was the only congressperson from Illinois to vote against an agreement to reopen government and end the government shutdown.


==== Taxes ====
Hultgren has sponsored legislation to permanently repeal the estate tax and has voted several times to repeal the tax.In November 2017, Hultgren and Peter Roskam introduced the Bring Small Business back Tax Reform Act as part of the Trump Administration's tax reform package. The bill, said Hultgren, was intended “to cut the overall small business tax rate to 25 percent,” a change that he said would “provide much-needed relief to the engine of Illinois' economy.”


==== Tariffs ====
In June 2018, Hultgren and Peter Roskam expressed their disapproval of President's Trump plan to impose tariffs on Mexico, Canada, and the European Union. “There's real concern about what an escalating trade war would mean,” said Hultgren, who articulated concern about the impact of such tariffs on manufacturers and farmers in his district.


==== Budget ====
Hultgren supports a balanced budget amendment to the U.S. Constitution.Hultgren and Andy Barr (R-KY) introduced legislation that would compel the Government Accountability Office (GAO) to study the privacy risks associated with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau’s Home Mortgage Disclosure Act rule. The legislation would also prohibit depository institutions, the CFPB, and the Federal Financial Institutions Examination Council from making available to the public any information gathered in accordance with the Home Mortgage Disclosure Act.


==== Banking ====
On March 6, 2018, the House passed without opposition H.R. 4725, the Community Bank Reporting Relief Act, sponsored by Hultgren and two other Members of Congress. The law simplifies reporting requirements for community banks. “The role of smaller financial institutions is especially important in more rural areas, such as my district, where larger banks tend to not have as many branches” Hultgren stated.


==== Corporations ====
Hultgren is a vocal opponent of the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which created new financial regulations after the financial crisis. He has called Dodd-Frank "flawed" and introduced Republican-backed legislation to put an end Dodd-Frank. Hultgren supported the Financial CHOICE Act, another Republican-backed bill to dismantle Dodd-Frank; the legislation would eliminate the Treasury Department's Office of Financial Research, kill the Volcker Rule (which bars certain banks from particular risky trades); kill the Orderly Liquidation Authority (which allows the federal government to shut down failing banks that post a systemic risk to the economy); and remove a provision imposing greater oversight on "systemically important financial institutions." Hultgren introduced the Swaps Regulatory Improvement Act into the House in March 2013; the bill would roll back Dodd-Frank regulations and expand banks' authority to use swaps to hedging risk. The bill passed the House but not the Senate, and did not become law.Hultgren has been a strong advocate of municipal finance and tax-exempt municipal bonds. In 2013, he joined with fellow U.S. Representative Dutch Ruppersberger (D-MD) in securing the signatures of 137 House Republicans and Democrats in a letter to congressional leaders "reject any proposal to cap or eliminate the deduction on tax-exempt municipal bonds used to finance the vast majority of infrastructure projects in America’s communities." The two circulated a similar letter in 2015 and formed the Municipal Finance Caucus in 2016.


=== International issues ===


==== Immigration ====
"Immigration is a foundational part of who we are...to be a place of refuge," he told the Chicago Tribune in September 2017. "I understand that there are bad actors and terrorists out there ... but I don't want to shut off opportunity for people who really need refuge."In December 2015, citing religious freedom, he criticized presidential candidate Donald Trump's proposal to ban Muslims from entering the U.S. “Singling out any faith community for the actions of extremists is not conservative, it is hostile to our founding,” Hultgren said.


==== Human rights in China ====
In September 2017, Hultgren hosted a screening Chinese dissident artist Ai Weiwei's new film "Human Flow," which is about the refugee crisis in 23 countries. Hultgren, noted the Chicago Tribune, had “taken up the cause of Zhu Yufu, a Chinese dissident poet jailed for publishing pro-democracy poetry.”On February 14, 2018, Hultgren delivered a statement on the House floor wishing a happy birthday to Zhu Yufu, a prisoner of conscience in China, and calling on Chinese authorities to release him from detention. Hultgren had “adopted” Zhu Yufu to highlight his plight as part of the Defending Freedoms Project, a joint effort by the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, the U.S. Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF), and Amnesty International USA. The next day, the Lantos Commission, which Hultgren co-chairs, hosted a hearing on prisoners of conscience.


==== Russia ====
Hultgren supported H.R. 3364, the Countering America's Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which became law in August 2017. It authorized sanctions against Iran, North Korea, and Russia. Hultgren also welcomed the indictment in February 2018 of 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities. In March 2018, Hultgren expressed approval of Congressional sanctions on “Russian individuals and entities” who had engaged in “long-running, coordinated and malicious attempts to influence and disrupt our American elections and political system.” He also welcomed the Trump Administration's implementation of the sanctions. “These actions send a clear message that our electoral system is not to be tampered with, and the United States will respond when we or our allies are attacked.” he said.

According to NBC Chicago, "the conservative Republican has carved a reputation as a pro-science, pro-STEM education supporter."Hultgren went on record to note that "The U.S. research system is unique. We’ve found an incredibly powerful combination, wedding education and research by incorporating universities, user facilities and Department of Energy resources. But this system is only as stable our commitment to it, which is why sustained and predictable research funding is crucial."Along with then United States Senator Mark Udall (D-CO), Hultgren was awarded the George Brown Science Technology Engineering Leadership award by the Science, Technology, Engineering Working Group, a coalition of pro-science groups including The American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Institute of Physics, ASME, et al.In October 2012, Hultgren was a recipient of the Champion of Science Award by the Science Coalition, a non-profit advocacy group composed of the 50 leading research universities in the United States.
