=== Political issues ===


==== Government spending ====
In March 2018, O'Halleran criticized the Trump Administration for seeking to cut funding for such agencies and programs as the Economic Development Administration, the Rural Business and Cooperative Service, the Manufacturing Extension Partnership, Community Development Block Grants, Rural Water and Wastewater Grants, Indian Community Development Block Grant, the Rural Economic Development Program, Essential Air Service, and Native American Housing Block Grants.


==== Gun control ====
After the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Florida, O'Halleran, who had long supported expanded background checks but opposed an assault-weapon ban, suggested he might shift toward a stronger position on gun control. “At times you have to look at yourself in the mirror and do the right thing and say forget about the political consequences,” he said, but admitted he was concerned about those consequences.


==== Health care ====
In March 2017, O'Halleran denounced the Republican health-care replacement plan, saying that it would fail “to provide affordable access to health coverage,” would disproportionately affect rural communities, force seniors to pay higher premiums, and give CEOs "a tax break on the backs of hardworking Arizona families."


==== Immigration ====
When President Donald Trump ordered a travel ban on visitors and refugees from seven predominantly Muslim nations in January 2017, O'Halleran said that the order “does not represent our nation's values” and that it violated the Constitution and "the bedrock ideals of our democracy."In April 2017, O'Halleran criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions's tougher new guidelines on expelling illegal immigrants who belong to criminal gangs. “I have no problem with getting the felons out of the country,” O'Halleran said. "But some of these people that they're taking out of the country, they have children that are Americans, and they have not had a violent felony conviction. Here we are, taking mothers away from their children."O'Halleran was part of a group of Arizona Democrats who, in an August 2017 letter to President Trump, urged him not to pardon former Maricopa County chief Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who had been convicted in a federal court of racially profiling Latinos as part of border patrols. "It is imperative for a society to hold elected leaders to the highest level of accountability, and when they are convicted of crimes and lose the trust of the public, they must face their punishment,” said O'Halleran. “As a former law enforcement officer, Joe Arpaio's abuse and exploitation of his power to target vulnerable communities is beyond egregious and tarnishes the sworn duty of our brave officers across Arizona."


== Personal life ==
O'Halleran and his wife, Pat, live in unincorporated Yavapai County (with a Sedona address), and have three grown children and four grandchildren.
