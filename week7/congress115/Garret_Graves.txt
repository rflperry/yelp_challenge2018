Graves, who has been mentioned as a potential challenger to Edwards in the 2019 gubernatorial election, claims that he is "focused on flood recovery ... none of the governor's talk is helping flood victims."Edwards attributed the delay in disbursement of the funds, which began on April 10, to the state's financial shortfall which prevented the quick retaining of a disaster management firm.
