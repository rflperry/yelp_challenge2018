=== Pharmaceuticals ===
In October 2017, The Washington Post and 60 Minutes reported that Marino was the chief advocate of a 2016 bill that hobbled the ability of the Drug Enforcement Administration to combat the opioid epidemic. Marino introduced the bill, the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective Drug Enforcement Act, in 2014 and again in 2015; it failed both times. The 2014 version was opposed by the DEA and the Justice Department, but the 2015 version was sold as an attempt to "work with the pharmaceutical companies" and was subject to heavy lobbying. A similar version introduced in the Senate by Orrin Hatch passed both houses of Congress by unanimous consent and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on April 19, 2016. The legislation aimed to weaken the DEA's authority to take enforcement action against drug distributors who supplied unscrupulous physician and pharmacists with opioids for diversion to the black market. Previously, the DEA had fined individuals who profited on suspicious sales of painkillers and repeatedly ignored warnings that the painkillers were sold illegally. The new legislation would have made it "virtually impossible" for the DEA to stop these sales, according to internal agency documents, Justice Department documents, and the DEA’s chief administrative law judge. Marino, whose district was heavily affected by the opioid epidemic, declined to comment on the reports.The drug industry spent at least $106 million lobbying Congress on the legislation between 2014 and 2016. McKesson Corporation, AmerisourceBergen, and Cardinal Health spent $13 million lobbying in support of the bill. When Joseph Rannazzisi, the chief of the Drug Enforcement Administration's Office of Diversion Control, strongly criticized the bill, Marino and his cosponsor Marsha Blackburn demanded that the drug diversion enforcer be investigated by the United States Department of Justice Office of the Inspector General. Nothing came of the investigation but Rannazzisi was removed from his position in August and retired in October 2015.


== Office of National Drug Control Policy ==
In September 2017, President Donald Trump nominated Marino to serve as the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy ("drug czar").  In October, Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) called on Trump to withdraw Marino's nomination. Trump said he would "look into" reports about Marino, putting his nomination in question. On October 17, 2017, Marino withdrew his nomination.
