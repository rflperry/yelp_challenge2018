== Career ==


=== Investment management ===
After college, Poliquin worked in the investment management industry in Chicago and New York City. At Avatar Investors Associates Corporation, a fund management company, Poliquin helped manage nearly $5 billion in worker pension funds.


=== Gubernatorial campaign ===

In 2010, Poliquin sought the Maine Republican Party's nomination for Governor of Maine. He spent $711,000 of his own money on the campaign, finishing sixth of the seven candidates behind winner Paul LePage.  Poliquin ultimately endorsed LePage. Following LePage's election in November 2010, Poliquin was elected by the Maine Legislature to serve as Maine State Treasurer.


=== State Treasurer ===
In 2011, Poliquin expressed concerns about the Maine State Housing Authority's plans to construct a low-income housing complex in Portland. Poliquin cited the proposed $314,000 per unit cost as an example of irresponsible government spending. Dale McCormick, the authority's director and an appointee by Democratic Governor John Baldacci, approved the proposal following a reduction in the per unit price to $265,000.In 2012, Maine Democrats accused Poliquin of violating the state Constitution by allegedly engaging in commerce while in office. The complaints against Poliquin centered around his involvement with the Popham Beach Club, a private club in Phippsburg, Maine, and Dirigo Holdings LLC, a real estate company. Maine Attorney General William Schneider advised Poliquin to disassociate himself from his business ventures but did not offer an opinion as to whether he had actually violated the Constitution.  The Maine House voted unanimously to send the issue to the Maine Supreme Judicial Court in order to settle the matter. The Court declined to offer a ruling, concluding that there were no circumstances in Poliquin's case requiring immediate attention.In February 2012, Poliquin faced criticism from Democrats over his use of the Maine Tree Growth Tax Program, a program meant to preserve forestland from development pressures for commercial timber harvesting, with 10 acres of his oceanfront property in Georgetown. The program reduced the value of his property from the originally assessed $1.8 million to $725,500, resulting in Poliquin paying $30 a year in property taxes. A Maine Forest Service report in 2009 discussed Poliquin's property as an example of a property that may not be fully complying with the law, stating that restrictions on timber harvesting in shoreland areas would limit any commercial use of the land. They did state, however, that as long as the property was 10 acres, it could remain in the program. Poliquin later transferred the property in question to the Open Space program, a less generous tax abatement program. Poliquin stated that the issue was a distraction for the town and was politically motivated due to Democrats' dissatisfaction with his policies as Treasurer.At the end of his term, Poliquin wrote an op-ed in the Bangor Daily News with a list of his offices' accomplishments as Treasurer. These included reforms to the state workers' pension plan, efforts to reduce the cost of affordable housing, reduced wasteful spending, and retention of the state's Aa2 bond rating, among other initiatives.

Poliquin stated on July 10, 2013, that he was not interested in becoming the Chairman of the Maine Republican Party, despite encouragement to do so from many Republicans, including Governor Paul LePage.

=== Political issues ===


==== Taxation ====
In November 2017, Poliquin said he would vote for the new Republican tax bill, whose framers had dismissed "a late suggestion by President Donald Trump to lower the top rate on high-wage earners." Poliquin, in the paraphrase of the Washington Times, said that the proposal "would help Maine residents by doubling the standard deduction and increasing tax credits for children...while keeping taxes low for small businesses and making large businesses more competitive by bringing the corporate rate into line with other industrialized countries." "We want to eliminate as many of these loopholes and special-interest carve-outs that only the wealthy and well-connected are able to take advantage of," he said, describing the work on the bill as "very methodical, very transparent and very thoughtful." Noting that he had voted earlier in November "to move the tax proposal forward in the House, trusting the Senate would continue to work on it and improve it," he expressed approval of the changes made by Senator Susan Collins and others "that will benefit Maine families and small businesses, such as retaining the medical expense deduction and improving the provision dealing with historic tax credits."


==== Tariffs ====
In December 2017, the International Trade Commission ruled 4-0 to activate tariffs on Chinese hardwood plywood, thus leveling the playing field for U.S. wood products, a decision Poliquin had urged upon them at an October hearing. The Democratic Leader of the Maine State Senate, Troy Jackson (D-Allagash), praised Poliquin "for his successful efforts to fight against illegal and unfair foreign trade," and Garry Gillespie of Columbia Forest Products said: "On behalf of the 161 Columbia Forest Products employees in Presque Isle, Maine, we are both thrilled and thankful with the results at the ITC."


==== Buying American ====
In March 2016, Poliquin testified before the House Armed Services Committee in support of the use by the U.S. military of American-made products. In April 2016, Poliquin's Stepping Up for American Workers and Troops Act required that the Department of Defense adhere to the 1941 Berry Amendment, which requires it to give preference to American-made products. In the Maine Wire, Poliquin was praised for having thereby saved 900 Maine jobs.


==== Healthcare ====
On February 3, 2015, Poliquin was one of three House Republicans to vote against repealing the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare. His spokesman stated that while Poliquin supports repeal, the proposed bill did not offer a "free market alternative" to immediately take its place, which he feels is needed. Poliquin was subsequently criticized by conservative groups seeking immediate repeal of the law, including the Republican Liberty Caucus which voted on February 5, 2015, to rescind their election endorsement of him. Poliquin responded by noting the House has voted numerous times to repeal the law without effect, and that "Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result."In his 2016 re-election campaign, Poliquin ran on a policy of repealing the Affordable Care Act. On May 4, 2017, he voted to pass the American Health Care Act, which would have effectively repealed the ACA and included cuts to Medicaid. He stated it included the best parts of previous attempts to repeal the ACA. He has received criticism for taking money from insurance companies and avoiding discussions regarding his vote to repeal. For his 2018 re-election campaign, the health care section on Poliquin's campaign website no longer made explicit mention of the Affordable Care Act.In 2018, he co-sponsored legislation that would have cut $7 billion from federal aid towards children's health insurance.


==== Veterans affairs ====
In October 2017, Poliquin announced plans for the Veterans Access to Long Term Care and Health Services Act, which would "reduce red tape" for nursing homes treating veterans.In November 2017, Poliquin questioned officials of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) at a Veterans Affairs Committee hearing. The hearing followed a report by the Government Accountability Office detailing the VA's "failure to report potentially dangerous medical practitioners to their national database, which is intended to prevent such bad actors from crossing state lines and putting patients at risk elsewhere." Poliquin later introduced legislation requiring VA medical professionals to report malpractice at the VA to state licensing boards.


==== Immigration ====
In March 2018, Poliquin criticized his Democratic challengers, writing that "illegal immigration is still illegal. We are a country of immigrants, but we are also a Nation of Laws. People entering America must do so legally, otherwise they are not immigrants, they are illegals." He added: "This common-sense position is not shared by a single one of my four opponents....They are more concerned with appeasing the extreme far left and having the support of Nancy Pelosi."


==== LGBT issues ====
In May 2016, Poliquin voted against a measure intended to uphold an executive order that barred discrimination against LGBT employees by religious organizations that contract with the federal government. He was one of seven House Republicans to switch their vote at the last minute, under pressure from Republican House Leadership. After criticism from Democrats, he issued a statement saying "I am outraged that political opponents or members of the press would claim or insinuate that I cast a vote due to pressure or party politics. No one controls my vote" and that he abhorred discrimination in any form.


==== Terrorism ====
In 2016, Poliquin drafted a bill that would prohibit the federal government from giving food stamps to individuals convicted of terrorism-related crimes. Poliquin said the legislation would close a loophole that allows convicted terrorists to apply for aid.


==== Iran ====
In December 2017, the House passed Poliquin's Iranian Leadership Asset Transparency Act by a 289-135 vote. Poliquin's fourth bill to pass the House that year, it required the public disclosure of the assets of Iran's regime, which had supported terrorism. "Reports have indicated these funds are being used to support and sponsor terrorism around the region and to undermine our own national security interests. Iran, the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism, cannot be trusted and it's important for the security of the region and for the United States for these secret funds to be exposed publicly to the world."


== Personal life ==
On February 11, 1992, Poliquin's wife, Jane, drowned in a swimming accident at the Palmas Del Mar Beach Resort in Humacao, Puerto Rico.
