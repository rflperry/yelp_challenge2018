=== Positions ===


==== Abortion ====
Cramer opposes abortion. He is a critic of Planned Parenthood and has called for cutting off public funding of the group. In 2013, Cramer condemned the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade and tied an uptick in mass shootings to the legalization of abortion and a decline in religious values. This remark was criticized by the director of the North Dakota Democratic Party and in Cosmopolitan. Cramer said, "I was asked recently by a reporter if I am afraid that some people would attack me if I speak like this. And I said, 'No, I am not afraid they will, I am quite certain they will.'" In the same speech, Cramer said of U.S. society: "We have normalized perversion and perverted God's natural law."


==== Donald Trump ====
Cramer supported Trump's 2017 executive order banning entry to the U.S. by citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries, saying, "I think what Donald Trump is doing is he's pulling America's head out of the sand and facing the reality that we have not been kept very safe by current immigration and refugee policies." He has been described as one of Trump's allies in Congress and has pledged to be with Trump "100 percent of the time".In February 2017, during President Trump's first address to a joint session of Congress, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and a number of other female Democratic members of Congress wore white in protest against Trump. Cramer mocked the clothing protest, saying Pelosi dressed "poorly" and remarking, "It is a syndrome. There is no question, there is a disease associated with the notion that a bunch of women would wear bad-looking white pantsuits in solidarity with Hillary Clinton to celebrate her loss. You cannot get that weird."


==== Environment and energy ====
Cramer rejects the scientific consensus on climate change. He has said that he would support a small carbon tax if the revenue went to research and development on clean fuel. Cramer has been described by Reuters as "one of America's most ardent drilling advocates." Cramer supports an increase in oil and gas drilling on public lands and cutting taxes for energy producers. He is opposed to what he characterizes as overreach by the United States Environmental Protection Agency. In May 2016, Trump asked Cramer to draft his campaign's energy policy. Cramer wrote Trump's energy plan, which focuses heavily on promoting fossil fuels and weakening environmental regulation. The plan also vows to withdraw the U.S. from the Paris Agreement and repeal U.S. regulations aims at controlling the carbon emissions that cause climate change. Cramer was "one of a handful of early Trump endorsers" among U.S. House Republicans.


==== Food stamps ====
Cramer supports cuts in Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (formerly the Food Stamp Program), and attracted controversy in 2013 when he cited a biblical quotation several times in support of Republicans' efforts to cut $40 billion from the program over ten years.


==== Gun policy ====
Cramer said that gun control would not have prevented the Orlando nightclub shooting. In 2016, he criticized proposed gun control legislation, saying, "The problem isn't the U.S. Constitution. The problem is Islamic terrorism."


==== Health care ====
Cramer opposes the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and has voted to repeal it without a replacement five times. He has voted against health insurance protections for patients with pre-existing conditions and against the expansion of Medicaid. Cramer has said that the American Health Care Act of 2017, the Republican bill he supported to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, would have prevented "price discrimination" against people with preexisting conditions; The Washington Post fact-checker described this assertion as false.


==== Violence Against Women Act ====
In 2013, at a forum on the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), Cramer engaged in "a testy exchange with Native American victim assistance leaders." He later issued a statement apologizing for his "tone and rhetoric" during the exchange. Cramer voted to reauthorize VAWA, but opposed language in the act that would allow tribal courts to prosecute non-Natives "for abusing or assaulting Native American women on Indian land." Cramer asked, "How could a non-Native man get a fair trial on a reservation?" and questioned the constitutionality of the provision. He voted for an amendment to repeal it.


==== LGBT issues ====
During his 2018 campaign, Cramer sought and received the support of the Public Advocate of the United States, an anti-LGBT group that advocates conversion therapy and ties homosexuality to pedophilia. In an eight-question survey for the group, Cramer said he would oppose "'Transgender Bathrooms' legislation and regulations – which have the effect of encouraging and protecting pedophiles". Cramer also agreed that "public schools should be 'prevented from brainwashing elementary school children with the Homosexual Agenda.'" Cramer indicated support for requiring schools to teach that there are only two genders and granting Christian businesses the right to not service same-sex weddings. A spokesman for Cramer said: "Let's be clear. Congressman Cramer doesn't support the teaching of history with any special emphasis on any particular group. History is history and should be taught as such. Additionally, Kevin does not think transgender people are at all comparable to pedophiles – this a gross misinterpretation of the survey question."Cramer opposes same-sex marriage and condemned the Supreme Court of the United States' decision in Obergefell v. Hodges.


==== Supreme Court nomination of Brett Kavanaugh ====
In 2018, Cramer said that both Anita Hill's sexual harassment allegations against Clarence Thomas and Christine Blasey Ford's sexual assault allegations against Brett Kavanaugh were "absurd". He called Ford's allegation "even more absurd" than Hill's because the sexual assault that Ford described "never went anywhere" and because both Kavanaugh and Ford were intoxicated teenagers. Cramer questioned whether Ford's sexual assault allegations against Kavanaugh would disqualify him from the Supreme Court even if found to be true, adding that if Kavanaugh were found to have lied in denying the allegations, that would be disqualifying.


==== Taxes ====
Cramer voted to repeal the estate tax, which imposes a tax after the first several million dollars on the estate of a dead person. He supports Trump's 25% tax on many types of imports, which may have decreased sales for North Dakota's soybean industry in 2018, but has said he believes the long-term benefits of a trade war are worth it.


=== Elections ===

== 2018 U.S. Senate campaign ==

After months of speculation, Cramer announced on January 11, 2018, that he would not seek the Republican nomination for U.S. Senate to run against North Dakota Democratic-Nonpartisan League Party incumbent Heidi Heitkamp and would instead run for reelection to the U.S. House. Then on February 15, 2018, Cramer announced that he had changed his mind and would run for the U.S. Senate in 2018. Odney advertising firm president Pat Finken serves as Cramer's campaign manager. On April 7, Cramer secured the official endorsement of the North Dakota Republican Party. Three days later, his campaign announced it had raised $1.35 million in the first quarter of 2018, most of it in late February and March.In June 2018, The Washington Post reported that Cramer had contacted the White House to seek political help in his Senate campaign and was upset that President Donald Trump had not publicly criticized incumbent Democratic Senator Heidi Heitkamp in the same way that he had criticized other Democrats. Cramer later publicly criticized White House staff and argued that Trump was refraining from criticizing Heitkamp because she was a woman. Trump scheduled a June 2018 trip to North Dakota to campaign for Cramer, a trip that Politico reported "could go a long way toward extinguishing tensions between the White House and the Senate hopeful."Cramer secured the Republican nomination for the United States Senate on June 12, 2018.In July 2018, a spokesman for the political network organized by the Koch brothers announced that they would not financially support Cramer's campaign because the brothers viewed Cramer as insufficiently supportive of free trade and fiscal conservatism, and because Cramer held other views inconsistent with theirs.
