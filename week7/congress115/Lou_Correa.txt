Correa was re-elected to the Assembly twice but was forced from office by California's term limits law, which restricts members from serving more than three two-year terms.
In 2004, he campaigned for and was elected to the Orange County Board of Supervisors, becoming the first Democrat to serve on the board since 1987. He represented the First District, which includes the cities of Garden Grove, Santa Ana, and Westminster as well as unincorporated areas of the county including Midway City.
