William H. Long II (born August 11, 1955) is an American auctioneer and politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Missouri's 7th congressional district since 2011. The district includes much of the southwestern quadrant of the state and is anchored in Springfield. The district also includes Joplin and the popular tourist destination of Branson.
A member of the Republican Party, he was elected to fill the district's vacant seat in the 2010 midterm elections following the successful election of Roy Blunt to the U.S. Senate.


== Early life and education ==
Long is a fourth-generation native of Missouri. He was born in Springfield in 1955. He attended the University of Missouri and was a member of the Delta Upsilon fraternity prior to dropping out. After taking 3 years off from school, Long decided to attend a 9 day training with the Missouri Auction School in Kansas City. He received his Certified Auctioneer Institute designation via the National Auctioneers Association Education Institute and Trustees.

Long owned Billy Long Auctions, LLC. He was also a talk radio show host on the Springfield-based station KWTO. He is a member of the National Association of Realtors, National Auctioneers Association, the Springfield Area Chamber of Commerce, the National Rifle Association, and the Greater Springfield Board of Realtors.During a September 2018 House Committee on Energy and Commerce hearing on alleged anti-conservative bias on social media, far-right internet personality Laura Loomer interrupted the meeting. Long drowned out Loomer's heckling with his rapid-fire delivery skills, honed as an auctioneer, until she was escorted out. The incident generated considerable laughter from the audience.
Long also participated in the World Poker Tour participating in professional sanctioned games including the Southern Poker Championship at the Beau Rivage and the Bellagio Cup.
In September 2018, in response to sexual assault allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett M. Kavanaugh, Long retweeted a post comparing attempted rape to a "kiss on the forehead" on Twitter.

Allowing agencies to reevaluate the refugee resettlement program is a commonsense approach to making sure that happens.”
