=== Elections ===
In 1994, incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Anthony C. Beilenson of California's 24th congressional district barely survived the Republican Revolution, winning re-election by just a two-point margin, by far the worst election performance of his career. In 1996, Beilenson decided to retire.
Sherman decided to run and won the 7-candidate Democratic primary with 54% of the vote. In the general election, he defeated Republican nominee Rich Sybert (also 1994 nominee) 49%–44%. However, he has never faced another contest nearly that close.
In 1998, he won re-election with 57% of the vote. After that, he has won re-election every two years with at least 62%.
2012
Redistricting following the 2010 census drew the homes of Sherman and fellow Democrat Howard Berman, who had previously represented the 28th District, into the 30th District. The redrawn 30th was more Sherman's district than Berman's; Sherman retained approximately 60% of his former territory, while Berman retained 20% of his former voters. On June 5, 2012, Sherman faced Berman in the primary for California’s new 30th Congressional district. Sherman finished first, leading 42% to 32%. However, due to the new election system in California, which put the two candidates who received the most votes in the primary against each other regardless of party, the two congressmen again faced each other in the general election. Neither candidate received an official endorsement from the state Democratic Party.Berman was the establishment candidate. He was endorsed by over 20 congressmen, including party leaders Steny Hoyer and Xavier Becerra. In addition, he was endorsed by sitting Governor Jerry Brown, sitting Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, and the state's two U.S. Senators: Barbara Boxer and Dianne Feinstein.

In addition, he was endorsed by two Republican U.S. Senators: John McCain (R-AZ), Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and by Independent U.S. Senator Joe Lieberman.Sherman was endorsed by Lieutenant Governor Gavin Newsom, former President Bill Clinton, and former Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis.In the general election, Sherman defeated Berman, 60%–40%.

In December 2017, eight former aides to Sherman said that his offices in Washington, D.C. and California had a toxic environment characterized by frequent "verbal abuse from the congressman and senior staff that made them feel bullied and demoralized." A focus of the criticism was Matt Dababneh, Sherman's district director and a close advisor, who began working for Sherman in 2005, and became district director to Sherman in 2009. Dababneh was elected to the California State Assembly in 2013, and resigning from that body after allegations of sexual assault and other misconduct were made against him. Former employees in Sherman's office told the Los Angeles Times that Dababneh frequently made inappropriate sexual remarks, including degrading and sexist comments, and bragged about his sexual exploits. No one suggested that Sherman knew of Dababneh's conduct, but several staffers said that the office environment did not encourage reporting and said that Sherman would not have been receptive to complaints about a trusted advisor.Sherman has acknowledged being "a demanding boss" but "denied that his management style contributed to the silence about Dababneh's behavior." Surveys of Capitol Hill staff rated Sherman as one of the more difficult members to work for, with high staff turnover rates.In January 2018, Sherman held a town hall meeting in Reseda, where a questioner who supported a Democratic primary challenged to Sherman accused the congressman of having an inadequate sexual harassment policy. Sherman replied that "We have five different ways to report sexual harassment in my office. One among those is to talk to me personally. And I talk to each staff member several times a year about the office policy."
