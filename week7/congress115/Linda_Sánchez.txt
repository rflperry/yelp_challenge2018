39th Congressional District (2003 - 2012)
Sánchez started her political career after a new 39th congressional district was created following the 2000 Census (the old 39th district had very different boundaries). She finished first in a six-person primary for the Democratic Party nomination in March 2002. She won the primaries with 33.5% of the vote, with the second place candidate Hector de la Torre receiving 29.3%. She went on to win the general elections against Republican Tim Escobar by a 54.9% to 40.8% margin.
She ran unopposed in the Democratic primaries in 2004. She faced Escobar again in the general election, defeating him by a margin of 60.7% to 39.3%. For the 2006 elections, she defeated two challengers in the primary with 77.8% of the vote, and defeated attorney James L. Andion in the general election.
Linda and her sister, Loretta, became the first pair of sisters to serve together in the U.S. House of Representatives. Her sister, former Representative Loretta Sanchez, served as a congresswoman from 1996 until she announced her plan to run for U.S. Senate. She finished second in California's "top two" primary, and was defeated by fellow Democrat, state Attorney General Kamala Harris, in the general election in 2016.

Additional to these, she supported a 15 billion dollar bailout for GM and Chrysler as well as a 60 Billion dollar stimulus package. She voted in 2011 to raise the debt limit to 16.7 trillion dollars. She opposes any move to privatize Social Security and supports keeping it strictly federally funded.

==== Healthcare ====
Sánchez opposes the privatization of Medicare in any form, and opposes spending cuts to Medicare. Instead she supports expanding healthcare coverage by a number of programs through federal funding.  She has stated that she believes healthcare is a basic right. However, when asked whether she supports the universal health care bill HR 676 by Rep. John Conyers, she declined to vote in favor of it, citing the need to support the Affordable Care Act.


==== Abortion ====
Sánchez is pro-choice and has voted against repealing federal funding for abortions. She opposed legislation to bar transporting minors between states for abortions and making it a crime to harm a fetus in another crime. According to research done by Project Vote Smart, they were able to determine the folowing:

On October 4, 2011, Sánchez made a statement on the LGBT History Month, saying: "We must continue to strive to end discrimination in the workplace based on sexual orientation and fight so that all Americans have the right to marry and start families with those they love. I remain committed to supporting marriage equality, investments in HIV/AIDS care, treatment and research, and campaigns that take action against bullying in schools."On a letter written on February 9, 2010 to President Barack Obama, then-Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, Senator Charles Schumer, Sánchez explained how "Currently, U.S. citizens and legal permanent residents may sponsor their spouses (and other immediate family members) for immigration purposes. But, same-sex partners committed to spending their lives together are not recognized as "families" under U.S. immigration law and thus do not have this same right." and how "This is unacceptable, and we believe comprehensive immigration reform legislation must include a strong family reunification component inclusive of LGBT families."


==== Drug policy ====
Sánchez is pro-drug reform and supports allowing people with drug-related convictions to receive student loans if they are deemed to be rehabilitated. She also seeks to expunge records of first-time drug offenders after probation.


==== Environment ====
She opposes legislation that would bar the Environmental Protection Agency from regulating emissions. Sánchez is in favor of higher emission standards and establish tradable allowances.  She supports the cash-for-clunkers program and seeks to increase public transportation and trains through federally funded projects.Sánchez supports the addition of several species to the IUCN Red List and promotes more extensive nature conservation.


=== Davis-Bacon Act ===
Following Hurricane Katrina in late August 2005, President George W. Bush suspended the Davis-Bacon Act, a 1934 law that requires government contractors to pay prevailing wages. Sánchez was a very vocal critic of the suspension, and led the fight to reverse it. Sánchez eventually won, as Bush reversed himself on October 26, 2005.


=== Cyber-bullying prevention ===
In 2009 and again in 2009, Sánchez introduced the "Megan Meier Cyberbullying Prevention Act," H.R. 1966, a bill which would criminalize the use of electronic communications if "the intent is to coerce, intimidate, harass, or cause substantial emotional distress to a person."  This bill is a response to the suicide of Megan Meier, a 13-year-old girl whose 2006 suicide was attributed to cyber-bullying through the social networking website MySpace. The bill has drawn criticism from members of the on-line community, legal scholars, and others who have contended that the bill would infringe the constitutional right of freedom of speech.


== Controversies ==
After the Arizona State Legislature passed State Senate Bill 1070 and after Arizona Governor Jan Brewer signed it into law, Sánchez generated controversy when she claimed that the law, and similar laws throughout the United States, were the product of white supremacists: "There's a concerted effort behind promoting these kinds of laws on a state-by-state basis by people who have ties to white supremacy groups. It's been documented. It's not mainstream politics." Rep. Gary Miller called Sanchez's comments "an outrageous accusation." Her comments were also condemned by Steve Poizner.


== Personal life ==

Sánchez married Jim Sullivan on April 13, 2009, in the district office of Congressman John B. Larson, who introduced the two about two years prior to the wedding. The marriage is the second for Sánchez, and Sullivan has three sons Brendan, Jack and Seamus from a previous marriage. On May 13, 2009, she became the 8th woman to have given birth while serving in Congress when she gave birth to her first son, Joaquin Sánchez Sullivan.Sánchez's father, Ignacio, suffers from Alzheimer's disease, which Sánchez has cited as a motivation for finding a cure for the disease.She is the younger sister of former Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, who is nine years her senior, making them the first and to date only sister pair to serve in Congress.

== Works ==
Linda Sánchez, Loretta Sánchez and Richard Buskin, Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress, Grand Central Publishing (September 2, 2008) ISBN 978-0-446-50804-9, foreword by Nancy PelosiIn 2008 sister congresswomen Loretta Sánchez and Linda Sánchez published the joint memoir Dream in Color: How the Sánchez Sisters Are Making History in Congress. Publishers Weekly reviewed the book and wrote: "Linda and Loretta Sánchez present their compelling story—noteworthy not only for their history-making achievements (including first sisters or women of any relation to serve together in Congress, first woman and person of color to represent a district in Orange County, first Latina on the House Judiciary Committee and first Head Start child to be elected to Congress) but also for its "American Dream" aspect—their parents immigrated from Mexico and despite lacking a formal education managed to send their seven children to college. Interweaving childhood vignettes with accounts of serving in Congress, both from California, this refreshing book evades many of the tropes of the typical political memoir—perhaps because these two women are not typical politicians."
