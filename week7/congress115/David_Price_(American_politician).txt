=== Elections ===
1986–1992Price first entered Congress in 1987 after defeating one-term Republican U.S. Congressman Bill Cobey 56% to 44%. Price won re-election in 1988 and 1990 with 58%. In 1992, he won re-election with 65%.
1994In 1994, he was narrowly defeated by Republican challenger and former Raleigh police chief Fred Heineman,  who won by a margin of less than 1% during the Republican Revolution, in part to lower-than-expected turnout in the Democratic stronghold of Orange County (home to Chapel Hill), but despite the fact that heavily Republican Randolph County had been eliminated from the Fourth District during redistricting prior to that election year.
1996In 1996, Price defeated Heineman in a rematch 54% to 44%. He was helped in part by voters who were not happy with the lack of progress made by the freshman class on the goals of the Contract with America.
1998–2006The district has since reverted to form, and Price won re-election by wide margins in 1998 (57%), 2000 (62%), 2002 (61%), 2004 (64%), and 2006 (65%).
2008–2016Price's opponent in the 2008 election was Republican B.J. Lawson. Lawson was called the most formidable opposition Price has faced since he was defeated by Heineman in 1994. For example, he ran television ads, which Price's opponents hadn't done in at least a decade. Despite increased efforts and expenditures by his Republican opponent, Price still defeated Lawson 63% to 37%.Price launched his 2010 reelection campaign on September 8 of that year. Price defeated Lawson in a rematch 56% to 44%.Price defeated Republican nominee and businessman Tim D'Annunzio in 2012.
