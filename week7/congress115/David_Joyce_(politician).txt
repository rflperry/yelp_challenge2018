=== Elections ===
2012
In July 2012, U.S. Congressman Steve LaTourette of Ohio's 14th congressional district announced that he would be retiring in 2012, rather than seek re-election. Joyce was appointed as the replacement nominee on the Republican ticket.Joyce ran in the November general election against perennial Democratic Party candidate Dale Virgil Blanchard, Libertarian David Macko and Green Party candidate Elaine Mastromatteo. Joyce won the election with 54% of the vote.
2014In February 2013, Roll Call reported that Steve Israel, head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, had names Joyce's seat as one of the party's top four targets in 2014. The House Majority PAC made Joyce one of its top targets to oust in the 2014 elections.In 2014, according to one news source, Joyce "survived a grueling primary against a tea party-backed candidate," and then faced "an equally tough challenge from Michael Wager."David Joyce won 63.3% of the vote, with Wager receiving 33% and independent David Macko winning 3.7%.
2016Joyce defeated Wager again, 62.6% to 37.4%.
2018In April 2017, Betsy Rader, a Democrat, announced that she would be running against Joyce in 2018. Rader is a lawyer who represents victims of employment discrimination. Rader said that she supported "much" of the Affordable Care Act, but admitted that health care was "an issue I've got to study more." Rader criticized Joyce for opposing an increase in the minimum wage and for wanting to withdraw federal funding for Planned Parenthood.In October 2017, Pastor Darrell Scott, CEO of President Trump's National Diversity Coalition, announced he was thinking of running against Joyce in 2018 for the GOP Congressional nomination. He said that the district needed someone who stood more firmly with the President. Charlie Frye, Chairman of the Ashtabula Republican Party, supported Scott, saying he liked Joyce but did not like the way he votes.

Asked about his legislative priorities in March 2016, Joyce cited terrorist threats, job growth, government spending, the national debt, environmental protection of the Great Lakes, and health care.The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy ranked Joyce as the 29th most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives during the 114th United States Congress and the most bipartisan member of the U.S. House of Representatives from Ohio.In July 2017, Joyce said that political discourse in the U.S. had reached a "vitriolic" level. "I do know there's a level of frustration out there," he said. "But we need to work together. [President Donald Trump] has gotten into this tug-of-war with the national media. Now we're six months into his presidency ... and infrastructure improvements, tax changes and healthcare law are not getting covered. They are dealing with the Tweet du Jour ... and [Trump's tweets] certainly don't help."Joyce is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, the United States Congressional International Conservation Caucus, the Veterinary Medicine Caucus and the Climate Solutions Caucus.
Health careIn July 2017, Joyce expressed the view that the only viable route to a consensus on health care was to take a bipartisan approach. While admitting that Obamacare was "going to fail" he said that the drafting of the GOP's then-current Senate health-care bill was "even worse than how the Affordable Care Act evolved" and that the GOP's House health-care bill "was too partisan" and that there "is nothing in this Senate bill, that is going to bring down the cost of healthcare."
JobsIn an August 2013 speech, Joyce said that part of the problem with the jobs issue was that there are "3 million jobs every month in this country that go unfilled." He noted that the Cleveland Plain Dealer had fact-checked this number and had "actually came up with a higher number than 3 million." The trouble, he explained, is that employers "can't find people to come to work sober, daily, drug-free and want to learn the necessary skills going forward to be able to do those jobs."
Military and intelligenceIn March 2016, Joyce emphasized his support for the military and intelligence communities. He noted his votes for the strengthening of the Visa Waiver Program in order to "ensure terrorists with Western passports don't enter our country," for restrictions on transferring Guantanamo detainees, and for enhancements in cybersecurity infrastructure. He said, in summary, that he was "committed to giving our soldiers and our intelligence community all of the resources they need to do the job."
Immigration and terrorismAlso in March 2016, Joyce said that he had co-sponsored "several bills that ensured refugees underwent stricter scrutiny in order to prevent a Paris-style attack from happening in the United States."
TransportationIn 2014, Joyce introduced the Safe Streets Act with Congresswoman Doris Matsui. The bill would nationalize transportation "design elements" so that streets would be designed with the safety of drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists in mind.
