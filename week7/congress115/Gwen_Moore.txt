She became a prominent voice against mandatory ID security measures to enter the state capitol. She said  "I am too often reminded [9/11 hijacker] Mohammed Atta had a photo ID.

Moore was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 2004, earning 69.6% of the vote and defeating Republican attorney Gerald Boyle in the general election.

She publicly opposed the investigation into the financial accounting of Planned Parenthood, stating that the investigation "is an unfortunate waste of taxpayer dollars." Moore voted "nay" on Amends Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act to Prohibit Abortion Coverage on October 13, 2011. In March 2012, during the House debate over re-authorizing the Violence Against Women Act, she spoke about her own experience of being sexually assaulted and raped as a child and as an adult, criticizing the all-male Senate Judiciary Committee that voted no on the bill.Over the first session of the 109th Congress, Moore earned 90% and higher legislative agenda approval scores from Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Sierra Club of Wisconsin, and the Service Employees International Union.
