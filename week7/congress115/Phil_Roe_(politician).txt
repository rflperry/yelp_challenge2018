=== Elections ===
2008
Roe defeated incumbent congressman David Davis in the 2008 primary by 500 votes. Davis blamed his loss on votes from Democrats who crossed over to vote for Roe in the open primary. Roe had previously run for the seat in 2006 when 10-year incumbent Bill Jenkins announced his retirement, but lost to Davis in that year's primary.
Roe defeated Democrat Rob Russell, director of the Writing and Communication Center at East Tennessee State University, in the November general election with 72 percent of the vote.  However, it was widely presumed that Roe had clinched a seat in Congress with his victory in the primary; Republicans have held the 1st District seat continuously since 1881, and for all but four years since 1859.

2010Roe won re-election in 2010 with 80.8% of the vote against Democrat Michael Clark.


=== Tenure ===
The 1st is known for giving its congressmen very long tenures in Washington; Roe was only the eighth person to hold the seat in 88 years. 
Roe hired Andrew Duke, a former chief of staff for North Carolina Republican congressman Robin Hayes, as his chief of staff. According to National Journal’s 2009 Vote Ratings, he was ranked as the 101st conservative in the House.On February 5, 2013, Roe introduced the National Desert Storm and Desert Shield War Memorial Act (H.R. 503; 113th Congress) into the House. The bill would authorize the National Desert Storm Memorial Association to establish a memorial to honor members of the armed forces who participated in Operation Desert Storm or Operation Desert Shield. Roe said "I believe we should honor the commitment of every man and woman that honorably serves this country, and I am proud to see this bill move forward."During June 2013, WJHL-TV in Johnson City reported that Roe had written a letter to the federal court in Greeneville on the behalf of Dr. William Kincaid, who had plead guilty to one count of receiving in interstate commerce a misbranded drug. Federal prosecutors under the Independent Payment Advisory Board argued that Dr. Kincaid's driving forces for breaking the law were "money and greed" and because that decision by Kincaid created a "substantial risk of harm to patients," prosecutors also said Kincaid should spend the maximum three years behind bars for fraudulently obtaining federal reimbursement as a healthcare provider.Roe had initially promised to serve only five terms (10 years) in Congress. However, on February 6, 2018; he announced he would run for a sixth term, saying that he needed to continue the work begun when he became chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee.
