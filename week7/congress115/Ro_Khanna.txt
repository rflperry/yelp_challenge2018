His father is a chemical engineer who graduated from the Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) and the University of Michigan, and his mother is a former substitute school teacher. Khanna's maternal grandfather, Amarnath Vidyalankar, was part of India's independence movement, working with Lala Lajpat Rai, and spent years in jail in the pursuit of human rights and freedom.

Subcommittee on Readiness
Subcommittee on Strategic Forces
Committee on the Budget


=== Internet Bill of Rights ===
In April 2018, Nancy Pelosi tapped Khanna to draft the Internet Bill of Rights in wake of Cambridge Analytica's breach and Mark Zuckerberg's testimony to Congress. In October 2018, Khanna released a set of principles for an Internet Bill of Rights, including the right of US citizens to have full knowledge of and control over their personal online data, the right to be notified and consent when an entity seeks to collect or sell one's personal data, and the guarantee of Net Neutrality. Khanna hopes these principles will spark legislation to protect online privacy.The inventor of the World Wide Web, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, has endorsed Khanna's set of principles for the Internet Bill of Rights, saying, "This bill of rights provides a set of principles that are about giving users more control of their online lives while creating a healthier internet economy.‚ÄùFormer Secretary of State Hillary Clinton praised the efforts to establish an Internet Bill of Rights in her keynote speech at Oxford University's Mansfield College, saying, "it is past time to demand that all nations and corporations respect the right of individuals to control their own data... There is important work now being done by technologists like Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the World Wide Web, and Ro Khanna, the US Congressman representing Silicon Valley. They are trying to develop guidelines for how this could work."


=== Technology and manufacturing jobs ===
Khanna's Valor Act passed both the House and the Senate and was signed by President Trump on November 21, 2017. The bill will make it easier for companies to offer veterans apprenticeships.On Kara Swisher's Recode Decode podcast, Khanna laid out his vision for how Silicon Valley needs to give back to all Americans. Khanna has also been a longtime supporter of bringing advanced manufacturing jobs across America and has written a book on the topic, Entrepreneurial Nation: Why Manufacturing Is Still Key To America's Future.In March 2017, Khanna traveled to Paintsville, Kentucky, also known as "Silicon Holler", along with a bipartisan delegation from Congress, to lend support to TechHire Eastern Kentucky, a program that trains Kentuckians in fields like computer technology and coding. Khanna expressed support for a broad technology apprenticeship program, which could help areas of the United States like Appalachia by giving blue collar Americans the skills they need to launch future careers in the technology sector. The press has dubbed Khanna the "Ambassador of Silicon Valley."In May 2017, Khanna stood up for the Appalachian Regional Commission and Manufacturing Externship Partnership, a Reagan-era policy, when Trump's proposed 2018 budget zeroed out its funding. Khanna called for quadrupling the program's budget.Khanna passed his first piece of legislation, as the lead Democrat, with Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy to enable veterans to use GI funding for tech training programs.Khanna called on Silicon Valley executives and technology companies to do more all across the country to create tech jobs and diversify their recruiting efforts by making sure to recruit the next generation of tech workers from not just Ivy League institutions but also from state schools and historically black colleges and universities. In a Washington Post op-ed he authored, Khanna wrote, "Tech companies must offer an aspirational vision of how all Americans, regardless of geography, can benefit from a tech-driven economy. This means making investments not just in California, Massachusetts, and New York, but also in start-ups and entrepreneurs in cities and rural communities across the nation."In February 2018, Khanna and Representative Tim Ryan led a tour of venture capitalists encouraging them to invest in middle America.Khanna has been described as an "unconventional ambassador" for the Democratic Party in bringing tech and innovation across America.


=== Economics ===
Khanna has called on his colleagues to adopt a more progressive economic platform. He is an original co-sponsor of Senator Bernie Sanders's bill to make college affordable to all. He also has proposed $1 trillion expansion of the earned income tax credit (EITC), financed by a financial transaction tax, to help working families across America.In the Budget Committee, Khanna pointed out that Trump was for a single payer healthcare system in 2000. He now supports a bill to provide "Medicare for All" in the House.Fred Hiatt, the editor of the Editorial Page of the Washington Post, has suggested that Khanna is a thoughtful and new economic voice for the Democratic Party.Khanna has co-sponsored the Reward Work Act of 2018, to reform US labor law and corporate law by guaranteeing the right of employees in listed companies to elect one-third of the board of directors.


=== NO PAC Caucus ===
Khanna co-founded the NO PAC Caucus in Congress with two other members: Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas) and Jared Polis (D-Colo.). Three other members of Congress now refuse all contributions from political action committees: Phil Roe (R-TN), Francis Rooney (R-FL), and John Sarbanes (D-MD). These members do not want to fill out questionnaires and pledge positions to political action committees in exchange for contributions. Khanna and O'Rourke also introduced a bill to ban PACs from giving contributions to members of Congress.Khanna has worked with constitutional scholar Bruce Ackerman and Senator Russ Feingold to propose a plan for "Democracy Dollars". Under the proposal, every American citizen would get $50 to spend on federal elections. Khanna has also worked across the aisle with Representative Mike Gallagher on reform proposals.


=== Reforming H1B abuse ===
Khanna co-sponsored H.R.1303, a bipartisan companion bill to the H-1B and L-1 Visa Reform Act of 2017 designed to prevent the exploitation of foreign workers while still recognizing the contributions immigrants make to our economy. The bill would overhaul the H-1B and L-1 visa programs to protect American workers and crack down on the outsourcing of American jobs abroad.


=== Monopolistic behavior ===
Khanna founded and co-chairs the Antitrust Caucus in the United States House of Representatives. He has called for a reorientation of antitrust policy to consider the impact on jobs, wages, small business, and innovation, and called for scrutiny on the Whole Foods/Amazon merger.In 2018, along with Senator Bernie Sanders, Khanna proposed the BEZOS Act, which would tax firms for every dollar that employees earn in government health-care benefits or food stamps. The law would also make it illegal for any large company to investigate whether or not a potential employee receives federal assistance. Khanna's rationale for the legislation was that it would force corporations to increase salaries for workers or pay for the welfare programs their employees rely on. Economists at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities published an analysis of the bill finding that it would hurt low-wage workers by giving corporations incentives not to hire workers that rely on federal assistance programs. Khanna challenged Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos directly, saying that if Bezos "announced that [he] would pay everyone at least a $15 minimum wage and reliable hours, [he] could set the standard.‚Äù In response to Sanders's and Khanna's legislation and criticism, on October 2, 2018, Bezos announced that Amazon would raise wages of all employees to $15 an hour, effective November 2018.Khanna wrote a letter to the inspector general of the Department of Defense requesting that he look into TransDigm Group, an aviation-parts manufacturer, and supplier of companies like Boeing. In his letter, Khanna said TransDigm may be bypassing rules that protect U.S. taxpayers since the manufacturer conducts business with the Pentagon. He said he wants to make sure the TransDigm Group is not adding unnecessary costs to the U.S. taxpayer and is not contributing to the $54 billion increase in defense spending proposed by the Trump administration.


=== Foreign policy ===
On January 18, 2018, Khanna organized a group of 33 members of the US House of Representatives to sign a letter urging Trump to re-establish military to military communications with North Korea. Khanna also called for two other steps that should be taken to alleviate tension with the DPRK. First he reintroduced a bill explicitly stating that the President of the United States should not be allowed to launch a nuclear strike without congressional approval, and Khanna also called upon Trump to send a bipartisan team to negotiate directly with the North Koreans.On November 13, 2017, the House of Representatives passed a resolution condemning civilian deaths, starvation and the spread of disease in Yemen, admitting that much of the responsibility for that humanitarian crisis rests with the U.S. because of its support for a Saudi-led military intervention, and noting that the war has allowed al Qaeda, ISIL, and other groups to thrive. Khanna, along with Representative Jim McGovern, co-sponsored the resolution on the House floor. The resolution passed with a bipartisan majority of 366-30.On September 27, 2017, Khanna along with Representatives Thomas Massie, Mark Pocan, and Walter B. Jones Jr., submitted a bipartisan bill on the floor of the House that would halt U.S. military assistance to the Saudi-led campaign in Yemen on the grounds that Congress has never approved the American role in the war. In a joint statement with Pocan, Khanna said, "we aim to restore Congress as the constitutionally mandated branch of government that may declare war and retain oversight over it." Khanna, Pocan, and Jones penned an op-ed for The New York Times detailing the human cost of the continued war in Yemen, saying, "We believe that the American people, if presented with the facts of this conflict, will oppose the use of their tax dollars to bomb and starve civilians in order to further the Saudi monarchy's regional goals."Khanna, a supporter of a more non-interventionist foreign policy, wrote an op-ed for The Los Angeles Times with Senator Rand Paul on June 1, 2017, making the case against military interventions when our security is not at risk. They argued that the nation is weary of perpetual war since 2001, and that calls for regime change abroad have been a mistake. Khanna has been critical of the strikes on Syria.


=== Combating international anti-Semitism ===
On April 25, 2018, 57 members of the House of Representatives, led by Khanna, released a condemnation of Holocaust distortion in Ukraine and Poland. The condemnation came in an open bipartisan letter to Deputy Secretary of State John Sullivan. The letter read in part, "We urge you to join us and human rights organizations in standing against anti-Semitism, xenophobia, and all forms of intolerance by calling for the Polish and Ukrainian governments to unequivocally reject Holocaust distortion and the honoring of Nazi collaborators and fully prosecute anti-Semitic crimes. We also ask that you detail what steps are being taken by the United States (U.S.) government to monitor instances of Holocaust distortion and ensure that the U.S. is not supporting or funding groups and individuals that promote or justify anti-Semitism. We believe these steps must include a firm request that these offensive laws be repealed." California's State Assembly passed a separate resolution calling upon Congress to pressure Polish lawmakers to change this new Holocaust speech law. Andrzej Pawluszek, an adviser to Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki, called the claims in Congress's letter "irresponsible and shocking." The Association of Jewish Organizations and Communities of Ukraine (Vaad of Ukraine) also rebuked the letter, calling it "anti-Ukrainian defamation" like that used by Russian propaganda during the war in Ukraine.
