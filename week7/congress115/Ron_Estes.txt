He was endorsed by the editorial board of the local newspaper, The Wichita Eagle.The National Republican Congressional Committee contributed $92,000, in part for "inflammatory and false" advertisements supporting Estes, which characterized his opponent as an advocate of taxpayer-funded, late-term abortions, and also as an advocate for gender selection abortion.

==== 2018 Regular Election ====

In the 2018 election, the District's Republican incumbent for Congress, Representative Ron Estes is being challenged in the primaries by a candidate that shares a similar name, Ron M. Estes. This has led to a conundrum as to how the candidates should be distinguished on the ballot, with Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach claiming that Ron G. Estes can include the prefix "Rep." on the ballot according to Kansas law, although Ron M. Estes claims that this is unfair.


=== Tenure ===
Rep. Estes was sworn into office on April 25, 2017.
In December 2017, Estes voted in favor of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. In an op-ed for the Wichita Eagle, Estes said he is "confident it will make a real difference for families and businesses in Kansas." He says it will provide economic and job growth, and that workers will see larger paychecks. He says that local companies, including Cessna and Spirit AeroSystems, will be able to "compete on a level playing field with international rivals," as a result of the bill, and that more jobs will return to Kansas from overseas. He says the tax-filing process has been simplified, even though the process remains the same.In July 2017, Estes received national attention for interrupting Rep. Kathleen Rice mid-sentence while she offered a question at a Homeland Security subcommittee hearing. Rice tweeted "Day in the life. Worth noting there are men from both parties who don't act like this" and included a video of the exchange. Estes explained that he was simply trying to follow committee rules after Rice's time was up.
