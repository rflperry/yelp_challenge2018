The office in question, which was opened in 2018, is inside the West Palm Beach Veterans Affairs facility. In 2018 he introduced a House bill that would make it easier for other House members to do the same.


=== Immigration ===
Mast has been supportive of President Trump's immigration policy, and refused to explicitly criticize the president over the official policy of separating children from parents caught entering the U.S. illegally. “It is our duty as an American government to deal compassionately with any child from any nation just as it is the responsibility of foreign families seeking asylum in the U.S. to choose only legal means to enter our nation so they can avoid family disruption,” Mast stated. “I am confident this process will be improved.” Citing his own Mexican grandparents, he said, “The way that they got to work, the way that they assimilated to the American way of life and became a part of our system is not what we’re seeing across the board.”In June 2018, a volunteer for the Democratic Party of Martin County, was arrested after having called Mast's Washington office Monday and saying, “I'm going to find the congressman's kids and kill them.”


=== Gun policy ===
Mast is a supporter of the Second Amendment, calling it "unimpeachable."Mast supports a ban on assault weapons in the United States, citing his military background—"I cannot support the primary weapon I used to defend our people being used to kill the children I swore to defend."Mast rejects the idea that the Second Amendment protects the rights of civilians to bear "any and all" arms.
Following the Stoneman Douglas High School shooting, Mast announced his support for the following policies: prohibiting the sale of assault and tactical firearms without confiscating such weapons that are already owned, ensuring that all firearm purchasers undergo a background check, improving background checks, banning the sale of gun accessories that enhance the firing rate of weapons, such as bump stocks, preventing those who have been detained for mental illnesses from purchasing firearms, ensuring that those on the Terror Watch List cannot purchase firearms, and placing anyone who makes threats of violence against schools on an FBI watch list for "a long time."
Mast also supports conducting further research on gun violence, which is currently prohibited in some ways by federal law.Mast has blamed violent video games and violent movies as at least partly responsible for school shootings.
In March 2017, Mast voted in favor of the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which would have allowed veterans who are considered "mentally incompetent" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge.
The measure passed the House of Representatives, but ultimately stalled in the Senate.
From 2015–2016, Mast accepted $4,950 USD in campaign donations from the NRA's Political Victory Fund.


=== Donald Trump ===
In June 2016, Mast said he supported Donald Trump "unanimously and wholeheartedly" in the 2016 presidential election. After the Billy Bush tape became public, he called Donald Trump's remarks "inexcusable and disgusting."

=== Healthcare ===
Mast is in favor of repealing the Affordable Care Act (Obamacare). On May 4, 2017, he voted to repeal the Affordable Care Act and pass the American Health Care Act.


=== Drugs ===
Mast supports the right of states to set their own marijuana laws, including the right to medical marijuana, without federal interference.


=== Agricultural subsidies ===
In April 2018, Mast said he would probably vote for legislation to reduce support for sugar farmers, who under the then current Farm Bill were protected by fixed minimum prices, by limits on imports and on domestic production, and by government loans to sugar growers. “I expect I'll be supporting it when it comes up for a vote next week,” Mast said of the Sugar Policy Modernization Act, “because it's important to the community I represent, and our waterways.” The proposed act, reported TC Palm, “would make sugar import quotas more flexible and protect taxpayers from government-funded buyouts of surplus sugar.” Mast said he would “probably be the only representative in the history of this district to vote against the sugar industry.”


=== Taxes and budget ===
In October 2017, Mast voted against the original version of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 due to "out of control" federal spending, fear of the national debt growing, and a desire to see lower tax rates with loopholes closed. In December 2017, he voted in favor of the final version of the bill. He says the bill "provides a lot of confidence to a lot of people" and is "a great moment for our country and our community."


=== International diplomacy ===
Mast said he would support a Republican proposal to cut U.S. funding to the United Nations.Mast was not an admirer of Obama's Middle East policy. “ISIS is as strong as it is because of a lack of US leadership,” he said in 2016 “ISIS could have been defeated at the time of the Arab Spring if we had sent in special operations forces. What’s being done now is too little too late. It’s going to require an all-out military effort. The only way to guarantee peace is to make the enemy surrender.”


=== Israel ===
Mast is “a vocal supporter of Israel and Israelis,” reported the Times of Israel during his 2016 campaign. “If anyone was lobbing rockets into the US, guys like me would be sent to kill them, and Americans would applaud us,” he said.


=== Gay rights ===
Mast opposed the US Supreme Court decision that ruled that prohibitions on same-sex marriage were unconstitutional.


=== Abortion ===
Mast believes abortion should be illegal in some, except in cases of rape or incest.


=== Iran deal ===
Mast views Obama's Iran nuclear deal as a betrayal by the US of its own national security as well as that of Israel, Jordan, and other regional allies. “The deal has aligned us with a Shia regime, which is just enabling extremism. This is going to make it very hard to get Sunni regimes to align with us, and Putin is now the go-to player in Syria with his alliance with Assad” he said in 2016.


== Honors ==
During his twelve years of service in the U.S. Army, he received the Bronze Star Medal, Purple Heart, Defense Meritorious Service Medal and Army Commendation Medal with "V" for valor device.
He was invited by President Barack Obama as a guest to his 2011 State of the Union Address and was seated with First Lady Michelle Obama and Second Lady Jill Biden.
