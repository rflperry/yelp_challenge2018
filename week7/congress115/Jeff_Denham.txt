A member of the Republican Party, he is the U.S. Representative for California's 10th congressional district. Denham first won election to the U.S. House in 2010, representing California's 19th congressional district for one term before redistricting led him to run in the 10th district in 2012.
From 2002 to 2010, Denham served in the California State Senate, representing the 12th District, which includes Madera, Merced, Monterey, San Benito, and Stanislaus counties. Prior to seeking political office, Denham served on active and reserve status in the United States Air Force for 16 years, and served in both Operation Desert Storm in Iraq and Operation Restore Hope in Somalia.
Denham has been especially active in immigration issues, notably in the effort to draft and pass legislation that would successfully resolve the status of Dreamers.

== California State Senate ==


=== Elections ===
2002Denham ran for the State Senate in 2002 against former Democratic State Assemblyman Rusty Areias. The race featured a number of negative political advertisements and was one of the most expensive legislative races in state history, with over $6.3 million spent. Denham's campaign highlighted Areias's financial difficulties, including unpaid taxes and did not focus on Areias's state policy positions. Denham's negative campaign tactics drew widespread criticism, including from fellow Republicans.The election was on November 5, 2002, but the vote count was close; the lead in the race went back and forth for several days. Denham won by 1,843 votes, 48% to 47%.
2006In November 2006, Denham won re-election to a second term with 58% of the vote.
2008 recall attemptIn 2008, a recall effort was instigated against Denham by Democrat Don Perata after Denham declined to cast a deadlock-breaking vote on the state budget. Supporters of the recall turned in more than 60,000 signatures with the recall scheduled to appear on the ballot on June 3, 2008. In early May, Perrata called off the efforts to recall Denham, but the election was already on the ballot. Denham easily survived the recall by a 75.4% to 24.6% margin. Denham himself speculated that the recall effort actually helped, rather than hurt, his political career by raising his profile.
2009 Lieutenant Governor and State Assembly campaignsDenham announced in December 2008 that he would be a candidate for Lieutenant Governor of California in the 2010 election. He ended his campaign soon after Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger, in November 2009, appointed Republican State Senator Abel Maldonado to fill the vacancy left by the resignation of Lieutenant Governor John Garamendi, a Democrat, who was elected to Congress.Denham then campaigned briefly for the State Assembly seat being vacated by Tom Berryhill of Modesto, but in late December 2009 he dropped out of that race to run for Congress.

==== 2014 ====

In 2014, Denham ran unopposed in the Republican primary. Denham's Democratic opponent was Michael Eggman.

Denham ran for re-election in 2016. He finished first in the top-two primary on June 7, 2016, and again faced Eggman, who placed second, in the general election on November 8, 2016.

==== 2018 ====

In May 2017, investor Josh Harder became the third Democrat to announce that he would challenge Denham in 2018. He said he would focus on job creation and economic opportunity. “There’s just not a lot of opportunities for entry-level positions,” Harder said. “What we need [is] a better, positive vision for what the economic development of the valley can bring.”The Modesto Bee wrote on May 12, 2018, that “Jeff Denham is going to be hard to beat.” By this point, the original field of Democratic candidates had been cut in half from ten. In addition to Harder, they included Sue Zwahlen, a former ER nurse and school board member; Michael Eggman, a former farmer who had challenged Durham in 2014 and 2016; Virginia Madueño, the former mayor of Riverbank; and Michael Barkley, a socialist. Harder won the Democratic nomination with 16.7% of the primary vote and will face Denham in the general election. Harder has been endorsed by former President Barack Obama.

Regarding his vote, Denham described the bill as a "win for the Valley" he represents and he said "everyone will see an increase in their paychecks in 2018."

Vote Smart, a non-profit, non-partisan research organization that collects and distributes information on candidates for public office in the United States, "researched presidential and congressional candidates' public records to determine candidates' likely responses on certain key issues."

=== Tax reform ===
In December 2017, Denham helped the Republican Party pass the Trump tax bill, which he called “a historic milestone” that would simplify the tax code, improve the economy, and reduce families' tax burdens. “Congress has delivered on our promise to lower taxes for the middle class,” he said, calling the bill “a win for the valley and for everyone who will see an increase in their paychecks in 2018.” He celebrated the doubled child tax credit and said the law would make local growers “more globally competitive.”


=== Employment ===
Appearing on NPR in May 2018, he spoke up for the stricter requirements for food stamps in the new farm bill, which he said would encourage able-bodied people without children to take care of at home to find work.


=== Animal rights ===
In September 2014, the Humane Society Legislative Fund endorsed Denham. The HSLF's Wayne Pacelle said Denham was “leading the charge on some of the most important animal protection issues in Washington.” In the 113th Congress, Denmah was the lead sponsor of the Pets on Trains Act (H.R. 2066), which required Amtrak to allow companion animals on some passenger trains. He led the effort in the House Agriculture Committee to defeat the “King amendment,” which would nullify hundreds of state and local laws on food safety, animal welfare, and agriculture. He was a lead sponsor of the Egg Products Inspection Act Amendments (H.R. 1731), which would improve the treatment of hundreds of millions of laying hens. He co-sponsored the Prevent All Soring Tactics (PAST) Act (H.R. 1518) to strengthen the federal law against the use of caustic chemicals to on the hooves and legs of show horses to induce a high-stepping gait. He also co-sponsored the Animal Fighting Spectator Prohibition Act (H.R. 366), which made it a federal crime to attend or bring a child to a dogfight or cockfight.In April 2018, Denham introduced a law that would forbid the consumption of dog or cat meat. “If passed,” reported the Washington Post, “the ban would send a clear signal that the United States condemns the dog and cat meat trades in East Asia.” Denham said that the law would signal “that the U.S. will not tolerate this disturbing practice in our country” and would demonstrate “our unity with other nations that have banned dog and cat meat, and it bolsters existing international efforts to crack down on the practice worldwide.”


=== Drug policy ===
Denham has a "D" rating from marijuana legalization group National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws (NORML) regarding his voting record on cannabis-related matters. He is active in working with law enforcement to halt illegal growing of cannabis. Denham opposes the legalization of recreational marijuana, saying that "legalizing drugs, including marijuana, is a detriment to society and will endanger future generations." He voted for allowing veterans access to medical marijuana, if legal in their state, per their Veterans Health Administration doctor's recommendation, the second time the Veterans Equal Access Amendment was introduced in 2016.


=== Environment ===
As of January 2018, he had a 6% lifetime score from the environmental advocacy group the League of Conservation Voters.


=== Economic issues ===
Denham has argued that the national deficit is the biggest issue for the United States, and called it a threat to the nation's freedom.In July 2012, he criticized an event put on by the General Services Administration, which cost $268,732. He said that he believed that the controversy went even further than the GSA.Denham voted against raising the debt ceiling in 2013, which led to the United States federal government shutdown of 2013. He also voted against the bill that reopened the government and avoided a default.Denham voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, which he praised as "a historic milestone". Denham's vote was criticized by Democratic opponent T. J. Cox, who claimed the bill would "cost $1.43 trillion over the next decade".


=== Healthcare ===
On April 26, 2017, Denham told The Hill that he was not in favor of the American Health Care Act (AHCA). Denham said that he could only support a repeal-bill that kept significant parts of Obamacare intact, such as coverage for pre-existing conditions and expanded Medicaid coverage. However, on May 4, 2017, Denham voted to repeal the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (Obamacare) and pass AHCA. Denham said that he voted for the revised version of AHCA, which allows states to seek a waiver to allow insurers to charge individuals with preexisting conditions higher premiums, because the bill would provide $8 billion over five years to help those with pre-existing conditions. He voted for this version of the bill before the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office had estimated its impact; the CBO had estimated that 24 million Americans would lose insurance under the previous version of the bill.


=== High-speed rail ===
Denham, who is chairman of the House Subcommittee on Railroads, has opposed plans for a high-speed train between San Francisco and Los Angeles. On March 6, 2017, the New York Times quoted him as saying that “no more federal dollars will go to California high-speed rail.” He charged that $600 million of state funds allocated by Proposition 1A in 2008 for Caltrain's electrification was being diverted. “'They are stealing Prop 1A money and using it for something else,” Denham said.


=== Immigration ===
In October 2013, Denham co-sponsored the comprehensive immigration reform bill introduced by House Democrats. In announcing his support for the bill, he said: "We can't afford any more delays. I support an earned path to citizenship to allow those who want to become citizens to demonstrate a commitment to our country, learn English, pay fines and back taxes and pass background checks."In August 2014, Denham broke ranks with the Republican Party and voted against a bill that would have dismantled the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals.In the autumn of 2017, Denham unsuccessfully “pleaded with Trump...not to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which provided temporary deportation relief and work permits for hundreds of thousands of people brought to the country illegally as children.”In May 2018, Denham was one of a dozen House Republicans who, defying Speaker Paul Ryan, forced a vote on immigration in an effort to help the so-called Dreamers. In a May 16 interview with Tucker Carlson, Denham said that “the only way we're going to get the border secured is actually working together to pass something off the floor.” In order to gain support for the Mexican border wall, he said, Republicans must support action to help Dreamers. “The only way you're going to get the 60 members on a bipartisan border security bill is with this solution that is equally as important that the president of the United States is asking for.”Denham said in June 2018 that he had forged an agreement with more conservative House members that would provide temporary residency visas for young immigrants and that would also fund Donald Trump’s border wall with Mexico.In a June 7, 2018, interview on MSNBC, Denham said, “I want to see a fixed to our broken immigration system” and that “You shouldn't be tearing families apart.” He described the Trump Administration's “zero tolerance policy” as “a bad idea.”


=== Water supply ===
In June 2018, Denham joined three other local members of Congress in introducing legislation “to cut through red tape to raise the spillway gates at New Exchequer Dam and improve water supply reliability for Merced County.” The measure “would provide an additional 57,000 acre-feet for irrigation, groundwater replenishment and environmental benefits.”


=== Social issues ===
In May 2016, Denham initially voted against an amendment to a defense appropriations bills by Democratic Representative Sean Patrick Maloney which would prohibit government contracts with companies that don't comply with President Obama's executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating against LGBT workers. The following week, Denham reversed course and voted for Maloney's amendment to uphold President Obama's executive order banning federal contractors from discriminating based on sexual orientation or gender identity.


=== 2016 presidential race ===
Denham did not make an endorsement in the 2016 presidential race. He said that he planned to support the Republican nominee but did not specifically endorse Donald Trump, and that "Like many Americans from both parties, my first choice for president is not on the ballot in November."


=== FEMA reforms ===
On November 21, 2017, Denham introduced the Supporting Mitigation Activities and Resiliency Targets for Rebuilding Act, also known as the SMART Rebuilding Act. The SMART Rebuilding Act, which proposed cost-saving Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) reforms, was included in the U.S. House's subsequent Disaster Recovery Reform Act and supplemental appropriations bill. The disaster aid package, which included $81 billion in additional disaster relief funding in addition to Denham's FEMA reforms, was passed by the House in December 2017 in a bipartisan vote.

She is Hispanic, and Denham has said that he learned Spanish to communicate with her family, including to help his Mexican father-in-law through the process of gaining U.S. citizenship.
