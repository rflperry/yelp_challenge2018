== U.S. House of Representatives ==


=== 2016 campaign ===
In May 2016, incumbent Republican congressman Curt Clawson announced he would not run for a third full term. Soon afterward, Rooney entered the Republican primary to succeed him—the real contest in this heavily Republican district. Rooney spent $4 million of his own money and far outspent his opponents in an election that was shortened due to the timing of Clawson's late announcement. In the August 30 primary, he defeated Sanibel Councilman Chauncey Goss and radio personality Dan Bongino. Rooney received an unprecedented endorsement from Rick Scott, who is his neighbor in the Naples, Florida Port Royal community. As expected, he won handily in the November general election to become only the fifth person to represent this district since its creation in 1983 (it had been the 13th District from 1983 to 1993, the 14th from 1993 to 2013, and has been the 19th since 2013).

Rooney is in favor of having Pell Grants turn into Stafford Loans if students who were awarded the grants do not graduate within six years of receiving their award.

==== Gun policy ====
As of 2017, Rooney has a "B" rating from the NRA, indicating a voting record that generally supports gun rights.
As a Congressman, Rooney has voted in favor of several pieces of legislation to expand gun rights, including a yes vote on H. R. 38 (the Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act), which would enable concealed carry reciprocity among all States if and when it is signed into law.
In March 2017, Rooney voted in favor of the Veterans Second Amendment Protection Act, which, if signed into law, will allow veterans who are considered "mentally incompetent" to purchase ammunition and firearms unless declared a danger by a judge.

The proposal includes supporting the Fix NICS Act of 2017, mandating background checks for every firearm purchase, and enacting a gun violence restraining order system to provide a legal justification for temporarily confiscating firearms from those deemed a threat to themselves or others.
Rooney also supports a mandatory 3-day waiting period for all gun sales, a ban on bump stocks, and raising the minimum age to purchase any firearm to 21.
Additionally, his proposal included making schools more secure and hiring veterans and retired law enforcement officers as armed security guards for schools.

Rooney sat on the board of the Tulsa, Oklahoma based petroleum and natural gas exploration and production company, Laredo Petroleum that was accused in 2012 of underpaying royalties to landowners of property where the company was conducting operations. The lawsuit, filed by Chieftain Royalty Company, alleged that "Laredo used its position as operator and as an oil and gas working interest owner to secretly underpay royalty due plaintiff and class members on production of gas and its constituents from the Oklahoma Well," and the company had been "unjustly enriched." Rooney owns 1 million shares of Laredo Petroleum and had been on the board since 2010. Despite denying the allegations made in the lawsuit Laredo settled the claim for $6.6 million.


=== Deep state comments ===
Francis Rooney has made statements suggesting that he believes in the existence of a Deep state in the United States.

Rooney stated there ought to be a "purge" within those departments. Rooney suggested this is evidenced by the fact that there were isolated incidents among members of those agencies who were documented as having been demoted or, where relevant, removed from the Trump-Russia Investigation for having expressed anti-Trump bias and/or Pro-Hillary Clinton bias.


=== Advocacy of purging the FBI ===
Rooney attracted national attention in December 2017 when he suggested that the FBI be purged of agents that he believed were "politically compromised", and saying he felt "pretty frustrated" with FBI officials in their investigation of Trump; by so doing, Rooney is putting himself squarely in the corner of Donald Trump, according to several sources.
