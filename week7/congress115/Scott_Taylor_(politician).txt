=== House of Representatives ===


==== 2016 election ====
In 2016, after the incumbent Scott Rigell, a Republican, announced he would not seek re-election, Taylor won the Republican nomination for Virginia's 2nd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives, defeating Randy Forbes in the primary, then defeated Democrat Shaun Brown, 61.3% to 38.5%, to win the general election on November 8, 2016. Taylor is a member of the Republican Main Street Partnership, as well as of the Republican Study Committee.


==== 2018 election and ballot fraud investigation ====
In May 2018, former Navy commander Elaine Luria announced her intention to run for Taylor's seat. In the June 10 Democratic primary, Luria received 62% of the vote, defeating Karen Mallard, who received 38%. On the Republican side, Taylor readily defeated Mary Jones, 76% to 24%.On August 7, 2018, the Virginia Beach commonwealth's attorney appointed a special prosecutor to investigate possibly fraudulent petitions circulated by members of Taylor's 2018 campaign staff of behalf of by then-independent candidate, Shaun Brown. A FOIA request made by WHRO found that four paid workers on Taylor's campaign had collected signatures to put Shaun Brown on the ballot as an independent candidate in the 2nd district race. Gathering signatures to put another candidate on the ballot is legal, and observers believe that Brown's "appearance on the ballot threatens to split the Democratic vote in a highly competitive race." In August, following allegations that some of the signatures gathered by his staff were forged, Taylor fired his campaign consultant, Rob Catron, saying "My campaign has a zero-tolerance policy for inappropriate activities."On September 5, 2018, after hearing testimony in a civil lawsuit, Richmond Circuit Court Judge Gregory L. Rupe ordered the removal of Brown's name from the 2nd District ballot on the basis that 377 signatures were fraudulently collected for Brown by four Taylor staffers and a former campaign consultant.  The staffers and the former consultant filed affidavits with the court that if called to testify as to whether Taylor directed their efforts to collect or forge the signatures, they would invoke their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.  A criminal investigation into ballot fraud in the matter by a Virginia state special prosecutor continues to be active.


=== Tenure ===
In March 2018, Wallace Grove Godwin was arrested for threatening to murder Taylor. Taylor afterwards responded, "I call on everyone, and I mean everyone, to please calm down....We are all Americans."


=== Political stances ===


==== Abortion ====
Taylor personally opposes abortion and opposes taxpayer funding of abortion but supports a woman's right to decide whether to have an abortion.


==== Military ====
In April 2018, Taylor praised President Trump for the "measured" and "calculated" military action carried out under his direction in Syria in conjunction with the French and British. Taylor said that he was "torn" in regard to taking international military action, but in the case of Syria he felt that Trump "listened to his advisers".


==== LGBT ====
Asked in 2010 about gays in the military, he said, "I encourage everyone to honorably serve in the military regardless of their sexual orientation. Heterosexual relationships are not permitted to take place while our men and women serve their country, so I believe this to be a completely political move."In September 2017, Taylor said he opposed the ban on transgender persons in the military. "If you are able to serve, serve," he said. "I don't care if you are gay, straight, transgender or not. If you are ready to go, cool." He added, however, that the military should not have to pay for gender-reassignment surgery.As of May 2017, Taylor is a cosponsor of H.R. 2282, the version of the Equality Act submitted in the House of Representatives during the 115th Congress.


==== National security ====
Taylor supported President Donald Trump's 2017 executive order to impose a temporary ban on entry to the U.S. to citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. He stated that "While I do not agree with some of the rhetoric, taking a pause, figuring out if we are properly vetting people, and making changes if necessary to continue our American principles is prudent and needed. The safety and protection of our citizens must remain our number one priority."


==== Cannabis legalization ====

On February 27, 2017, Taylor was an original cosponsor for bill H.R. 1227 â€“ Ending Federal Marijuana Prohibition Act of 2017.


==== Healthcare ====
On May 4, 2017, Taylor voted Yes on H.R. 1628 (AHCA of 2017).


==== Energy and the environment ====
Taylor accepts that climate change is happening, but argues that there are questions as to humans' contribution to climate change. Taylor said, "there are the questions about what man can do about" climate change.During Taylor's unsuccessful congressional primary campaign in 2010, he voiced support for offshore oil drilling along Virginia's coast.In 2018, after President Donald Trump announced plans to lift a ban on offshore oil drilling in the Atlantic Ocean, Taylor voiced his opposition, saying that drilling could interfere with military training and citing opposition from localities within his district.In January 2018, Taylor expressed opposition to President Trump's plan to allow offshore drilling in the Atlantic Ocean.


==== Donald Trump ====
In February 2017, following Trump's likening of the intelligence community to Nazi Germany, Taylor said that President Donald Trump and the intelligence community "need to get on the same page very quickly."Asked about President Trump's expenditures of millions of taxpayer dollars on the travel and security of his family, Taylor said that the expenses were "a legitimate concern" but argued that the Obama family spent similar amounts.As of September 2018, FiveThirtyEight has found that Taylor votes with Trump's position 98% of the time.


== Book ==
He published a book in February 2015, Trust Betrayed: Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, and The Selling Out of America's National Security. In his book, he criticized Vice President Joe Biden for revealing that it was SEAL Team Six that killed Osama bin Laden. He blamed the poor diplomatic security that led to the Benghazi fiasco on the Obama administration's desire for a "light footprint" in Libya, which in turn was caused by a foreign-policy doctrine that placed U.S. interests underneath partisan politics.
