=== U.S. Congress ===
On November 8, 2016, Smucker defeated Christina Hartman with 53 percent of the vote in the race to replace the retiring Joe Pitts in Congress.  He was sworn in to represent Pennsylvania's 16th Congressional District on January 3, 2017.A new congressional map imposed by the Pennsylvania Supreme Court renumbered Smucker's district as the 11th District. It picked up the sliver of Lancaster County that had previously been in the 7th District, while losing its shares of Chester and Berks counties. To make up for the loss in population, it was shifted to the west, absorbing much of eastern York County. The old 16th had historically been one of the most Republican districts in Pennsylvania, but the Democratic trend in the areas of the district closer to Philadelphia had resulted in close races at the presidential level. John McCain only carried the old 16th with 51 percent of the vote in 2008, while Mitt Romney won it with 52 percent in 2012 and Donald Trump won it with 51 percent in 2016. According to Nate Cohn of The New York Times, these trends theoretically left Smucker vulnerable in a Democratic wave.In contrast, the new 11th is significantly more rural and Republican than its predecessor. Had it existed in 2016, Trump would have won it with over 60 percent of the vote. According to Cohn, the Republican-controlled state legislature had placed the more Democratic areas of Chester and Berks counties into the 16th in order to protect Republican incumbents in neighboring districts. As Cohn put it, the loss of those areas and the addition of part of York County had the effect of making what was already a "naturally Republican" district even more so.

As of January 2018, Smucker had voted with his party in 95.4% of votes in the 115th United States Congress and voted in line with President Trump's position in 98.3% of votes.
