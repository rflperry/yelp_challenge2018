William Patrick Huizenga (; born January 31, 1969) is an American politician serving as the U.S. Representative for Michigan's 2nd congressional district since 2011. A member of the Republican Party, he previously served in the Michigan House of Representatives from 2003 to 2009.


== Early life, education and private career ==
Huizenga, born to a family of Dutch Americans, is the current co-owner and operator of Huizenga Gravel Company, a third generation business located in Jenison, Michigan. He has been affiliated with it for most of his life.
In the early 1990s, Huizenga obtained his Michigan Real Estate sales license, and he quickly became one of the most successful realtors in southwest Michigan. He left real estate in 1996 when he was recruited by U.S. Representative Peter Hoekstra to be his Director of Public Policy. For six years, from 1996 through 2002, he traveled throughout western Michigan becoming familiar with the various towns and cities, and eventually decided to run for political office.

The district is located in Ottawa County and includes the cities of Holland, Zeeland, Hudsonville, and the four townships of Blendon Township, Jamestown Township, Holland Township, and Zeeland Township.
